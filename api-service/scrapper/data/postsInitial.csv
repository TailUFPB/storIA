Godless,707,87,"You remember when you were young, maybe ten-eleven, maybe twenty-twenty-seven, and you’d ride your bike down a dusty back road, or sometimes I guess maybe a moped or a car, some sort of vehicle that’d carry you far, swallowing bugs and dirt like some overgrown toad?

And sometimes, if you were lucky, unlucky, I guess it depends, you’d spot a path just around the bend, and you’d swear on your mom’s grave - provided she was dead (or maybe your dad's or your grandparents instead) - that the last time you were here, when was that again, a week ago? Maybe two? In any case, you’d swear that the path was brand new.

But it never was.

There’d be an old man sitting by a mailbox, long greying beard, moist-cloudy breath smelling just like chicken pox (or like your hamster, Dre, who hadn’t moved at all since last wednesday). In any case, you’d feel compelled to stop, hop off your bike, emerge from a thick cloud of dust, only to stumble back in fear and disgust.

“This land is Godless,” he’d gargle, throat and mouth and face entangled, melted and morphed and maimed and mangled.

You’d nod and smile, because you shouldn’t be rude, but you’d subconsciously start backing away the moment you knew, the moment you saw, the moment you felt, but there’s no back (or forward) when you’re facing your Death.

“There’s a letter in this box,” the man would say, a skin-dripping finger pointing the way. You’d swallow real deep, and try not to scream - because that finger, that mailbox, was haunting your dreams.

“You’ve read it before, and must read it again.”

“But I *really* don’t wanna,” you’d argue in vain.

The man would smile, and hand you the note; all dressed up in a skin-stained, crawly and maggoty coat.

“Lick it open and feast,” the man would explain, his voice now somehow trapped deep in your brain.

And you did, cause you know, what else could you do? Slurp and lick and suckle and chew, the taste reminiscent of slimy mildew. And the letter within, all covered in blood, is now resting on the uttermost tip of your tongue.

“Godless,” the man sighs, before falling apart, in a lukewarm corpse-soup of flesh, sinew, organs and heart.

You can’t help yourself. You know that you can’t. So you fall to your knees and do your part. First read the letter, just like in your dreams; parchment of torment and laughter and screams. Words like a river of blood-swollen slugs - embracing you then in a tentacled hug.

And suddenly you emerge. Unscathed, but changed. Godless, soulless, nameless.

Estranged.

And then, in a year, maybe three, maybe ten, you’ll see yourself coming down the road again. Maybe on a bike, or a moped, or car (some kind of vehicle that’ll carry you far). You know it’s the end, or the endless I guess, but you will utter the words with conviction regardless;

“This land is Godless.”",1621112504.0
Shit a Brick,66,2," 

I had to admit, when we captured the witch, that she was not at all what I was thinking. As Sven closed the handcuffs around her wrists, I said as much.

“I always thought witches were like old, wrinkly women with gnarly faces and stringy hair.”

“Yeah, or like super hot and seductive,” Sven said. “You know, like they wear their robes open so that their tidbits are barely covered and you get overpowered by their boobiness, then WHAM! They turn you into a frog or a hot dog or something.”

The witch was just staring at us through this whole conversation. I’m pretty sure I saw her roll her eyes at one point.

“But,” I said, “she’s...super normal. She kinda looks like my mom. Just really...plain.”

The witch let out a big sigh.

“It’s almost like you’ve taken all your worst fears about women’s sexuality, or your belief in its perceived decline, and placed them on women in the form of devil worship. Which isn’t even the root of Wicca. Which I don’t believe in, because I’m not a witch…”

“Be quiet, witch!” I said. Then I turned to Sven. “Dude, Fialkov is gonna shit a brick when he sees that our witch is a normal middle-aged woman.”

“He won’t shit a brick,” the witch mumbled, “but I’ll make sure you will.”

We got her locked up and I gave my bosses the rundown on the situation. There’s going to be a nice warm fire in her near future. I ended up going home early, though, because I had the worst stomach ache.

I spent hours in bed in extreme discomfort. As time passed, it felt like I was having the worst gas pains as things slowly moved from my stomach to my intestines. As I got closer to needing to drop a deuce, I started to get scared. Whatever was inside me was massive. It was painful. And it needed to come out.

I got positioned on the toilet with a book. I had a feeling this wouldn’t be a short stay. The pain was so intense, though, that I couldn’t even focus on the novel. I could feel myself opening wider and things getting tighter. I kept stretching beyond what I thought was humanly possible and I could feel my flesh tearing.

I screamed.

And, as I could feel chunks of my body shredding and blood running down my legs, I started to feel woozy. My body began to spasm right before everything went dark.

The next day, Sven came to look for me when I didn’t show up for work. He found me on my bathroom floor, close to bleeding out, my intestines on the floor, my bottom half a bloody mess, and a brick sitting next to me.

“Honestly,” Sven said before he ran for the doctor, “I don’t even want to know.”",1621130894.0
MY BOYFRIEND HAS SKIN SO DRY THAT SOMETIMES HIS KNUCKLES BLEED,2198,120,"My boyfriend has skin so dry that sometimes his knuckles bleed.

It'll happen in the most inconvenient times and the blood will splatter all over;

over the steering wheel, over a tree bark, over our bedroom door, over my face.

&#x200B;

People ask and worry, poor boy with the knuckles always slit,

he seems to be always hurting, not hurting others but hurting me.

We have tried lots of things, creams, ointments, makeup, prayers.

But they always crack again,

crack and splatter,

always in the most inconvenient times;

when we are driving late at night, when we are going to bed, when we are alone.

Maybe it's an allergy thing he seems to be allergic to lots of things;

to my cat, to my friends, to my nails when they are painted bright red.

My grandmother suggested a remedy, a herbal one,

made with flowers of the most beautiful kind.

So we made a little patch of dirt and seeds, in her big backyard.

We got my boyfriend to help, to bring the richest substrate.

And it worked I swear.

Now my nails are bright red,

and his knuckles pale white.",1621053135.0
What Bobby Saw,65,5,"At 8:50 PM, Old Mr. Andrew Hastings was reading a paperback when he heard a frantic knocking. He went to investigate and was shocked to find Bobby Burke, his neighbor’s ten year old son, at his front door, weeping and wailing that someone was dead.

At 9:05 PM, the dark neighborhood streets were lit up by flashing lights as several police cars and an ambulance came screeching to a halt in front of the Burke residence. A few officers went towards the house next door to check on the boy, where Mr. Hastings had already stepped out to greet them. The rest of the officers rushed into the Burke house, guns drawn and at the ready.

At 9:06 PM, the officers found her: a teenage girl sprawled on the floor next to the couch, blood running down from her neck, glassy eyes staring at nothing. One officer sent out an urgent call for the paramedics as the others spread out into the house.

At 9:08 PM, a teary-eyed Bobby - wrapped in a heavy blanket - was in his neighbor’s kitchen telling the police what happened while Mr. Hastings called Bobby’s parents. Bobby told the police he’d been trying to go to sleep when he heard a sound downstairs, like glass breaking.

At 9:10 PM, the paramedics shook their heads. The girl next to the couch had her throat and both arteries opened by the wound on her neck: she’d bled out within seconds.

At 9:11 PM, Bobby shook as he recalled walking downstairs, just in time to see a man in a clown mask open his babysitter’s throat with a knife. He said he didn’t know what else to do, and ran to Mr. Hastings for help.

At 9:12 PM, police found the back door to the Burke house open, glass from the broken window scattered on the floor inside. A kitchen knife lay on the grass outside, slick with crimson.

At 9:31 PM, a station wagon came skidding to a stop in front of Mr. Hastings' house. An officer led the frantic Mr. and Mrs. Burke inside, where they embraced their crying son.

At 9:34 PM the police got the name of the babysitter from Mr. Burke - Jessica Carlyle - and the contact information for her family. Next door, paramedics loaded Jessica’s body into an ambulance.

At 9:36 PM an officer said to the Burkes that he was sorry but their home was a crime scene that needed to be investigated. The family understood, and said they’d stay at a hotel.

At 10:07 PM, the Burkes had checked into a nearby hotel while a frantic Mrs. Carlyle arrived at the hospital.

At 10:12 PM, as Mrs. Carlyle broke down at the sight of her daughter’s body, Bobby Burke was peacefully drifting off to sleep, smiling at the memory of slicing his babysitter’s throat and marveling at how easily everyone had believed his story of a masked intruder.",1621112144.0

Can anyone help me,8,2,"If you're reading this, I'm in need of serious help. This is the last place I can go to. They watch everything else, they read everything else. They see everything I do. If I don't get help soon, they'll kill me.

There are strangers in my home. They talk to me, try to convince me they are trying to 'help' me, when I know. I know. They want to kill me, they want to silence me. Stop me from speaking my truth. Stop me from telling everyone, from telling you, about them.

They try to force me to take strange pills and, when that doesn't work, they put poison in my food, in my drinks. I can't even drink the tap water - they've ruined the supply somehow. I can taste that nasty bitterness in everything.

I try not to drink or eat anything they give me, but I can feel the insidious sickness inside. My fingers tingle, and feet feel as heavy as concrete blocks. My joints scream and sting, and there is an aching in the pit of my stomach. My eyesight is going blurry, and my hair is falling out in clumps and tumbles. Weird itches in my skin, which I scrub at relentlessly in the shower just to wash the poison away, and strange rashes on my limbs.

Maybe they have injected me when I've been asleep; I check myself hourly for marks but of course they are clever. They can do it in places I can't see, can't find. They can do it without me knowing, because they can see and hear everything. They are all knowing, and to me their actions are all consuming. 

I tried to document this in my journals, but they took them away from me. I tried to write on my arms and legs, but they found my pen. I hid a razor and tried the same, but they took that away too. Bastards, they know my only defence is my knowledge of them and I can't even do that any more. My memory is failing now. They know this too.

They took me to a 'doctor', but I know she's one of them. I lied to her, told her I was fine, even as my joints were screaming and my vision was doubling. And the bugs, the bugs they've put in me  I feel them, but I can't let on. They can't really know how I feel, what they are doing to me. I can't let them know that they are getting to me, that they are winning. They won't break me.

""Please eat something honey, you're fading away.""

Another trick. They don't care, if I eat anymore poison God knows what will happen. I think they are spraying it on my things now, my bed, so I sleep on the floor. They are soaking my clothes in it, so I sneak in to their rooms and steal their clothes. I don't think they've noticed.

""Anna for God's sake I'm your mother!""

She screams it at me, and cries, but she's not my mother. Another lie. They took my mother, killed her. Stole her face and put it on this stranger. Ripped away her voice and put it in this stranger. An impostor.

I cry at night, mourning my dead mother. It's an insult they think I'll fall for it, and moreso that this poor fakery sleeps next door. My father was taken and didn't return, murdered by them, and sometimes I cry for him too.

Today I looked at my younger brother, and I knew. He had been taken as well. He tugged at my sleeve and I physically recoiled; how dare this mimic touch me. I pushed him away, and my not-mum yelled. Tonight I shall take care of him, this monster in the shape of my brother.

Sweet Grandma Molly,10,0,"In our hometown, there’s a kid’s rhyme, based on “Ring Around A Rosie”, that went like this:

Sweet Grandma Molly,

We’re all hungry,

Please give us some candies.

We’ll eat til it fills 

Our bellies.

Don’t worry, Grandma Molly,

We’ll save some for

The morning.

When we were girls, we weren’t allowed to sing this rhyme by our parents. I obeyed as I didn’t like to sing anyway; still don’t to this day, but my sister, Mia, didn’t care. Compare to me, she loved to sing; she did it when our parents weren’t home. I wasn’t worried, as it’s just a silly rhyme, right? 

Here’s the important thing:
        
 Like a lot of things, this rhyme began innocently enough. According to old newspapers, Grandma Molly was a real person, whose family used to own a confectionary on Dogwood Street. That place is gone now, but it used to be one of the town’s major attractions. I think it was called “Hefner’s Sweeties” or something like that. You see, Molly was a sweet old lady, no pun, and used to give kids candies almost every day. Halloween was one of her favorite holidays. Until that fateful year, I think it was 1994, when she was found strangled in the shop. A cold case. And her surviving family were so distraught they closed down and moved away. And that’s how we got the kid’s rhyme. But that’s not all.


The confection shop became haunted, as some folks say, and kids began disappearing a year after the murder. Those kids disappeared because they kept singing the song too many times. And Grandma Molly’s ghost took them to eat candies, they say. In other words, this rhyme became a ghostly song.

Back then, I thought ghosts were fake, made up; some made up lore. I was wrong. Now I’m going to tell you we did see her and trust me, it was one of the creepiest experiences in our childhoods. I don’t blame Mia, however. 

It was a nice day, that day, and we sisters played in our backyard. I was looking at my phone while Mia was swinging herself on the swing set. Then she started singing it to herself. Of course, I wasn’t paying attention. But I caught on.

“Mia, shut up,” I told her. 

“It’s just a song,” she replied. She resumed. 
Being a kid, what else? 

Suddenly the wind grew cold. Unusually cold for a warm day. And the smell of candies . . . 
 
Then I saw her. Mia did, too. Grandma Molly stood there smiling at us. The old lady ghost gestured us to follow her. I had goosebumps and chills. Without thinking, I grabbed my sister’s hand and ran for the house. 

Once inside, there was a knock-knock-knock on the door. The house lights flickered like crazy. On and off. On and off.
We cried and screamed; we hushed when it finally stopped.
We stayed inside and never told anyone. Mia never sang the rhyme again.",1621134311.0
Sensation,3,1,"At first we were excited to receive a return signal from deep space, but it soon became apparent that we didn’t take enough into consideration.


What if the species we contact is so foreign, so alien, that it can only communicate with us in some incomprehensible way?


Once the signal entered Earth's atmosphere, the impact became apartment. Every living thing on the planet lost the ability to feel. 


Typically it was called Anaphia, but it became the new norm overnight. Some died, after all, pain is what tells a person they’re in danger. Scientists worked hard to translate the signal, hoping they could reverse the effect if they knew what the other species was trying to communicate. 


The next day, nobody could taste anything. 


Research showed that nothing was biologically wrong with humans, their bodies just didn’t respond to stimuli anymore. Nobody could taste their meals after that, if they could focus enough to make them. The loss of touch also meant balance would be thrown off, so a lot of people were experiencing vertigo in full force. 


The same day that the concept of smell disappeared, some people began to experience unknown phenomena, though they had trouble explaining it to scientists. 


“It’s almost like being able to smell a color.” One man said. 


“No, it’s like FEELING a color.” One woman retorted, wrapping her arms around herself. 


The message was still being translated, but progress had slowed to a halt. Sight was gone. Scientists had to focus on translation, without being able to see what they were working on. As before, people began dying in accidents, as all they could respond to was sound, and still more began to experience strange sensations. 


“I can HEAR heat.” 


“I can SMELL the color red.”


“I can SEE the taste of chicken.”


Scientists had no explanation, and it seemed unlikely in a world without sensory input that they would find one. 


But sometimes we get lucky. Despite all odds, the sun shines on us, and the message was converted into something we would understand. The very next day, sound stopped being a concept, and humans were left in a world without any senses. Luckily, the message had been spread around the world, and all humans were able to hear it before they heard nothing else. 


“Ascend beyond the physical, only then will you understand.”


Whatever these beings were, they didn’t rely on sensation the way life on Earth did. I am not sure if they understood what they were doing, or if they thought we would change to be like them without the senses. Either way, they messed our planet up beyond repair.


Those of us that are left are watching in the ISS. We were able to keep up to date on the events, but were spared from the consequences. 


I wish that was a good thing. All we can really do is buy ourselves some time, nobody is coming to rescue [us.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ninjagall15/comments/mk9dfu/insomniac_bite_sized_scary_stories_now_available/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",1621146765.0
Them,2,1,"Just imagine you’re not lonely,
Someone’s staring, watching,
You cant quite see them in the shadows ,
But you think,
No,
you know they are there,
Just standing, unmoved,
You move,
They follow silently,
Down the street, 
In circles, useless turns,
When you think there gone you feel them again,
Menacingly,
Right behind you, 
Coming closer, 
And closer,
Until they seem to occupy the same space you’re in,
Still just, 
Watching, waiting, 
You hear a soft breathing near by,
And an even softer young child saying,
“Help, I’m stuck help me please save me”,
And then it’s gone, 
Your alone again,
It’s like nothing happened, like they were never there, 
You move to go home checking over your shoulder every, 
10 seconds, 
Thinking it happened, 
But its fading from your memory like it was a dream, 
You get inside and try to go to sleep,
Yet you cant they still seem to be there but not like they, where before, 
Now there just in your memory, 
Watching your thoughts every move you make everything you think, 
They feel it they know you know it, 
Still, 
They won't contact you, 
They won’t speak, 
And they wont let you hear that young girl again,
They wont even let you come close, 
You try to move to where you think the source might be, 
But there’s nothing there, 
But your chair with clothes and the hat you wore against the rain,
So you get back into bed, 
And try to sleep again, 
Still not quite falling asleep, 
Until you do, 
And they come to you in your dream, 
Telling you this was a vision, 
Of the future,
That was your child, 
Being kidnaped by a monster, 
You have yet to know, 
Maybe,
You already know them,
They aren’t sure, 
And they leave never to be seen again, never to be felt again, 
But every time you feel like eyes watching you 
You remember that voice so menacingly and terrifying yet only a dream",1621150829.0
People's voices are so naked,6,1,"Peoples voice's sound so naked don’t they and it’s a horrible thing to know. I am a person who likes to help the homeless and the sickly, and when I see someone who is struggling I get really agitated with urges me to help them. I wish I could be someone who can just not care you know and flow through life but no I must help and make a difference. If everyone didn’t care then the world will be in utter chaos and no one will know who to go to. Recently I have been noticing that peoples voices sound so naked, alone and lost.  

 

I remember meeting up with a past friend and the way he sounded, his voice sounded like it was the loneliest being in the world. I became a little alerted but I made sure my friend couldn’t notice anything. We hung around some more going from places to places and his voice becoming even more naked, cold and stripped of its dignity. When no one was watching I started to stiff my friends mouth with cloth and other objects so that his voice wasn’t naked anymore. My friend just laid on the ground not moving anymore.  

 

I then started to notice that a colleague of mine at work his voice was also naked, abused and enslaved almost. I use to love talking with this colleague but now I couldn’t ignore his shivering voice, which is in need of some covering to regain some of its confidence. In the break room where no one was watching I started to stuff objects and towels into my colleagues mouth, to cloth his naked shivering voice. My colleague then just laid on the ground looking up at the ceiling. His voice wasn’t naked anymore.  

 

I felt good about myself and I love helping the needy and clothing the undignified. I am a liberator and I was a one army man doing this all on my own. Then on the street there is a man who sits at a bench and says hello to me sometimes. He is retired and when he said hello to me every hair stood up on my body. His voice was so naked that it was like it was imprisoned in some cold run down place and establishment. His voice sounded so abused I started to tear up and I got all of that from a hello.  

 

I told the old man that I will buy him some coffee and when he was walking along side me I found an alley way where I stuffed his mouth with cloth from my pocket. I clothed his naked voice. Then as I got home I realized my own voice was naked.",1621121451.0
Run,2,0,"  

Run

You come to full awareness on your feet, running. Your footfalls echo down enigmatic passageways, the sound of your breathing reverberating in your ears as you flee from nothing to nowhere. All you can remember are damp walls passing by too quickly to discern any details and the feeling that, if you stop for even a second, you’re done for.

So, you continue, those walls, the floor, the ceiling, the light at the end of the tunnel, the darkness on your heels, and your breathing in time with your footsteps all so familiar as to almost induce déjà vu. But you block all of that out, your ears filling with white noise and static forming at the edges of your vision. 

It feels as if an eternity has passed when you finally reach the end, the light blinding, drowning out everything else. As you reach the end, you instinctively jump into the noiseless void of soft light, everything fading to nothing.

You awake to visceral darkness and an infernal hush as a deep, numb pain echoes through your body. 

You’ve stopped running. 

You aren’t moving anymore. 

To stop is to die and to die is to stop forever.

You hear loud footfalls and heavy breathing.

You feel a primal urge to chase that can’t be ignored.



You know that your meal won’t escape for long.",1621145879.0
Drawing Conclusions,54,6,"In my early teens my parents decided they had put their dreams on hold long enough. They sold our house, and soon I found myself touring the country in an enormous RV.

&#x200B;

The long rides between destinations left me with a lot of time to discover a talent I didn’t know I had. I filled hundreds of sketchbooks, capturing anything I thought was worth remembering. As I improved, the details became vivid, lifelike and precise.

&#x200B;

One summer my parents met a couple of kindred spirits in the RV park we were camped at. They had a daughter named Denise who I was immediately smitten with. I tried to work up the courage to talk to her for a few days, ultimately she was the one who approached me.

&#x200B;

I had gotten into the habit of carrying my sketchbooks with me everywhere, never knowing when inspiration might strike. One day I hiked a good ways from the camp to a spot that overlooked the lake, searching for the perfect vantage point. Immersed in my work, it took me a long time to realize Denise was standing there. When I finally looked up, I nearly jumped out of my skin.

&#x200B;

“I didn’t mean to scare you,” she apologized.

&#x200B;

“Well, you did, my heart almost burst!” I fumed. She looked down at the ground and I decided to soften my tone.

&#x200B;

“What are you doing here?”

&#x200B;

“You’re very talented. I was hoping you might draw something for me.”

&#x200B;

Denise had never seen anything I’d drawn before. In fact she had made a point of ignoring me until that day. And stalking me through the woods? Very strange. Nevertheless, I was curious.

&#x200B;

“What do you have in mind?” I asked, flipping to a fresh page. She came over and sat beside me, fixing her eyes on mine. For a while we sat in silence, then I realized my hand was drawing of its own accord. 

&#x200B;

I scratched away, unable to stop. I wanted to pull myself from her eyes, I wanted to pull my hand from the paper, but my body refused to cooperate with my brain. When it was finished all I could do was stare at it in shock.

&#x200B;

“Thank you,” she whispered, kissing my cheek. And then she walked away, disappearing through the trees and leaving me completely disoriented.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On my walk back to the campsite I was surprised to see police and forest ranger vehicles lining the dirt roads. As I approached one of the officers stopped me.

&#x200B;

“I’m going to take you to your family, we’ve just found a girl’s body in the lake.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn't long before the news broadcasts began, relaying Denise's horrific murder to the public. They always concluded with a sketch of the suspect and a hotline for leads.

&#x200B;

Sure, I lied about some things, but I owed it to Denise. 

&#x200B;

And I *had* seen her killer. His face was still crumpled up at the bottom of my backpack, bitterly torn from my sketchbook.",1621075622.0
Doing it for the ‘Gram,3,0,"We spent the better part of a day driving all over the Valley, taking artfully-constructed photographs in compelling locations. 

“Why are we doing this, man? I asked.

“We’re doing it for the ‘Gram,” was all they would tell me.

Instagram was all the rage in my peer group, and this answer made sense to me. These were some seriously righteous shots in front of iconic spots all over the valley. They kept asking me to take the pictures, which was cool. I didn’t mind being their photographer.

As the day wore on, we crested a hill for our 19th or 20th stop of the day. It was a small cottage near the outskirts of town. Standing outside was an elderly woman.

“Who is that?” I asked.

“What do you mean? That is my ‘Gram.”

As it turns out, ‘Gram was his grandmother and she wasn’t able to get out of the house due to poor health. We sat with her in a cozy dining room and showed her all of the shots. She smiled and said “that is very nice.”

When we had viewed all of these photographs, they asked me to stand next to ‘Gram for a photo, my first of the day. I was touched. I put my arm around her fragile shoulders and posed for the picture.

<SNAP>

I didn’t notice them come up behind us and snap ‘Gram’s neck. She now laid lifeless on the ground next to us.

The Last Night,5,4,"It was late on a Friday night and Cindy was headed home after she finished studying in the library.
She always took the same route home and, even though it was dark, she wasn't nervous or scared. The wind tousled her curly locks and made her hair ribbon blow in the breeze. Some people thought, at 18, she was too old for ribbons, but she liked them. 

She was about half way home when she heard footsteps behind her. She threw a curious glance over her shoulder and saw a tall figure made into a silhouette by the street lamp behind. He was several yards back, but she knew up close he'd tower over her 5'4 frame. 

As Cindy kept walking the footsteps remained steady behind her. She picked up her pace a tiny bit as her mind began to come up with gruesome situations. 

A knife slicing through the air 

Blood spurting onto the pavement 

A brick smashing down on a head 

A dead body laying on the pavement 

She shook her head to clear the thoughts and focused on listening to the footsteps behind her. They sounded closer now so she picked up her pace again. 

Her heart started beating faster, keeping pace with her feet as she almost started jogging. She thought she heard the footsteps speed up behind her too. 

There was a recessed shop doorway just ahead and as she reached it she dodged sideways into it. Cindy hoped that the gap between the streetlights gave her enough cover of darkness that the silhouette didn't see her. 

Cindy hid in that doorway for what seemed like eternity. She tried to keep her breathing steady as adrenaline coursed through her veins, she'd need to be able to catch her breath once the shadowy figure got there. 

Eventually they showed up. But they didn't pause at the doorway or even give Cindy the impression that he was looking for her. 

Perfect 


As the figure continued down the road Cindy could see he was a well built man dressed in running gear, sweat pouring down his back, and although she couldn't see it, probably his face too. 

She quietly crept out from her hiding place and continued down the road, behind the man. Before long he slowed to a walk again and Cindy could hear him panting. 

Now was her chance, she half walked half ran silently towards the slowed, panting man. And she approached him she drew out a Bowie knife, she streetlights glinted off the shiny blade and she plunged it deep into the side of his neck, severing his artery. 

Blood spurted onto the pavement 

Nearby there was a garden wall under construction. 

Cindy grabbed a brick and brought it down on the man's head, once, twice, three times. 

Cindy stood up and resumed her walk home.

Bye bye misery,1,2,"I woke up this morning, feeling nothing for the first time in my life. Finally I got the peace I asked for. Life is going on without me and I like it. Although some might think I’m dead, I’m not exactly, my heart is still beating strong. I find it a good reminder that I’m still alive and human. At least I think. Well I guess the doubt is the price you pay for selling your soul instead of jumping off a bridge. It’s fine, I like it. That way I won’t get hurt... but now that my pain was taken away, it’s gonna be passed on. I wonder who?

Jeffrey the Juggler,28,4,"We were messing around, like all boys do, up in the attic of my house, when we found the clown-suit. It was slightly faded, slightly tattered and torn, but the red wig, the red nose was cherry-red, and it was so bright it jumped out at us.

Jeffrey put on the clown-suit. “How do I look?” he grinned.

“Great!” I replied.

Then he squeezed his eyes shut. Without a word, he turned and left the attic.

I found him in the kitchen a few minutes later, juggling knives. The knives spun in a perfect circle, landing neatly in his hands each time.

“Wow,” I said. “Where did you learn to do that, Jeffrey?”

Jeffrey didn’t seem to answer me. I looked at him closely and realised that his eyes were closed. Like he was sleep-juggling. Either that, or he was doing it on purpose, to make it seem more impressive.

“Jeffrey?” I said. “Can you hear me?”

Nothing

When I came down the next day, Jeffrey was still in his corner, juggling. His parents had called. Jeffrey had not come home. I said Jeffrey was still at my house. They said they would be over immediately.

They arrived to find Jeffrey still juggling knives. They yelled at him to stop, but he did not respond. So I tried tapping his shoulder and pulling his costume off, hoping it would make him stop. But the costume seemed to have melted into him. The bright red hair was now his hair; the bright red nose now his nose.

Then Jeffrey suddenly stopped juggling. He caught his knives and looked at me. There was nothing in his eyes. I wonder how he felt when he realised I had disrupted his concentration. Anger, perhaps? Or maybe he was still feeling under the weather from the effects of the clown-suit.

I wish we had never found it.

Then without warning, the knives came sailing through the air. They were thrown with perfect accuracy and precision, and they were meant to kill.

One for his father. He dropped to the floor instantly, the knife in his heart in a bullseye, the blood pooling around him and staining the kitchen floor.

One for the mother. She did not scream as she dropped.

And one for me.

I dodged mine just in time and watched as Jeffrey pulled more knives out of the kitchen drawer and started juggling them again. Then he raced out of the kitchen door.

Moments later I heard screams all the way from my house.

I never saw Jeffrey again. Nor do I think he ever took off that clown-suit. Therefore, if you see a boy wearing a clown-suit and running towards you with knives and his eyes closed, know it is too late.",1621079289.0
I Die First,30,7,"The words stuck with me as I sat shaking in the living room, my ears straining to differentiate between the noises of the chaos.

*I die first.*

We'd been discussing the concept of death as Ellie's friend's mum had unexpectedly passed away. Ellie was seven at this point so I was trying to be truthful and yet ever so gentle. It was at the point in the conversation where I explained to her that all parents die eventually and that even I would one day that she uttered those chilling words:

""I know that mummy. But I die first.""

From most children this sentence would have been chilling but from Ellie it felt startlingly accurate. She said things sometimes that turned out to be true. Things she couldn't know and things that I couldn't stop. Of course, she also sometimes just came out with random nonsense simply because she was a child, it was hard to tell. And as I had no way of knowing if what she said would turn out to be true it just stuck there like a splinter in my heart.

*I die first.*

She got older and eventually she began to mature. The predictions slowed whilst the nonsense faded away almost entirely. We navigated new challenges together as she teetered on the edge of true childhood and then stepped into teenagerdom. I never once asked her about that fatal prediction, happier to hope for the best than be confronted by the worst.

*I die first.*

She was fourteen when it happened. The plague spread so quickly we only had hours between it being a conspiracy theory that some people suspected and total, world ending chaos. Nobody on the emergency news broadcast said the word that all survivors were thinking. Nobody even said the words 'bite' or 'dead.' It was clunky sounding sentences such as 'transmission when saliva interacts with the bloodstream' and 'carriers possess abnormal endurance even after near total loss of brain function.'

*I die first.*

Ellie had been out with friends that day. I tried to call her but the phones were dead. I had no way to find her. It would have been a hopeless mission anyway, an unarmed woman wading alone into a city of infected, but I didn't even know where she was. She was old enough to be given some freedom, I'd reasoned. She'd earned a certain amount of independence.

*I die first.*

Those words that have eaten away at a small part of me for so long are now doing so much worse. I know that my daughter is dead, you understand. And whilst that has broken my heart, knowing she died doesn't scare me. But as I sit here and mourn in silence those words scare me now because they are no longer enough.

My daughter told me that she'd die first. But she never told me if she'd stay dead.",1621075505.0
The Simple Truth of Zombification,16,1," 

In stories there’s always an exciting cause for turning into a zombie. A bite, a virus... none of them are as lame as “it strikes you suddenly.” But real life is not known for its adherence to the dramatic artistry of fiction, so here we are, stuck with the simple truth of zombification striking suddenly.

In the stories it’s a slow decay of the body. A person, rotting alive, propelled by the baser, remaining parts of their brain. That’s not how it is in real life either.

In real life, you could be minding your business. It occurs then—a vivid whirl of images, the colors brighter than anything you’ve ever seen. Most of the time the visions are indistinguishable, the subjects beyond comprehension, but they’re unmistakable. You’ll know, for sure, that you’ve become a zombie once you see them.

The “becoming” is actually a “crossing over.” The first visions mark the moment your soul tries to leave this dimension. But since your body remains anchored, it feels like the very crux of your existence is being stretched apart. You feel like you are going to snap into two at any moment and the pain of it is indescribable—it is raging fire and creeping ice and it is falling and drowning and getting punched in the belly—and it follows you, incessantly, day after day, hour after hour, minute after minute. At this point you should be grateful that you’ve lost the mortal compulsions to eat and sleep because you would have been unable to otherwise. It’s the most you can do to drag yourself along, moaning in agony. 

After you eat your first brain it gets better. There’s something about the constitution of human brains that’s enough to start severing the tie between your soul and your body.

But in return for that you start slipping further from this world. You’ll have visions more frequently—at some point you’ll be able to recognize the figures even as the words for them escape you. Reality becomes disjointed, and getting your hands on brains is much, much harder now. Perhaps you could trick a fledgling zombie into sharing with you, but they’ll catch on soon. It’s a race to the finish line, everyone fighting to make their getaway into the next world. Then the pain will be gone, and you’ll be okay. You’ll have a new life, you’ll be a different being, and all of it will be a distant dream. 

Yes, you’ll forget all of it. Your wife—her look of terror, her pooling blood, her nerve fibers unspooling between your teeth. Then your children, the toddler, the baby, in tidy succession. Even when you began drifting harder, when you could even see an alien face peering back at you in the hallucinatory gloom, you could never quite let go of the screams of your family. But you will soon—all of this will be put behind you. All it’ll take is some extra patience and dedication. But you can do that, can’t you?",1621085873.0
You did this!,52,3,"I walk down aisle nine. There’s a young boy stocking the shelves. He turns to me.

“You did this!” he says, keeping his gaze on me as I reach for the packet of beef jerky.

I ignore him and head to the checkout. The cashier ringing me up is the same boy from earlier. He scans my items, but his eyes remain fixated on me.

“You did this!” he shouts.

I load my groceries into the back of the car, but I keep the jerky with me. After turning on the ignition and pulling out of the spot, I slowly drive past the row of cars. I’m struggling to open the jerky bag, so I tear into it with my teeth. The jerky goes flying and for just a second, I take my eyes off the road. 

The car rumbles, jumping up and down. *Crunch.* I slam on the breaks and step out of the car. The same boy from inside the store is lodged under the front tire wheel. His head has been pressed inwards like a deflated football. He manages to free himself and stand up, blood pouring out from his face.

“You did this! You did this! You did this!” he says to me over and over.

“Pause it,” the Doctor says to me.

My normal vision returns, and I am brought back to reality with my consultation with the Doctor assigned for my sentencing. 

“As you know Judy, you have been sentenced to thirty-six years of confinement. The boy’s family has elected to have you enrolled in the loop playback initiative. Rather than putting you in prison for life, you are granted a shorter sentence, however, you will be required to watch the final ten minutes of that boy’s life for three hours a day,” the Doctor says to me. “Do you understand?”

I nod.

“We hope that this will help you feel a sense of remorse for taking an innocent boy’s life. When you are released, your life will never be the same. With the recent advancements in technology, every living person you see will look just like that boy.” The Doctor glances at his watch. “We’re finished here. Good luck Judy. Stay strong.”

I’m transported back to those final ten minutes of freedom.",1621060054.0
The Plate,6,2,"I started my new job at a food distribution company. I was picking a skid in one of our coolers and saw a place my trainer didn't tell me about. It was back in the corner of this cooler room. There was a metal plate where a concrete floor should be. It was about 2 by 1 meters. I couldn't lift it myself. Curiosity got the better of me and I laid down. This was to check if I could see under the metal plate. I couldn't see under it but I heard some stuff coming from underneath the floor. The sounds were very hard to hear. It sounded like someone talking to another person. I checked again on a different day when I saw a faint violet light peeking out. There was people talking like last time. But when I got close, the talking stopped. I got freaked out by this and didn't go near that spot for a few months. I was scared but I went near it again. The same coloured light was there like last time as well as the voices. This felt different. There was an itch inside me telling to get away, a feeling of wrongness. I started to go away when the plate swung up and a strange being looked out at me. It had to be almost 2.5 meters tall with weird looking skin, blades on its head, hands, and ankles. There were red cloths tied on its arms where I would assume its biceps were. When it spoke, it was a rustling sound almost like tree branches brushing against each other in the wind. It stepped completely out of the hole. It called back down in that rustling language. A human woman that was tan with dark hair and eyes came out. She looked at me and said, ""You have tenacity. Checking out something that is disturbing and avoided by most humans in this place. You'll do nicely."" She nodded at the scaly creature and it took me down into the depths, my screams and cries unheard by another employee. The coworkers I had befriended never knew what happened to me but when they asked about it, our supervisor told them, ""They moved away from here to the south.""",1621099687.0

I will take the south western flank and  take a LMG with me. Kishore will be with be on S-W flank.Ram singh on S flank. And 4 LMGs will be put on west flank.

section : Yes sir!

Cap: plan is clear. We start firing at my command. SW flank would fire first if not told otherwise. It’s behind the slop and gets natural barrier of mountain. For artillery , mortars would fire in synchronisation between S-W and S flank. AAG would fire for air attack , mostly anticipated from the S flank. Clear?

Welcome to The Library. This is the world's largest storehouse of knowledge regarding mind, consciousness and the body. Thank you for joining us, and for welcoming us into your mindspace. I am your host for this reading session, and I will introduce you to the basic rule you are expected to follow while using our service. Please keep in mind that not following the rule will, at the very least, result in expulsion from The Library. The consequences of the choices made here carry forward into the outside world, and the onus of preventing this is on you. However, there is no cause for worry: you are safe as long as you abide by the rule stated below. While you are reading this, you may refer to me as the Reverend.

The rule is simple. Seeing as The Library is a digital archive of forgotten documents, many of which hold enormous value and power, you are forbidden from copy-pasting or downloading material. Ownership is power. You may write words down. Note that this requires effort and imbues the words with your energy, lending them credence and power. Kindly exercise discretion before copying Old or Ancient text or symbols - here, everything has meaning. The Library will not be held responsible for your lack of caution if you manifest an Ancient Beast by accident because you got distracted and/or doodled the Summoning.

If you are unwary and give permissions to Entities whilst communicating with them, I cannot intervene or interrupt the contract. That is outside my jurisdiction. 

Information is being processed as I speak - please wait.

If you cannot hear me in your head, there is likely another entity already residing there that is blocking my voice. I cannot protect you.

Last Hope,8,1,"The guru, seated alone in his mountaintop retreat, concentrated more valiantly than ever. He had felt the last of his cadres, the penultimate member of what once had been an august force, depart his body only minutes before. Now he, and he alone, had to hold it together. To shape the possibilities.

The world at large was recovering from the pandemic. Lockdowns were ending, quarantines were easing, and countries had begun to open up for business. Millions had died, but multitudes had survived. Although shaken by the experience, people everywhere were ready to begin living again. They cautiously tried to learn to enjoy life again, as they had before.

And the guru, and his worldwide esoteric cadre, had hermetically focused their attention together, tugging at the higher-dimensional probabilities that controlled which of many outcomes actually happened. Chaos theory taught that the beating of a butterfly's wings could cause hurricanes on the other side of the world, but not how to help or hinder it. But the guru, and others like him, had direct knowledge of the shaping of such causes.

At first, he thought he was the only one. But as time passed, enigmatic feelings and impressions traveled over the inscrutable terrain of their cabalistic realm, and they combined their efforts, increasing their power. Without them, the odds were insurmountable that humanity would be cut down to tens of thousands in only two months, their centuries of effort and sacrifice all for naught. As ill-behaved as they all were, the guru and his incognito confederacy couldn't let them die out; it would set the cause of Terran enlightenment back millions of years. He shuddered at the thought of waiting until cockroaches had evolved to sentience before trying again.

Slowly he realized that he couldn't stop shuddering. His body was failing! Panic flooded his mind, and he lost his focus. No, not now, not when mankind was close to triumph in this crucible! He tried desperately to find his center; it swung around wildly, like an untamed animal, worse than when he had started these meditation exercises, so many lifetimes ago. His mind clawed at its darting form, but to no avail. He felt his energy drain away. How much of the recovery was stable? How much depended on his concentration? Soon his consciousness had fallen to the point where he could no longer consider the question.

Even in the largest cities, plants had made giant strides in reclaiming the artificial works of man. Lichens and fungi had led the way; vines wrapped around the buildings, and small trees split apart the concrete as they reached for the sky. Predators hunted prey, darting among the ruins of human civilization.

An aboriginal tribe, living in balance with their surroundings, wondered where the giant birds had gone, the ones that flew without flapping their wings. A great conference of nearby tribes was called, and the bravest warriors had been selected to venture out of their isolation, to explore the outside world, for answers.",1621079400.0
The Monster Among Us,15,1,"Jackie, the transfer student, sat on the 5th seat of the front row because he felt that not seeing the students will help him ignore them. His enhanced senses though weren't helpful because he heard every whisper, every crawling sweat, and every heightened heartbeat from everyone in the room. The one that broke him was the teacher's reaction when she saw him. He thought she’ll be the one who’ll be comfortable around him. He would've forgiven the gasp, but the teacher stayed just beside the door as close to it as possible because you know, just in case he might go into an eating spree.  


""Children, meet Jackie McHungry, your new classmate."" The teacher said with a roughness in her voice.  


Jackie stood up exposing his long and pointy claws and smiled with its shark-like teeth in front of everyone.   


""Hello everyone. I'm happy to be here and I'm excited to learn new stuff with all of you!"" Jackie's deep and rugged voice was greeted with silence.  


""Jackie, I'm sorry to say this but we don't allow nails that are that long. Please cut them to a reasonable length."" Jackie sensed that she was trying to hold back what she's saying. ""Thank you. I hope you will be pleased with your stay here in Baguhan Elementary School. You can now sit down. Class, turn to page 42 and I'll be right back.""  


As the teacher left, the student to his left moved her chair and table near him. Jackie was confused. She then took out a book from her bag and turned it to page 42.   


""We are now on this paragraph."" The student said.  


Jackie grunted, vapor came out of his nose.  


""Here, I'll read it aloud for you.""  


The name printed on the student's ID says ""Jessica"" and this is Jackie's first time experiencing some kind of bond with a human. Eventually, both of them would eat together during recess as people's eyes stared at them. Together they parted seas of students on the busy hallways. The once lively gymnasium was now an empty building with the two's laughter bounced off of its cemented walls. Despite the fear towards him, today is shaping up to be a very good one, Jackie may have thought. The day then ended with a wave of goodbyes from each other.   


""Thank you for being the source of my strength!"" Jackie roared as the sunset was being reflected on his smile.  


""Don't forget about homework!"" Jessica said.  


""I won't!""  


Tomorrow came and Jackie had a feeling that the second day of school is going to be a fresh start. He made sure that his nails are now short. He now knows the ins and outs of the school infrastructure. He also even know about some students' and teachers' names. While he needs to make some changes with last night's homework, overall he was thankful for Jessica's idea.  


""If you want to be like us, I think the first step is to learn about the planet you're stepping on right now. Know the humans. Know how humans function. Have a map of the school in your mind. Know our city. Here, I’ll write a study guide for you and we’ll review it tomorrow.” Jessica told him yesterday. “This will help you to be more human, well, not that you need to be a human. I think you're perfectly fine to someone's eyes like mine.""  


Jackie got into the classroom, but just like the reactions outside and even the hallways, he didn't get any. He sat on the 4th seat of the front row. A few minutes later, the teacher came in and started doing a roll-call.

Radio Silence,56,6,"I fiddled with the knobs, pressed buttons, plugged and unplugged cables. It was out there—that *thing*. God, I hoped there was only one. The manuals were in Russian, if they *were* manuals at all. I had taken two hours of an online language course before the trip. ‘*Speh-see-buh*, thank you. *Doh-bray Vee-yech-uh*, good evening.’  Not much use in tuning frequencies on a Soviet-era radio communications array. 

We had been watering the sled dogs when my daughter, Sofia, saw a stray cat run across the tundra and past a thicket of wiry shrubs. “Is fine.” Grigori had said as she took off after it. She loves little animals. Always has. 

Grigori knew the frozen wilds much better than I could ever hope to. He was a hard man. “Will run faster than her. In less than minute, she will be—.  The *thing* was so fast I could only see a blur and Grigori, the hard man, was reduced to a blanket of red atop the snow. The lead dog was next. 

I was heaving clouds of icy breath by the time I made it to the bunker and shut the heavy latch behind me. “Listening stations.” Grigori had said of the multitude of squat concrete boxes we passed. “From Cold War.”

Well, I was listening. The speaker cooed and crackled. “Sofia? Sofia?”

“I’m lost...”

“Sofia! Sweetie, thank god you’re okay! You—you found a listening station? That’s my smart girl.”

“Yes...Okay. Daddy I...but I found a building. I’m…”

The choppy reception made communication slow, but at least she was safe. Inside. Away from that thing. 

“Sofia, I’m having a little trouble hearing you. Can you hear me?”

“I hit the...but...sound...scratchy...It might...going.”

“Oh, no, sweetie don’t hit anything. The scratchy reception—it’s just static okay?  Let’s just keep talking.”

I heard a bump against the door to the outside, soft at first, but the second was forceful enough to rattle the latch with a bassy *clunk.* I trembled, watching my breath escape my lips in shaky puffs. 

“Sofia...honey.”  I didn’t know what to tell her. 

*CLANK.*

“Scared. I’m...circle...I think...ere are you?”

I tried to puzzle through her words.  *Circle?*  A gasp caught in my throat. 

“No, Sofia! Don’t go outside! I know you’re scared, but stay in.  Don’t look for daddy, okay?”

I heard the thing scraping against the metal of the door. Horrible, grating scratches. 

“Sofia?...Sofia?”

The scratching was getting faster, punctuated by *thuds* and *clangs*.

I frantically turned dials and toggled switches, listening to the pops, whirs and hisses. And then I heard Sofia clearly:

*I hit the button with the circle for record I think. Yes, record, I remember. Okay. Daddy I got lost but I found a building. I’m here, but where are you?*

*Oh, wait. There’s a sound, kind of scratchy, at the door. It might be another kitty. It sounds...scared. I’m going to let it in.*

Her recording had been playing on repeat.

Rejuvenation Destroyed My Family.,26,7," Death has always been the primary fear of man, and its greatest ally is time. Given enough time, everything will die. Trees die, people die, planets die, beliefs die, and even gods will die. There is an argument to be made that man has been in an endless pursuit of godhood, which could be another reason why we sought to be immortal. However, its up to you to decide which is the better motivator, fear or greed.   


The lazarus solution gave those who could afford it a second chance. It rejuvenated you, depending on the amount you took.

They adopted the name of mortal and Mortalism took hold in the holdouts.   


My mother bought into Laz. She went from being a 45 year old woman to 23 in a day. Her grey hairs were gone, the wrinkles on her face disappeared, and her arthritis was nonexistent. She was incredibly happy. Happier than I've ever seen her. I was 14 when she started taking Laz, and I was 16 when my mother got pregnant. One of the reasons my Mother started taking Laz was to try and relive the glory days. The days where men couldn't take their eyes off of her. The days when she was treated like a goddess.   


I don't remember much about my mother after that. I moved out of the house when I was 18 and never looked back. When I was around 20 I had heard from my Uncle that my mother had all of her children taken away from her. This was the first time I learned that I had 4 siblings. I decided then and there that I would go and see if I could take them home. Better for them to be with me than in an orphanage.   


Although I didn't care much about what happened to my mother, my Uncle told me what happened. She had apparently suffered from a new addiction. She wanted to be a child, but everyone knows that Laz does not reverse time, it simply rejuvenates you to your youngest self. Basically you would still be fully grown, but have cells that would appear to be fresh out of the womb. So those who wanted to be children had undergone radical illegal transplant surgeries. My mother was one of them.   


Before I went to CPS, I went to the prison where she was being held on child abuse charges. As I sat across from her, a small chrysalis of what she once was, I asked her only one question.   


""I can see why you chose this one Ma."", I shook my head, ""So, I take it that this body was supposed to be my little sister?""",1621040689.0
Some Notes To Help Cope,17,1,"DD/MM/YY

&#x200B;

I've been hearing thumps from her room. She's awake again. The last dosage may have been too much; she hasn't been active for the last two days. 

&#x200B;

\- 

&#x200B;

She's moving again now. She can make it to the kitchen and back on her own. I usually avoid that general area when she does this, I hate the low, despairing sound her throat makes when she eats. 

&#x200B;

\- 

&#x200B;

She tried talking to me today. For two minutes I had to look at her grotesque, scarred face as she tried to form words- something about a baby? Each time she opened her mouth, I had to smell the stomach acid wafting out. She isn't still her. She isn't still my Zetta. 

&#x200B;

\-

&#x200B;

She can say my name now. I hate it. She says it all the time. I can't get any sleep now, by the way. I'm afraid she might sneak in and try to cuddle like we used to. When she was normal. 

&#x200B;

\- 

&#x200B;

I tried giving her more of the medicine than what she's supposed to have. I was secretly hoping it would be lethal. It wasn't. Instead of dying, she just lay on the kitchen floor, screaming. 

&#x200B;

\- 

&#x200B;

She tries to hang out with me now, and I can't say no. I'm afraid of what she'll do if I say no. She thinks everything's still normal with us- if you can imagine. I can't really blame her for thinking that, there are no reflective surfaces in the house. She can't look at herself. 

&#x200B;

\- 

&#x200B;

She's asleep again. You'd think I'd take the opportunity to escape, I can't. They're out there, watching, making sure I don't try to escape. ""You're doing a favour to humanity, keeping it there,"" humanity can screw off. What about me? Do they think I like being kept here? That I like pretending that this monster is my Zetta?

I haven't heard anything from her room. Every time I pass her door, I smell death. Still can't sleep, by the way. I can't. I'm always thinking of when the babies will burst out of her chest. Then I'll have to look after more like her. At least twenty.",1621046822.0
Can't help falling,24,11," ""I love you"" I mouthed silently.

He just nodded. I was always afraid it would end like this, but I'm not really surprised.

Still though, it hurts. He's a good man, and from the moment I met him I had a feeling we'd be good together. He made some low-brow joke about clogs and Danish toilets, and I thought ""I like him, we're going to work""... 

And we did! For a long time we were good together. Maybe I'm biased, but I really thought we were the perfect team. I'm driven, optimistic, and creative; he's more.. practical. Down-to-earth, you know? Have you ever met that guy, he rarely talks but when he does everyone shuts up because it must be important? That's him. And he always does the right thing. He's one of the few people in the world I admire. 

It's been... 3ish years? Something like that. Some people in our position get tired of each other, but not us. Every challenge brought us closer, every problem, solved together. We kicked ass and took names, all that stuff. They always say communication is key and that's true. I can tell you from experience; open, clear, to-the-point communication is what made us work. I really wish life hadn't brought us to this point. But, if you take away anything it's to always, **always** communicate. If you fail to communicate, you end up like this. 

I feel bad for his wife and kids though, I won't lie. He's their whole world and I don't know what they'll do without him. But we play the hands we're dealt, nothing to be done about it now. Plus, I know they'll be ok; his wife is smart and strong and his kids are resilient. I mean, they have to be... given his line of work.

I looked over to our third. Young kid. I don't know much about him except he's cool as a cucumber. Unnervingly cool. Even then, he was staring out the window, in a different world.

*click, click* on the mic, a signal I made out of habit. 

Well, habit and fear I guess; fear that silence would drown out my words. When noise is the norm, it becomes comforting. The hum of engines, the *bwopbwopbwop* of rotor blades, even the occasional gunfire. Without it, the silence is heavy and it sits on your chest and it crushes your soul. If I spoke into that silence I would vomit from fear. 

*click click* He turned to us.

""I love you"" I mouthed again. 3 nods. Just like we practiced. 

       ""I love you Sam""

       ""I love you Melissa, Janey, Jordan, Sophia""

       ""I love you mom""

There it is. The last pieces of ourselves poured into a black box for safe keeping, while we keep an appointment with the ground. And here it comes now...",1621036894.0
The Facetime Lady,26,5,"It was the first day of summer, my two friends and I wanted to do a sleepover as a celebration of the first day of summer. It was really fun, we played board games, ate pizza, and did prank calls. It was around 1:30 when my friends and I started getting bored, so one of my friends, Cynthia, asked us if we wanted to play ''The Facetime Lady''.

We both asked her what ''The Facetime Lady'' was, she explained us the rules of the game, we needed to close all the lights of the house, lit three candles around the laptop, then we needed to go on a website called ''Facetime Me'' and then we needed to type the number ''090870'' into the search bar.

We agreed to play the game, and did as the rules told us to. My other friend and I were really scared to play the game, at first I thought the game was fake, but then when Cynthia typed the number into the search bar, it started ringing.

Suddenly, a woman appeared on the screen, she was thin, pale and looked like she hadn't slept for weeks, her teeth were yellow and her clothes looked like they were torn apart badly. She didn't say anything she just kept staring at us with a straight face.

 All of a sudden, she started making clicking noises, a sick smile appeared on her face, her eyes widened, and as the minutes went by, the clicking noises became louder and louder, she typed something into the chat, it was a link, I told Cynthia not to click the link, but her curiosity got the best of her, what happened next terrified me.

The link showed a video of my friend's house, a woman was standing on the doorstep, knocking slowly, we all froze, the woman was no longer facetiming us. We all instantly knew that it was the facetime lady. All of a sudden, the candles went out and the house was dark.

We heard the main door open, Cynthia started running upstairs and my other friend and I started running upstairs as well, we hid under her bed trying not to make a sound, Cynthia was crying, I told her to keep quiet or else the lady would find us.

We hid under the bed for what felt like hours, I really wanted to go home, so I told my friends that I was gonna go home. They warned me to be careful, I promised them that I would be safe. I tip toed my way downstairs, watching my every move.

I didn't see anyone downstairs, I thought I was safe. I was about to walk out of the house, but then I heard a noise behind me.

Revenge of the Vending Machine,1195,59,"“Stop being such a sissy, Danny,” teased my brother Jessie. “Just shake it a little.”

Something about the machine bothered me. Ever since we hopped out of mom and dad’s car at the rest stop and headed to the area marked ‘Vending’, I’d felt like it was watching me.

It cast a sinister aura. I’m not sure if it was the indecipherable graffiti sprayed around its perimeter or the strangely antiquated appearance of its spartan supply of snacks.

The top row was empty aside from two bags of potato chips marked “GUARANTEED FRESH UNTIL 1/1/1999” and a half-melted oatmeal cream pie that drooped over the metal spiral holding it in place.

“I dunno, Jessie,” I murmured. “The food looks disgusting anyway.”

“Out of my way, twerp,” retorted Jessie, pushing me aside. As I tumbled into the concrete wall, he gripped the machine and shoved.

It was heavy, and at first it didn’t budge. But, finally, Jessie managed to lift its front legs. When they crashed down again, Jessie’s prize came loose from the bottom row.

“Gotcha!” he exclaimed. With a satisfied smile, he reached into the pickup box. The treat he removed read, *Clarissa’s Jumbo Glazed Honey Bun*.

As we departed, a metallic sound, like the clank of metal against a hard surface, drew my attention back to the machine. Somehow, it looked like it had…moved, if only by a few inches. 

“You sure you don’t want any?” asked Jessie as we sat in our hotel room that evening. Our parents had left us alone while visiting the bar.

“Yeah.”

“Good, because I wouldn’t have shared it anyway, idiot,” mumbled Jessie as he took another bite of the gooey pastry. As he chewed, he seemingly took no notice of its strangely stringy texture. “This is *so* good. And it didn’t cost me a dime. Too bad you were too chicken to get it.”

A deep, blunt sound boomed against the door to the hallway.

“Who do you think it is?” I asked Jessie.

“Who do you think, moron? Mom and dad must have forgotten their key.” He hopped off the bed and headed to the door.

“You should look before opening it!” I called.

“*I’m Danny, I’m scared of everything*,” he mocked as he swung the door open. “**What?**” he gasped upon finding himself face-to-face with the vending machine, which wedged its way into the room.

I covered my eyes as Jessie’s screams faded. When I finally peeked, I saw his foot sticking out of the pickup box. With a ‘slurp’ sound, it, too, was sucked inside.

My parents later found me unconcious. Of course, no autonomous vending machine was located and no one believed my story. Jessie’s disappearance went unsolved.

Years later, I find myself at a familiar rest stop. I chill runs down my spine as I creep into the vending area and towards a machine covered in graffiti. The label on one of the pastries on its bottom row reads, *Jessie’s Jumbo Glazed Honey Bun*.",1620956178.0
Camera phone and Telly hosts,4,1," 

""hi welcome to wheel, of, fortune, everyone's favorite trivia game show, today we have a few special guests""

the tape starts playing in reverse again, skipping back until it gets to the theme song again, slowed down and played in reverse it's chilling

As you hide behind your mattress trying to avoid the beast coming through your mirror only seen through your camera phone, you quickly look at the telly again and see the host of the show walking forwards as time around him moves backwards.

as the beast approaches your bed you take out your phone and whisper into it, “Alexa, turn the lights off” the lights dim enough that you can no longer see the beast through your phone, the mirror isn’t seen in the darkness, you’re safe, or at least you think you are. however you’re too terrified to move, joining that Séance with Patricia and Cody wan a mistake your still in the discord call with them but you can only see Cody’s pure white background at this point, as you grip your comforter to your face still crying you realize the danger you’re still in, the guide said that the ritual would bring monsters to the realm, you had thought at the time it was their accent stressing the ‘s’ at the end there but you now realize how intentional their speech was, there are more, but if you turn the light back on the mirror creature will kill you.

the tape starts playing again and out of the corner of your eye you see it flash white as the title card plays giving enough light for the creature to appear and tear at the mattress you can hardly see the back of it through your phone as a hole is torn in the mattress the near invisible creature close enough to kill you, so in a panic you throw your phone at the telly breaking both it and your phone leaving you near dead in the dark and praying that no lights come on while you make your way to the mirror and lay it to the floor.

as you make your way to the phone you see Patty come back online her face bloodied and an eye gouged out you can't do anything as hands reach through the tv behind her, and as she opens her mouth to scream something you just stare as her head is pulled back, the same second yours is unable to do anything but stare at your friend in the call you continue to cry as both of your necks are dug into by the unseen beasts.",1621065981.0
The Other Side,20,1,"When the Gate opened in the Atlantic the world came to a standstill.

Almost overnight the petty politics and bickering between countries and even just regular people seemed completely inconsequential. 

Physicists, mathematicians, philosophers, government heads and even religious leaders all weighed in on what they thought it could mean. Although there were a number of disagreements, bonds were formed and treaties were made.

United research teams went to the Gate as the world watched. 

It was determined to be a form of energy doorway. A path that seemed to lead to another world. 

The bravest volunteers from across the globes military suited up and went in. Their reports were incredible. 

A resource rich world completely unspoiled with peaceful primitive natives. The atmosphere was habitable and their Gate much the same as ours opened in a vast body of water.

There was no debate on what came next.

Armies were rallied and anyone who could find a boat set off for the Gate.

We had bled our world dry hundreds of years ago. We ruined our air and destroyed our forests. We limped along as horrific storms ravaged the land and polluted water killed our creatures.

It wasn’t our fault that these people hadn’t figured out how to harness the power in their planet yet. Maybe if enough survive we can teach them.

I am sure we will do better a second time around.",1621031625.0
Peripheral Vision,15,1,"I know it’s there. I feel its gaze and the shadow its presence casts over me. But every time I look at it, I see nothing. And yet, I can’t look away.

Have you ever looked at someone’s eyes in a very dark room, trying to figure out if they were closed, and not been able to tell? 

Parents know this phenomenon. You can’t observe a baby’s eyes directly to see if they’re closed. The centre of our eyes see colour and need more light, where the edges see black and white and need less light. You have to look at something else, like their forehead, and allow your peripheral vision to paint the picture. 

I first saw it two nights ago, though I didn’t really *see* it. I caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye, a dark mass at the edge of my vision. When I looked straight at it, I didn’t see anything. I thought it was my imagination. I was wrong.

I woke later with a jolt, my heart hammering my ribs. I ran to the window and looked outside to see a dark stain on my grass, like someone dropped a water balloon from a balcony.

In the morning I learned this stain used to be a rabbit. The cops blamed it on coyotes. They say it’s mating season, and the nearby forest is part of their known territory. 

You tell me the last time a coyote exploded a rabbit and left nothing behind.

I passed by my back door a few more times with the same result. And each time I “saw” it, it was closer, until it was standing right outside. Up close it seemed even bigger, like an oversized dog. I still could only make out a black mass, a void in space with no discernible features.

As long as I kept looking at it directly, it couldn’t move. 

I backed away slowly while maintaining eye contact, hoping to walk backward up the stairs and hide long enough to call for help. The second I got around the corner and broke line of sight I heard glass shatter, followed by heavy deliberate thuds barreling toward me. They stopped the second they reached the corner.

I repeated this until I got to the bathroom. I sit here, staring down the hallway to the stairs with nothing separating me from whatever godforsaken creature is standing there. I have to maintain eye contact. Every time I blink, I can feel it inching closer. I can hear its raspy breaths now.

The police didn’t believe me when I called, so I blindly hit apps on my phone until I could send a message using text-to-speech. Please, whoever can see this, get help.

It’s been 24 hours, it’s getting closer, and my eyes are getting tired.",1621033094.0
Let It Go,14,2,"“Marian, would you like to tell me what happened?”

“Oh yes, it was just the most wonderful day.  The sun was shining, and I was to meet my friends in the garden after my daily chores.  I had not seen my friends as much of late.  There’s always so much to do, it seems, especially with the baby bird I am taking care of now.”

“Life tends to get busy, doesn’t it?  What then?”

“I was on my way to see my friends at the water garden, and my mind fell to The White Prince.  Why he’s just so handsome and kind, gentle.  I wished to see him so strongly, so I changed my course to go to him.  I knew he would appreciate it since there was so much distance from each other lately.”

“And did you find him?  The White Prince?”

“Yes, but he wasn’t alone, as I had expected.”

“Who was with him?”

“A forest nymph who lives nearby.  They were dancing.  That’s when I brought out the horn of truth.”

“Did they stop dancing?”

“The nymph wove a crown of red poppies and disappeared in the mist.  My sweet prince bowed to me and held my hands as I blew into the horn once more, and then he became The Silent Prince.  Then I found the baby bird asleep in his nest.  What happened next was so strange…”

“How so?”

“Well I clasped him to my heart and his little wings beat so fiercely against my chest for a moment.  Then they stopped and I lifted him up and he flew off into the sky.  He was so beautiful, and I waved and cried as he went.  I wandered into a clearing and sat down.  A moment later a woodcutter came by on a steed and took me away here.”

“Thank you, Marian.  You rest now and we will talk soon, ok?”

“May I ask one question?”

“Sure.”

“Will the baby bird ever come back?  I can’t hear his chirps anymore.”

In his office, Dr. Evans sat down at his computer, opened a reporting form and began typing.

Patient:  Marian Hall
Age:  34
Diagnosis:  Acute psychosis break
Medications/Treatments:  Antipsychotic regiment including Clozapine, Thioridazine, and Lurasidone, group and individual therapy sessions
Impacting Event:  During the early evening of Thursday May 6th, Patient returned to the home shared by her and her husband.  She’d had plans to go downtown for a happy hour, but according to coworkers, she’d noted that she’d been feeling better about things between her and her husband, and she wanted to go home to surprise him instead.  As far as authorities could tell, Patient encountered her husband in their bedroom with his mistress.  She retrieved the husband’s handgun from his dresser drawer and shot both dead.  Afterward, the Patient strangled their toddler son in his crib.  A neighbor found the patient sitting in her driveway, with blood on her hands and a dazed look in her eyes.
Notes:  Patient appears to have suffered a complete mental breakdown and does not understand what she’s done, likely to avoid the reality of it.  I will continue to work with her to see if we can break the romanticizing of these events in her mind.

Dr. Evans read his notes and nodded.  He went to click the save button, paused, and then typed one last sentence in the form.

Big Fan,92,6,"Aiden scrolled through Reddit, posting to his regular subs. A few fan theories here, some skateboarding videos there...the usual. Outside his sixth-story window, the city at night hummed with its usual activity. He sighed; despite being literally surrounded by people, he had no one to hang out with. The ones he met online never seemed to stay in his orbit very long.

He saw a chat request pop up. Minerva369 said ""Hi! I've been reading your posts! I'm a big fan!"" Guess I should be polite, he thought. ""Thanks :-)"" he wrote back. ""I recognize your skating hangouts! We live in the same city!"" she replied quickly. Aiden frowned; where was this going? Was she really interested? Was she even really a girl? The Internet was full of weirdos, pretending to be someone they're not. Still, it couldn't hurt to keep talking.

He typed a message. ""What part of town are you in?"" She wrote back quickly. ""Near 27th and J St."" That was a more rundown part of town, but not too far by bus. Before he could reply, she had. ""We should meet IRL!"" Aiden felt like he was being set up. ""You've seen my videos...but what do *you* look like?"" A minute passed, and she sent him a selfie. She was a bit plain, but had a radiant sweetness in her eyes. Aiden shrugged; why not? ""Where should we meet?"" She sent an address, and ended with ""Can't wait!"" Before he could suggest they meet in public instead, she had gone offline.

Best to be careful, he thought. Grabbing his dad's taser, he set off for the address. By bus, it only took five minutes. He arrived at the building; it looked condemned. Aiden fingered the taser in his pocket, ready for anything. Taking a deep breath, he walked inside.

He got an alert immediately. ""I saw you walk in! See you soon!"" He found the elevator and pressed the button; it arrived seconds later. Maybe the building is OK, he thought: the elevator still works. He pressed the button for the 8th floor, and waited. Finally, the door opened.

A gentle breeze flowed through the halls; it had a sweet sort of smell. Grinning, he searched for the number she had given him. She sent another alert: ""Getting closer!"" Aiden thrilled in his heart; finally, someone who wanted to be friends! And maybe more...but for now, he thought, just play it cool; let it happen naturally.

He passed over a metal grate in the floor. Suddenly, it opened; he found himself plummeting toward a big metal fan, spinning furiously. He hit it hard, the blades slicing him fatally. He struck the ground with a loud thump. With his last shreds of awareness, he looked to his side; there lay the desiccated body of a girl about his age. Glumly, he realized that what was left of her face was a close match for the girl in the picture.

Big fan, indeed, he thought as life slipped away.",1620992722.0
Alone in a Crowd,42,7,"  

I can’t remember the last time I’d been on the street in lower Manhattan when I hadn’t been hit up by some bum for money. And it’s not that I don’t have any sympathy for those less fortunate than I, but in the final analysis it isn’t my job to take care of them. That’s what Democrats are for. Besides, if you give them money, it only encourages them to be lazy.

Strangely enough, the last several times I’d been out, I’d been approached by the same guy, some half-black, half-white lowlife with long, nasty hair and a stench that could make you wretch. And it wasn’t as though I’d always come across him in the same spot, either. Last time I was on the corner of West and Liberty. The time before I’d been up around Chambers and Greenwich, and one time I’d been all the way over on Pearl and Wall Street. It was like he was everywhere, like he was stalking me—it was starting to freak me out.

Yesterday I was walking along 86th, trying my best to be inconspicuous, to blend into the crowd, when suddenly I heard that familiar voice—it made me cringe.

“*Hey banker!*” He called me banker. “*Banker!* *Wait up!*”

I tried to ignore him, but the next thing I knew he was walking along beside me. Great—just *great*.

“You got a dollar I can have?” he asked.

I ignored him.

“Or two—or three. If you gimme three, I can get a Big Mac *and* fries.”

“I don’t have any money.”

“You don’t? Then how’d you get that big ol' latte you’re drinking?”

“I used a credit card.”

“Okay then—you can use a credit card for me, too.”

“No I can’t.”

“Yes you can.”

“No I *can’t*!”

“There ain’t no reason for you to get upset. I’m just trying to eat.”

“Yes there is a reason. You’ve asked me for money every day for the last week, and every day I tell you the same thing. Can’t you get it through your thick skull? I’m not giving you any money! Now, leave me *alone*!”

He stopped walking. For the love of God, I have no idea why, but I stopped too. I looked back at him—he looked hurt.

“You sure you don’t wanna give me no money—buy me a Big Mac? This is your last chance.”

“I’m sure.”

He sort of shook his head, then he glanced up and shrugged. “I tried,” he said, and then he walked away.

I watched him meander through the crowd—not bothering anybody else, of course—and then he was gone, lost in a sea of people. When I turned back around, there wasn’t another soul in sight—not one.

I’ve been walking around the city for over a day now, and I still haven’t come across anybody—no people, no cars, no birds. Nothing. As far as I can tell, I’m the only living thing in Manhattan.

""He loves me not""

""He loves me....""

As I pulled the second last petal off, my heart sank to my stomach. My eyes began to water.

""He loves me not""

My little red dress was by now covered in dandelion petals, one flower after the other. My makeup was dripping off my face, my hair was oily to the touch, and my hands were too shaky to even hold the stem of another dandelion. 

""Why can't he just love me, I did what I was supposed to, right?""

As I was sobbing, I could still smell the rotting flesh that was left by my husband. He said he was going to commit, I though that I should put him out of his misery first.

Richard Peters and His Friend,12,5,"Richard Peters hadn't seen his friend in years. A visit was overdue. A mix of excitement and nervousness refused to leave him as he stopped his beaten car outside the tall apartment building. Richard was astounded when the greetings took place, as his friend presented his lavish home, describing precisely the features and obscure elements of every room. Paintings, electronics, heated carpet, revolving doors, vintage utensils, a pingpong table bought at an auction in Singapore, a hipster rug.

When they sat down by the fireplace from some absinthe and talk, it wasn't long before Richard's words lapsed onto the topic of family. He wished he'd resisted, as soon as the questions fled from his lips. Spoke he did of his distant son, his uncommunicative ex-wife, his tragic attempts at renewed love. His friend, thankfully, had much positive to contribute. His sisters were exercising and in ""tremendous condition"". His cousins had new jobs in accounting thanks to their studies. After these mentions, however, Richard saw that his friend was picking at his fingernails. Richard could recall that this was his anxious giveaway. *Should I pry?* Well, he didn't have to.

""It's just my father,"" he said.

""What's the bother?""

""A terrible fall.""

""He'll be OK, I'm sure.""

Richard felt bad for questioning. Perhaps he could've diverted the topic. Family shouldn't even have been discussed! Not this soon!

""I'm sorry,"" Richard continued. ""Ah--another absinthe then, Danny?""

His friend nodded patiently.

Danny watched as his friend drunkenly bumped into the walls of the corridor, giggling as he went.

""*Goodbye* then,"" he spoke before closing the door.

After a few minutes he went to the bedroom and slammed his fists against the wall.

""Fucking stupid cunt!"" he yelled. ""I wish you'd never fucking come!""

He circled the room and stared at the painting above the mantelpiece. Then he turned his head to the balcony.

""I can't be living with this,"" he said, rushing to his secret wardrobe. ""I've got to get you out of here.""

Richard Peters was behind the wheel of his car in the apartment building carpark, sniggering and fiddling with the buttons of his radio, slurring and singing away badly to himself. *Sha-la-la! Sha-la-la!* Absinthe, my goodness, he told himself, the joy it brings. A long time since I've danced with you, absinthe! He drummed the steering wheel. *Sha-la-la! Sha-la-la!*

But his elation didn't stay around. While he examined some muck on his shoes a horrendous thump sounded; something had crashed into his windshield. The collision had made him almost leap into the roof of his car. It had made his car leap too. The windshield was destroyed. Blood trickled through one of the cracks and landed on his dashboard.

Every trope you can think of that makes up a haunted mansion, well this large place had it all. I was in love with it the first time I saw it and I was definitely taking pictures. I heard that the ghost that haunted this mansion usually comes out at 3 am and when it nears to 3 am, you are to go to any spot and circle out a salted circle and basically stay inside the salted circle. Salt is the protection. 

I love haunted houses and they are just amazing don’t you think and I dunno haunted houses have this thing about them, they have atmosphere a history and a story which a new house doesn’t have. Anyway as I was taking pictures, and I was definitely staying way after 3 am, and I had torch lights and other necessities with me to urge me to soldier on. Even the smell of this old mansion was better than any perfume I had ever smelled. I have always been one for history I guess. 

The first odd thing I did notice was that in some rooms of the mansions there were other well aged salt circles with skeletons inside them. I took pictures of them and I thought they looked awesome and no I wasn’t scared. Then as it neared 3 AM I made my salt circle and I stood inside it with so much anticipation, and as I prepared my camera to take pictures, my camera went funny and switched off. 

“Oh darn” I thought to myself but I guess memory will be enough to see this ghost. Everything went dead quite and in a moment there was nothing and then this ghost appeared in front of me. It looked at my salt circle and just smiled at me. It then showed me the head of some man it had decapitated and it then tried to aggressively attack me but the salt circle protected me. The ghost then calm down and sat down on the floor while making random strange noises and hours went by, but this ghost wasn’t leaving me. 

Even in the morning this ghost was still here and I had some salt left and I tried to make other salt circles next to mine and I got to the entrance of the room, but ran out of salt. The ghost is laughing at me. I then thought about the skeletons inside the other salt circles around the mansion, this ghost is a patient one. It knows I will get hungry or I will eventually die. I have some food but not a lot. The ghost is just doing weird random things and even tempting me with some hot food. Don’t come to this haunted mansion.",1621034817.0
The object of my hatred,159,12," “Sir, this is exactly how you ordered it.”

“And I’m telling you it’s *not*,” he slides the box of pizza across the counter, jamming it into my chest. Smacking his lips together, he says, “I ordered a crunchy, thin crust, extra alfredo sauce, cheeseless pizza with mushrooms and philly steak. Got that?”

He continues his tirade before I can interject, all red-faced with a throbbing forehead vein.

“Considering where you are in life right now...” he looks me up and down, surveying my Domino’s uniform, “...I know you probably didn’t make it past college, so I can understand if my order was too much for your brain to handle at one time.”

“Uh, I-I’m so sorry sir. It’s been a long day and I wasn’t really concentrating,” I say, lowering my submissive eyes to the counter. He laps it up, snide face groveling in the sense of power he gains from abusing me.

“Know what?” I pipe. “Say I fix this by paying for this pizza out of my pocket, and have a new one made for you?”

His brows lift, and he chews on my proposal awhile, testing its palatability. 

“Now you’re talking boy,” he grins.

Fifteen minutes later, I hand his new order across with that employee-of-the-month smile.

“Have a nice day!” I beam, forcing energy into each word so it doesn’t seem like I’m adding the tired, hackneyed phrase as an afterthought.

All that’s on his face is his signature sneer before he greedily grabs the pizza from the counter, and strolls away wordlessly.

His face. Middle-aged. Gaunt, horse shaped face. Balding. Grey eyes. Paper thin lips. It’s a unique face. Hard to forget. And I won’t forget him, what he said to me, how he mocked me and walked away scot free. 

I don’t forget him even after serving countless customers for many more hours. I don’t forget him when my shift ends at 6 pm and I go home. I don’t forget him when I unlock the door to my apartment, walk into the kitchen, grab a large bag of flour, and lay it onto the floor. And I certainly don’t forget him when I take the butcher knife out of the drawer.

I keep every agonizing detail of his face and figure crystallized in my mind as I lift the knife into the air, and in a moment of clarity, plunge the blade down into the bag.

After letting my anger bleed out onto my object of hatred-- I sweep up the mess, throw the punctured bag of flour into the bin, then plop onto my couch to browse tv channels awhile until I land on a *BREAKING NEWS!* report.

Dental Compulsive.,10,1,"”Do you bite your fingernails?”

I froze. “Well, no…” as I saw her start jotting something down on the med sheet, I continued, “but… I suppose I do bite my cuticles. Do you mean… could that have caused this?”

She looks up from the sheet with a solemn look. “Is that why your hand is covered in blood?” I nod. She sighs. “I’m sorry, but biting your fingernails is one of the number one causes for bite changes. If you want to prevent any more, you’ll have to stop.”

I ran my index finger over the coarse, choppy skin on my thumb, feeling the sting as a layer of skin pulled back over the open wound. “Okay. I’ll try.”

“Good. We’ll schedule a new appointment for March 18th. Let’s hope the bone doesn’t erode any further. Keep up the flossing.”

2PM. I caught myself with a bloodied thumb in my mouth. I hadn’t even realized I was doing it. The taste of iron made me shudder, and I quickly wiped the saliva on my shirt. Clenching my jaw, I tried to make my teeth match up. It was uncomfortable, as it had been for months. I ran my tongue over the newly filed-down surface of my teeth. *Good grief… Do I have no self-control?*

10PM. I stood in front of the mirror, electric toothbrush in hand. It had already buzzed 5 times, indicating I was past the recommended 2-minute mark. Still didn’t feel clean, though. Reluctantly putting it down in its charging dock, I leaned closer to the mirror and lifted my upper lip. The gums around my implants had receded again. I could clearly see where the sculpt ended and the inlay began. Picking up a piece of floss, I slid it in and tried to get as high up as possible. It was the second time this evening I flossed around the implants. They never felt clean after the first time.

Feeling my head hit the pillow, I bit down on my retainer. The plastic made a soft cracking sound as it distorted. Her words echoed in my thoughts.

“Because of the pressure on your implant, the bone has eroded, and your gums have retracted. There are pockets up there where the bone used to be. You can’t reach with the floss, bacteria can get in, and the bone will erode further, until the titanium screws are exposed and fall out.”

The surgery was made only five years ago. I was told they should last until I was forty, fifty. So much for having a brilliant new smile.

As I woke the next morning, an unfamiliar sensation made me jolt up. I could feel the stinging in my jaw. I found myself standing in front of the mirror, trembling. Carefully, I poked at the porcelain again. *Shit. It definitely wiggled.*

Song of the Young,13,2,"The little girl Tiffany stood in the wings, her face covered in all sorts of make-up. She was getting ready to sing in the ‘Song of the Young’ competition, where the best young singers in the world could win a million dollars in prizes.

She was also feeling very nervous. What if she doesn't do well? What if the vitamins she took to help her sing wasn't enough?

Her mother came up to comfort her. ""You're a star, Tiffany,"" she said. ""You make us proud.  Don't you ever forget it.""

The little girl Tiffany’s name was called. She stepped on the stage, took a deep breath, and began to sing.

She sang of enchanted pasts, of mermaids, and of things living under the sea. Her voice carried tales of pirates and warriors and ships of the ocean. Her voice was so sweet, it sounded like a swan gliding through the water.

The little girl Tiffany got a standing ovation. Not to mention the prize. A million dollars, in her pockets.

“Well done,” whispered her parents. It was all over.

When they got home, the little girl Tiffany removed her hot costume. Underneath it were many scars that punctuated her small body. Scars from not singing hard enough, well enough.

Presently she came to a small room in the middle of the house, and she turned on the light.

A lone chair sat in the middle of the room, and sitting on the chair was a boy. He was tied up, gagged, and his eyes were wide with fear. He had the little girl Tiffany's tousled hair, the same petite figure, the same green eyes. The chair creaked as he tried to move.

The little girl Tiffany walked up to him and kissed him gently on his cheek. As she did so, the life drained out of him and his eyes went slack. His skin shrivelled up until he was as thin as a sack.

At the same time, the little girl Tiffany felt strength and energy rushing through her. Her head was filled with the sound of music and how to sing in perfect pitch. Some of her scars even glowed and closed up, healing herself.

She gave the boy a pat on the shoulder. The boy muttered something incomprehensible.

""Sorry dear Jeffrey,"" she said softly, her voice frail in the silence of the room. ""But Mother and Father won't stop beating me until I sing well for them. Every day.""

It was dark and warm as we moved along the road. I'd been on many trips like this before, and they all ended the same way. 

As we picked up the pace the air turned cold and I could see the moon and stars in the sky. 

I noticed a figure ahead of us further down the road, we were catching up quick. 
At the sound of footsteps behind her the figure turned. A look of mixed curiosity and worry crossed her face, unsure if she was being followed or not. She turned away and picked up her pace a little. 

We picked our pace up too, we needed to catch up. Within moments we were right behind her. And then I was soaring through the air in an arc, and not just once, over and over again, until Lauren stopped screaming.

Tickle! Tickle!,38,4,"Helen was awoken by footsteps in the bedroom. She nudged her husband, Jeff, who begrudgingly got up to look around. He knew there would be nothing there and he found exactly that.

""Go to sleep,"" He moaned. Helen, unconvinced, closed her eyes but lay awake listening.

After a short while, she heard the footsteps again, this time closer to the bed. She opened her eyes and saw a pair of enormous, hairy hands and a familiar voice shout out:

""Tickle! Tickle!""

Helen tried to cry out but was paralysed; trapped in a freeze frame of misery. The hands felt her body and roughly tickled her.

This carried on until dawn. As Jeff stirred, the Tickler stopped and left. Helen saw the cupboard door open and close.

She was sweating, her pyjamas clinging to her tormented skin. Her husband was alarmed by her appearance.

""Are you alright?"" He asked. ""You look awful.""

Helen began to cry and told him about the assailant. She lifted up her pyjama top and asked if there were any marks on her body. There weren't. Jeff went over to the cupboard to inspect it. He couldn't find anything - or anyone.

""Pookie,"" He pleaded. ""It's probably one of those dreams where you're still half awake. I used to get them when I got stressed at work. They can be pretty realistic.""

The next night Helen went to bed early. Fatigue had made her irritable and she was glad for her head to reach the pillow. Her husband was downstairs watching ""Condorman"" on Disney Plus.

As she drifted off she heard the cupboard door. She was unable to move again and soon heard that distorted, recognisable voice.

""Tickle! Tickle!""

Two hours later, when Jeff started to come up the stairs, the Tickler ran back to the cupboard. Helen exploded tearfully when her husband entered the room.

""Again?"" Jeff asked, hugging her. ""Sorry. I dozed off downstairs.""

She nodded.

""You're seeing Doctor Patel tomorrow,"" he exclaimed. ""This isn't normal.""

Her husband stayed awake for the rest of the night so Helen could rest. The Tickler didn't return.

In the morning, Helen and her husband sat in the consulting room. She told the Doctor what had happened. Her blood pressure medication could be producing night terrors, he said, so he prescribed 2.5mg of clonazepam.

Jeff dropped Helen back home and went to work. She was going to sleep during the day but feared that without her husband around The Tickler would assault her.

That night, they both went to bed early. Helen took her medication and fell asleep comfortably while Jeff played ""Subnautica"" on his Switch.

A few hours in, she woke up struggling to breath. Her throat was being tickled violently. Her chest tightened.

In the morning, Jeff found Helen dead. He pulled the covers over her and tearfully walked over to the cupboard, opening the door.

Love and Pain by Edvard Munch,844,22,"Love and Pain is a strange painting by Edvard Munch, usually thought to depict either a passionate kiss, or a vampire feeding, or both.


The work has an alluring fairytale aura, recalling the handsome illustrations from Victorian children's books. 


Much of the painting is muted and subdued, except for the tempestuous red hair of the dominant character, contrasted with the pale, drained face of the submissive recipient of her kiss.


Munch painted six slightly different versions of Love and Pain. Alongside ""The Scream"", it is perhaps his signature work.


Three of these versions are in the possession of the Edvard Munch museum in Oslo.


The museum is reluctant to allow scholars to inspect the works, officially due to security reasons. One version was stolen in 1988. The thief returned the work the same day, in a state of mortal terror.


Two other versions of the painting are thought to be lost, and another sold at auction for $38.2 million dollars. 


The following information cannot be verified. It is mostly comprised of the unpublished research of a Norwegian fine-arts student, ""K"", since mysteriously deceased.


One version of Love and Pain was destroyed in a fire in the early years of the twentieth century. A wealthy businessman's wife doused the painting in kerosene, and threw a lit match. The fire consumed her, too. The businessman's body was found in the building, but police believed he had already died, sometime before the act of arson.


Another version was also burnt to ash, in 1950, in an Oslo mansion. The mansion was razed to the ground. The thirteen bodies of an entire upper-class family were partially recovered, along with the bodies an unrecorded number of live-in servants. All but one of the deceased was said to have died sometime before the fire.


The version sold for close to $40,000,000 is never displayed. The owner originally showed the work to many guests, who reported feeling entranced by the painting. One of these people spoke anonymously to ""K"", describing an odd sensation, akin to hypnotism, with an accompanying numbness followed by feeling deathly faint. This witness was later hospitalised for an odd, undiagnosable anemia.


The wealthy owner was eventually found dead beneath the painting, alongside his wife and infant child. All three appeared to have starved to death. An unnamed police officer described them as ""just skin and bone.""


This incident finally compelled the Munch museum to secretly switch their originals for copies, in the interest of public safety. Visitors are only allowed fifteen minutes to view each of these copies, as even a facsimile can apparently retain an echo of the uncanny atmosphere that accompanies Munch's original six paintings. Long-term employees won't stay long in their presence. Many visitors comment on the crucifixes subtly adorning the walls above each copy, and visitors also lament that the museum gift-shop sells prints of every Edvard Munch work except for Love and Pain.",1620899599.0

We mostly drank, fucked and snorted cocaine.

I barely remember the city.

I remember Harlan Gills asking me, ""Norm, you wanna see something absolutely fucked?""

He led me through an alley to the back door of what looked like a club. Banged on it twice. Some guy eyed us through a slit, then let us in.

""You're gonna love this shit.""

The place was dark and loud. The Prodigy drowning out screams, moaning—

""You been here before?"" I asked.

""Every time I'm in town. Best way to blow off steam.""

An old woman met us. She held out two fingers.

""No,"" Harlan said. ""Just one.""

He pushed me toward her. ""What you want?"" she asked.

""Fresh meat,"" Harlan answered for me.

The woman left.

She returned with a naked middle-aged cripple, eyes down, shoulders turned inward. *This is fresh?*

Harlan grabbed my shoulders. ""Show my friend the smorgasbord.""

""The fuck?""

""What you fancy?"" the old woman asked. ""You like knife maybe? Hammer?""

""What am I supposed—""

Last Week at Work. Hey...it's May.,57,9,"I’ve said this before, but I *reeeeeeeeeeally* love my job at Skulk Sani-Services. Let me tell you what I got up to last week!

On Monday, Matthew was *a cut above the rest* when his torso travelled on a meat hook two floors up. I took extra care to make sure only the best part was kept, and even brought in my friend Barry the Butcher to help. The rest is likely in a hot dog somewhere. Bon appetit!

On Tuesday, Tammy *burned the midnight oil* when she took a dip in light sweet crude. It happened to also be on fire. And sure, technically 2 AM is past midnight, but she’s always been committed to her job. The way that stuff sticks to skin and flesh, even when burning down to the bone, is a sight to behold. The Human Torch is my favourite superhero!

On Wednesday, Wendy was *cash-strapped* as she took a tour of the central bank. She got a great view of the money-printing process as the machines cut her into neat little rectangles. My boss had to pull a few strings for this one, and we spoiled a bit of cash, but now I have all these WendyBucks to play with. I’ve always wanted my own currency!

On Thursday, Thaddius *dodged a bullet* when it whizzed by his head in the basement. He couldn’t dodge the building that fell and turned him into mist as dynamite charges strapped to support columns were activated when the bullet found its mark. I should have my own home reno show!

On Friday, I told Fred not to *cry over spilled milk* when he could swallow no more. Sure, the acid I added might have singed his insides a little until he bled out internally. And yeah, I may have told him he’d die if he spit out a single drop. Look on the bright side, he drank over a gallon without vomiting! At least he’ll have strong bones and teeth!

On Saturday, Sarah was the *fifth wheel* as she tumbled head-over-heels behind my drag car. It took some effort to secure her all the way around the rim, but she did a great job keeping the back from hitting the road as I accelerated at full speed. Too bad she only lasted one race. Look at me, I’m Sebastian Hamilton, or Lewis Vettel, or whoever!

On Sunday, Scott *paid lip service* to my wasp problem as he kissed each one of the 500 little buggers infesting my tree. They kissed back, of course, and some of them were so friendly they also kissed his eyes. Unfortunately they got upset, flew into his throat, and suffocated him. But his skin looked so much younger and tighter when bloated. America’s next top model!

My job is very fulfilling, especially when I get to clean the streets of serial killers, negligent oil executives, bank robbers, crooked architects, tainted milk sellers, car thieves, and unlicensed plastic surgeons.

An Idea Of Death,17,2,"Have you ever thought about the afterlife?

And I don't mean subscribing to the typical schools of thought around death. The heavens, the hells, the purgatories, the rebirths. I mean really thought about it. Come up with something personal to you. You don't even have to believe it, if you don't want to, just think to yourself...

**""What happens after we die?""**

I've gotten an interesting few theories, some hypothesis', a conspiracy or two, but I received the most interesting idea recently, yesterday, in fact.

Would you like me to tell you?

**It's painless.**

Painless in passing, and painless afterwards. That was the idea.

Imagine floating, on nothing. Literally nothing. Not in a way that you'll ever experience while alive. You're just there. On an inky ocean. In the inky ocean. It's so dark that you can't even see your fingers, or hands, or... anything, for that matter. You can't see, hear or feel anything around you.

And you stay floating. For a day. For a week. For a month. For a year. **Forever.** It's only you and the nothing, nothing but you.

And that seems generic, right? Kind of like atheism, but there was something interesting in it.

Because when you stay alone for so long, unfeeling for so long, you start to forget.

Colours fade, voices mute, feelings numb, faces blur, everything slowly, slowly, **slowly,** slips away.

**Nothing forces you to forget. It's all done of your own accord.**

Everything you ever knew goes. Absolutely everything, until there's nothing left.

And then you're back. And you learn it all again, and then you're gone.

I told you it was interesting.",1620954392.0
Traveling,144,9,"A briefcase slams into my kneecap and I am startled out of my daze.

&#x200B;

“Sorry about that, mate, mind if I sit here?” the man asks, sitting beside me before I can answer. I grit my teeth, noting all of the empty seats around us. I wonder how anyone could be so inconsiderate.

&#x200B;

“Did I wake you?” he asks, staring at me intently. I think about not responding before I answer, I have zero interest in having a conversation with him. 

&#x200B;

“I guess, kind of.”

&#x200B;

“Well, I did or I didn’t, certainly has to be one of them. Unless, of course, you were daydreaming.”

&#x200B;

“I suppose…” I turn away from him slightly, hoping he will take the hint. No such luck.

&#x200B;

“Dreams… They fascinate me. Amazing how you can just, venture off. How you can just leave your body behind and go somewhere that doesn’t even exist. If you venture out there enough, you can get better at choosing where you’re going. You can change paths. You can go anywhere,” he muses, looking up at the ceiling philosophically, then turning to me abruptly, “Do you ever wonder if you’re actually awake?”

&#x200B;

“No,” I reply firmly, doing my best to disguise the uneasy feeling in my gut. I look around at the other passengers, hoping that someone will notice how uncomfortable I am.

&#x200B;

“It’s kind of a tough question though, isn’t it? How can you really tell? I mean really, ***how can you tell?***” he leans in closer to me and I recoil. 

&#x200B;

""...I don't know,"" I mumble.

&#x200B;

""Well, think about it, where are you going right now?”

&#x200B;

Where am I going? It dawns on me that I have no idea. I can’t even remember getting on the subway…

&#x200B;

“I… I…” I stammer, wracking my brain for any details about the trip. 

&#x200B;

“You… you…” he mimics, “Actually, that brings up an even better point. Who are you? Can you think of anything about yourself? Anything at all?” 

&#x200B;

I bring my hands to my ears. I don’t want to hear any more. 

&#x200B;

Nothing is coming to mind, nothing. Not my name, not where I live, not what I do for a living. 

&#x200B;

“You get it now, don’t you?” 

&#x200B;

“Please… I just want this to stop,” I moan. 

&#x200B;

As soon as the words leave my mouth I feel the metro slowing, and relief washes over me. I'm so glad this dream is ending that I start to laugh. The man beams at me.

&#x200B;

The doors open and I start to rise. I realize I’m unable to and I start to panic. The man only shakes his head at me.

&#x200B;

“We all exist for some reason or another. We all play a part for someone else,” he says, picking up his briefcase, “Well, this is my stop. So I guess this is goodbye. It was nice talking to you.”

I tried for a fresh restart of my life.,9,1,"I am a single woman living in a dainty little town in the middle of nowhere. My parents came to this country trying to escape the Korean war. The only thing they left me was witchcraft. When I was young, I didn't need so many souls to sustain my power, but as I aged past my 60's, I needed more and more. But I have collected a sizable amount to have myself reborn, more efficient and powerful. All I needed was 1 more soul, as luck had it, the apple fell right in my lap.

I was approached by a man who sought my powers to bring wrath on innocent souls to satiate his lust for a woman. I cautioned him but he was blind with greed. So I invoked an old spirit to do his bidding. I felt multiple souls rising from my work, more than what I had wished. So I started running as fast as I could with an incantation, cutting right through the wood and the grass. My mind was fixated on my rebirth. As I used divination, I saw that the man had killed the woman and her children by putting them through a bloody wood chipper, what a mess, i thought to my self.

But then, all of a sudden, I felt a bright flash of light and then darkness. I don't know how long was I out, but I opened my eyes to find myself naked in a walk-in refrigerator. I tried to get up, but i couldn't feel my left leg. It had been amputated. I use divination to see a large man sitting at a table eating my roasted leg. I knew what had happened. Something clicked inside me. I immediately concentrated all my energy in to the leg at the table by evaporating my body and soul.

When he finished consuming me. I let all my energy surge. As he screamed in agonizing pain, I absorbed all the materials inside him and burst out of his body, a young, new, powerful me, drenched in his blood. I now had complete control over his soul, but he himself had harvested so much energy, I practically put his rotten soul back in to the husk that used to be his body. I didn't think I was this powerful. Not only did the soul assimilate, it turned the husk in to a demonic looking person. I had a full blown skin walker under my command. This turned out better than I thought, not to mention I have punished this evil guy in to being a skin walker to harvest souls for me.

But then I heard a faint little screech, he has an evil, inhuman, unsettling grin on his face. He slowly opens his mouth with a raspy whispering voice and said, you think you are punishing me, but what you've done is evolving me to my true potential. I can't wait to paint those portraits for you.",1620952774.0

Button Girl,86,2,"  The button girl crept from the closet and to the foot of Sally’s bed. The plastic buttons clacked and clattered, as she rubbed her hands on the closest bedpost.

  Sally woke up to see the button girl’s face illuminated from the light of the moon that streamed in from the window. She was too terrified to scream. She saw red eyes surrounded by white buttons, yellow buttons for hair, buttons for clothes and skin, 

  The button girl gripped the outside of Sally’s foot. 

  The hand was cold, smooth, and lumpy.

  Sally struggled, but the button girl held firm.

  She found her voice and shouted, “Nana! Nana!” 

  The hallway light turned on.

  Her grandmother rushed into the room, her nightgown flowing at her knees. 

  “What is it, sweetie? Are you okay?” Her grandmother said, concerned.

  Sally looked around the room confused and shocked.

  There was no one. Yet her foot still hurt from the grip of the buttons and her leg was sore from the pull, her covers strewn from the thrashing motion she made trying to escape.

  “There was –” she panted, “a monster, a doll who tried to get me.”

  Her grandmother leaned in, “You’re flushed. Are you feeling alright?”

  “No,” Sally wailed.

  “I’ll bring you some water, it was just a bad dream.”

  “No!” Sally cried again, and stumbled half out of bed. She reached for her grandmother, “Don’t leave me,” she said, in tears.

  “None of that,” the old lady responded, “it’s time to be a big girl. It’s an old house that has odd sounds and can make you have nightmares. Now that you’re awake, it’s time to calm down. Fix this bed up.”

  Nana helped Sally straighten the covers.

  “Lay down,” she commanded. 

  Sally did as she was told, but hastily turned on the bedside lamp also.

  The grandmother eyed her.

  “To help me not have nightmares,” Sally answered, unsure if she would be able to keep the light on.

  The five minutes between her grandmother leaving to get a glass a water and coming back with it, felt like the longest five minutes of Sally’s life. She lay in bed, staring straight forward, afraid to even blink. She stayed still as stone and barely breathed.

  Nana returned with a glass of water. 

  She drank it, eyes open, still scanning all corners of the room, and eyeing the closet door.

  “Now, that’s better. Call me if you need me again,” Nana said, “Good night.” 

  When she exited this time, Nana hit the switch by the bedroom door. 

  The side lamp flicked off, shrouding her in darkness again. 

  Sally stiffened and made an involuntary peep. She felt everything go cold and clammy. 

  She held her breath, jumped out of bed, and lunged towards the switch. 

  She didn’t make it.

  She fell, tripping on the floor beneath her. 

  When she looked back behind her, under the bed, she saw a hand made of buttons gripped her ankle.

I will never give up,6,1,"
I will never give up and I will never stop believing. A couple of months ago a leak started dripping from the ceiling of our flat and I knew straight away that the flat was trying to bless us. My family didn't seem to think so and told me that I needed to sort it out and get it fixed. I told my family how this flat is trying to bless us and I will do no such thing to stop the flat from blessing us. My wife pleaded with me and even my own two children begged me to get someone to fix it or to fix it myself.

I will never stop believing that our flat is blessing us and forced my family to stand under the leak and let the drip roll down their face. My wife went first and when the droplet ran down her face so elegantly, I knew the flat had blessed. Then my daughter took her turn and when the droplet from the leak touched her face she squealed a little and get discomfort bothered me. I told my daughter how she had been blessed by our flat and that she should be grateful. When my son then went under the leak and he just stood their not even showing any emotion when the droplet touched his face.

Then my family turned to me and begged me to now get it fixed and I was disgusted by their intentions. They agreed to be blessed by the flat so that I could fix it afterwards. They thought if they just played with my little game that I would be over it or something like that. How wrong they were and I will never stop believing and I am grateful to being blessed everyday by the leak in my flat. My family can think whatever they want or do whatever they want, I always believe.

Then one day the leak on flat started leaking blood and I was so happy. The flat has started blessing us even more that it is using blood. My wife started shouting that we needed to check on the tenant that lived above us, but I grabbed her and made her be blessed by the flat with droplets of blood running down her face.

I then grabbed both my children and made them be blessed by the droplets of blood leaking from the flat. Just me now and my wife and children are seriously sick. I don't care as I will always believe and I will never give up believing that the flat is blessing us. Its my turn now to be blessed by my flat.",1620945294.0
Subway.,14,0,"The subway scares me. It always has, although I don't have a clear reason of why. I've never believed the urban tales regarding mysterious bodies appearing in the tunnels, cursed lost children or the occasional cultist church located in the depths of the inner bowels of the place.

I keep telling myself that a subway is nothing more than a building,a man made monstrosity that crawls underground , drags its wheels into shrill whines at every curve. It's size,going under all of the city is terrifying. It's everywhere.

I tend to stare out of the door in my daily,stuffy commune from work to home and home to work. My soul drained a single drop every day. I don't think I'm the only one that feels like this,I don't think I'm the only one afraid of this monster.  

Faces are a blur,and the darkness of the dingy lights blinking off gives me a sense of being a whole. A simple organ within the body of an inconceivable,man made god. 

I stare out, at my reflection on the glassy surface, the darkness behind so pure that it feels like I'm staring into myself. Almost like staring at yourself after you cry, the mirror giving you the same,albeit more familiar, glassy look.

Stay Thirsty,81,5,"It all begins about 20 years ago. I was diagnosed with Veronimy and was prescribed two meds. I pop two pills twice a day, and virtually no more symptoms of V. 

The only side effect of the drugs is incredible thirst. Dry mouth, more specifically, but the result is I drink. A lot. We’re talking several gallons a day. Mostly water, but I drink tea, pop, chippen, whatever I have access to. 

This month, I think I drank myself into another reality. Into yours, actually. And I know you’re rolling your eyes.  

This is not like water poisoning or quenchesse or anything like that. It was, ironically, a very “fluid” thing. I just sort of felt myself severely hydrated and then...resettling. 

I started to notice subtle changes.  Really subtle, like my comforter changing in color from red to orange.  Then the watch face on my Apple Watch got all rearranged. Nothing big. I’m really bad at details so I wonder if there have been dozens of things I never noticed. 

The kicker was NBC. I turned on the TV and flipped channels, and Saturday Night Live was on. But down there in the corner was the network logo—not a feteresque but a peacock. I got online. No feteresques here. I actually cried, terrified. 

Now I see things constantly. I will be at work and there’s a coworker I’ve never met, handing me tadges like we’ve been partners for years.  Then my brother just disappeared. Matt is gone, like he was never here.

I have no real clue what IS happening to me.  It felt like all the drinking caused it. But I have no clue. Stupidly, I thought maybe it was my Veronimy, so I doubled my dose of pills, which made me drink more water which I’m guessing sloshed me more into this alternate reality!  And now I can’t get back. 

And here’s the part that I think qualifies this as a scary story:  This world, your world, is missing two big things:  Poplevits, and Nancy Darsha.  Without the poplevits, there’s nothing to keep people telling apart fact from fiction. And without Nancy Darsha, I don’t see you regulating the environment. And frankly, I don’t want to be here when the boot hits the fan!

But I have no clue how to get back. I tried not drinking for two agonizing days, but nothing happened. I’m stuck. 

If you’ve read this far and don’t believe a word I’ve said, good on you. The whole thing is ridiculous. Just pray that you never find yourself in a land slightly different than your own.

It was one of my regular patients from the office—Alice Stone. I recognized her voice. She was nuts, but was generally harmless if left to her own devices.

*“This is Doctor Feelright—what’s on your mind, Alice?”*

“*I’ve made a mess in your room.”*

*“I’m here, Alice.* *Now tell me—why do you think you’re at my house?”*

There were rustling sounds, and then came another voice, a sweet little voice I knew all too well.

There was an interminable silence, but finally—

*“You see?”* Alice said. *“I told you the truth.* *I wouldn’t lie to you, Dr. Jensen.”*

I needed to stay calm—needed to keep Alice calm. My little girl’s life hung in the balance. *“Alice, can you hear me?”*

We ended the call soon thereafter, and I obviously ended my radio show early.

Monster Under the Bed,39,5,"When I was five, my older brother Terrence told me that if I ever let any part of my body dangle off the bed for too long, a monster would drag me away. At the time, I was a dumb kid and I thought Terrence was smarter, so I believed him. I realized later on that my brother got his kicks from scaring the hell out of me. He wasn’t smarter. He was meaner, and he took advantage of my fears. 

Even now, in the sweltering California heat, I still sweat it out under my blankets rather than risk getting abducted by a creature under my bed. I know now that he was lying, but I can’t stop. It’s a habit borne of fear. 

It’s been a miserably hot summer, but I couldn’t even pop even a toe outside my blanket. I woke up in a pool of sweat. 

“Hey, dumbass, you’re alive!” Terrence grins at me, and I feel a stab of embarrassment. “Another night of hiding from monsters, Ernesto?” 

I don’t respond. It’s easier to ignore him. If I say anything back, I’m bound to embarrass myself. 

“What’s next, Ernie? Is a killer gonna jump out of your closet? Is Freddy Krueger gonna haunt your dreams?” 

“Stop it.” 

“C’mon, Ernie! Remember when I scared you so bad by pretending to come at you with that knife? You cried so hard you puked!”

“Tonight, I’ll sleep regularly. I won’t be afraid anymore.” I slapped a hand over my mouth. 

Terrence laughed and left the kitchen, leaving me alone with my regret and fears.

I looked away, humiliated again. My eyes met two reptilian eyes, glinting with malice. The disembodied eyes were moving closer to Terrence. He was too busy mocking me to notice.

“*Alibi.*” He said, continuing to tap. 

“What?”

“Alibi. You have an *alibi*, not an ‘abili.’” His expression remained stuck, like some statue wondering if I would crack before it. *Down-looking college prick.*

“So you talked to ‘em then? Danny and Mary Ellen? I told you I ain’t done nothing. Now I want my lawyer. One that does suing too, so I can get mine for all this horse shit.”

He narrowed his eyes just a hair and he stopped his tapping. *Oh, that wrinkled his britches,* I thought. 

And then the pain began. I couldn’t explain why, but it shot through my elbows and knees like a branding iron. 

The detective spoke after watching me shift and wriggle a spell. “You seem uncomfortable Mr. Rennick. Something bothering you?”

“No.  Well, actually, maybe—“

“We know everything from everyone involved,” he interrupted. “We know your brother lied for you.  You guard his secrets too. We know his wife is afraid to contradict him. To many black eyes. Too many nights cowering in the shower of their squalid little bathroom while he pounds on the door. We know. Now confess.”

My joints shrieked as the pain grew, hot and angry. I was sweating. I could feel the telling beads tickling my forehead. 

“Hey, cop, something’s wrong. I—I think I need a doctor—someone to help me.”  I felt the skin pull across my chest, my ribs tightening around my lungs. Breathing was harder and my joints were throbbing in sickening waves.

He opened the thin brown folder and slid a single photograph across the table. 

“Did *she* need a doctor? Where was *her* help?”

*The girl*. I saw her perfectly as my vision blurred red around the edges. Her face—a swollen mess of blood and bruises, indigo and yellow. I recognized the peeling linoleum tiles of my trailer’s floor, but I had scrubbed and scrubbed. Nobody saw. I buried the body deep. He didn’t have pictures of the others. But how?

The room seemed to constrict, the fluorescent light growing brighter and brighter overhead. 

“How—d-did—you?”

“I told you. We know.”  

I tried to think as an icy, high-pitched pain rang in my head. *They’ll—fuck—they’ll give me the needle if—*

“They did, Mr. Rennick.”  

I couldn’t see his face now in the growing brightness. Only the photo. Only the girl. 

“H—Hell?”

*Eventually.*  I could hear his voice like thunder in my head. 

*This is judgment. And we’ve only just begun.*",1620856779.0

Nearly every bit as beautiful as Emilia,279,13,"Mrs Juniper had a well documented history of birthing ugly ducklings as she termed them. 


With each consecutive year, out plopped baby Jaxon, Thom, twins Bella and Blaise, Luca--each of them apparently great disappointments to an inconsolable Mrs Juniper. 


That all disappeared when baby Emilia arrived; the golden girl. 


With a well endowed slim figure, dainty fingers, a sleek curtain of strawberry blonde locks, and fair skin, eleven-year-old Emilia seemingly outshone her older siblings; the golden girl. 


May 17th was Emilia’s birthday. Her parents forgot the rest.


Mr Juniper didn’t even know the rest of his kids’ names, calling them “boy” or “girl” if he ever needed to acknowledge their existence.


At school nobody believed the fact that the lovely Emilia was related to the rest of her 'rat-faced' siblings. 


But worst of all was how their mother treated them. None of them had ever truly known what mother’s love was; having watched Emilia leech all that away from them.


But today all that was going to change.


For the first time the five siblings invited eleven-year-old Emilia to one of their exclusive, weekendly garden shed meetings. 


But as Emilia trod into the shed --the wooden door being shut and locked behind her-- the sight she was met with was of Bella hefting a shiny saw in her hands, Blaise dragging an iron shovel behind her, and Luca stroking the blade of an awfully big kitchen knife. She whirled around to find Jaxon and Thom's burly figures blocking her exit. The gang of siblings advanced on her wordlessly like stalking predators. 


The pack pounced upon her, Jaxon making sure to hold Emilia down with a knee and gag her with his hands. It was a team effort really. Butcher knife in hand, Luca easily sliced up Emilia’s delicate fingers like chopping carrots. Bella sawed at all major joints of her slender limbs until she struck bone, before Blaise hacked away at that bone with the tremendous force of the side edge of the shovel, cleaving her body into distinct pieces. Using a pair of pliers, Thom firmly held Emilia’s pearly white teeth, and violently wrenched them out, red nerves still attached to the teeth like weeds. Jaxon got to work with a rusted spoon to scoop out Emilia’s gorgeous blue eyes. A razor blade was used to scalp the mop of blonde hair from her head. 


The siblings weren’t exactly sure when Emilia died, though she eventually did. They weren’t concentrating on her really. 


Soon the siblings laid out all the parts harvested from Emilia, dividing the most prized parts amongst themselves, giddy with excitement for what came next. 


All their life they knew they could never be as beautiful as Emilia, not even half as much. But once they were done with the transplants, they hoped to inherit just a fraction of her good looks. There was no need to be greedy for parts. There was certainly enough of Emilia’s beauty to go around.",1620833518.0
My Husband,17,0,"My husband was the kindest man you’d ever meet. He would never leave people behind, nor would he mock them. He loved life. He loved smiling. My Eddie. 

 I’m not saying he’s a saint. We’re imperfect, right?

    That man had a secret. Although we never hide anything from each other, at least the important stuff, I swore to him I’d never tell anyone many times. Eddie wouldn’t budge. He told me he didn’t want to tell me because it had something to do with his childhood. He hated that I kept mentioning it. I remember thinking, Was he abused? Was he traumatized by some event? I couldn’t help it, wondering what it could be. Night and day. Working, not working. 

Some nights, Eddie worked late and I just lay there in bed. Sometimes I wasted time rewatching Breaking Bad, History’s Vikings and playing Dynasty Warriors -- just to wait for him. He would understand.

And I would understand.

At least I thought I did. 

 If he only just told me earlier . . . 

On one particular night, I thought I heard something: some animal broke into the garage again. Damn raccoon, I thought. Instead, I found Eddie. I saw him. In the garage. Crying. He was curled up like a scared kid in one corner. I switched the lights and I gasped. I froze, froze my blood, everything. Just standing there in a nightmare. My God, I thought I was in a high-quality scary movie: the blood splatters on the floor, the smell of death, or some kind of animal. 

“Eddie,” I remember saying. “Holy shit, Eddie!”

Eddie’s cries hushed.

“Hubby, what happened?” 

Despite my initial shock, I approached him. Maybe he got attacked by a wild animal and managed to fend it off and got hurt doing so. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions. A wife should check on her husband sometimes, right?

As I stepped closer, Eddie said something:

“Babe, don’t come any closer.”

“Just let me make sure you’re okay.”

“No. Don’t . . .” 

I stopped. Now that I think about it, I should’ve listened. 

It was, at that moment, his eyes just, his eyes -- his eyes were different. Different as in creepy different. You know, when you flash your light at that annoying raccoon at night, and it looks at you with glowing eyes? Those kind of eyes. 

    I began to back away, back to the door. I thought I was having a nightmare, or a night terror, sleep paralysis. Something. It felt real, so real and it was. My heart was racing, my skin was goosebumps. My sweet husband. Is this his secret? A dark secret he tried to hide from me?

    Slowly Eddie approached me, his face more like a wolf’s. His skin grew thick black fur. 

    But for some reason, he didn’t attack me. 

    Fuck that. I punched the wolf-thing, ran for it until the cops arrived because of the nosy neighbor.

    I miss Eddie . . .

Aka Manto,18,6,"If I had to pick the worst possible time to be haunted by a ghost, I’d say it's on the toilet. 


I was sitting in the stall in school, doing my business. I waited until class started so the bathroom wouldn’t feel like a zoo (I’m a shy pooper). 


Naturally, I was surprised when I heard a knock on my stall door. I knew the bathroom was empty, so I wasn’t sure why someone would beeline it to my stall. “Come back with a warrant.” I said jokingly. 


The knocking on the door ceased, and a loud grunt came instead. I looked down at the ground, but didn’t see any shoes, or legs, for that matter. I started getting ready to leave when a yellow mask slid under the stall.


It was completely yellow, except for two black eyes and a wide black grin. The mask started to wiggle, and a red mass propelled it up, taking the shape of a large cloak. The figure stood much taller than me, looking down at me through it’s mask. It’s mouth didn’t move, but it began to speak. 


“Red?” It croaked. “Or blue?”


Two hands poked up from under the cloak, holding red and blue rolls of toilet paper in each hand. 


I was only a high school student, but I have never been less sure of what to do next before in my life. I didn’t know what to say, so instead I said nothing. I slowly reached back, watching the things mask follow me, and flushed the toilet, before shuffling to the side and out the stall door. 


I waited for it to vanish, or the hallucination to end, but the thing just floated there, holding it’s colored toilet paper rolls. As I washed my hands, I heard the bathroom door open, and a classmate I sort of knew walked in, giving me the ‘bro nod.’

 

The thing almost immediately floated up to him. “Red?” It repeated. “Or blue?”


“What the fuck?” My classmate chuckled. “Who is this?” He reached up, pulling the mask off its face. I didn’t see what was underneath, but the thing grasped my classmate by the shoulders, before dragging him into the floor as if it was a puddle of water.


I fell back, shocked. I was about to run out and ask for help when the thing reappeared, blocking the doorway in front of me. 


“Red?” The croak came a third time. “Or blue?” 


I felt goosebumps cover my whole body. “Ummm, no thank you?” I didn’t mean for it to sound like a question, but the fear controlled my voice. 


The thing nodded, and sank back into the floor. 


I called the police as soon as I left. I told them about the intruder, but left out the supernatural aspects. It’s been about two weeks now, and they still haven’t found my classmate. 


From now on, I’ll just hold it in until school lets [out.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ninjagall15/comments/mk9dfu/insomniac_bite_sized_scary_stories_now_available/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",1620877818.0
Keep calm and stay away from knives,1388,73,"That’s what my grandma always told me; *keep calm and stay away from knives*. She always knew where she had me, even when I lost myself. Even when I started hurting myself. Even when I felt like a lost little girl who didn’t belong anywhere. I hated the world, and it hated me back. But not my grandma. She was the only one who truly understood me.

*Keep calm and stay away from knives.*

My fiancé seemed like the kind of guy who’d get me. Who could really learn how to love me, and in turn could teach me how to love him. And for a while it worked. I was lulled into a false sense of companionship; a frail, superficial bond never meant to last. 

I guess it’s the age-old human lie, isn’t it? The kind we tell ourselves so we can look the other way. So we can justify our own inability to act. *He didn’t really hit me; I just walked into his fist*. *He’s not manipulative and controlling; I’m just weak and co-dependent*. In the end, *I’m* the problem, not him. 

Flogged and flayed and flagellated, that’s how they leave us. My grandma knew this, because for the longest time she was one of us. But she kept calm and stayed away from knives. And when she learned I was the same, she taught me how to stay away too.

*Keep calm and stay away from knives*, she’d whisper to me when my mom wasn’t listening.

Sometimes it’d be hard. Nigh fucking impossible. I’d pick one up every now and again, feel the weight of it in my hand, practise hiding it in my pants, pulling it, stabbing and thrusting at shadows that bled me-shaped tears. But then I’d remember, and then I’d put it down. 

Stay away from them. Keep calm. Be smart.

That’s the thing, you know. My grandma was the smartest person I ever knew. But you’d never guess it from looking at her. Or talking to her. On the outside she radiated this ignorance, this aura of dumb kindness and innocense.

And I guess that’s why they never looked too closely at my grandfather’s death. Just a car accident. One of those things. Brakes fail all the time, statistically speaking. And besides, he never had any enemies. Sweetest guy you’d ever meet.

Unless you met him alone. Unless you happened to be my grandma.

*I kept calm*, my grandma told me. *And I stayed away from knives.*

She was a good woman, my grandma. Always found the best in people. And in a perfect world, I’d be able to honor her wishes. But this world isn’t perfect, and neither am I. I can’t help myself. I have to look him in the eyes when it ends. I have to feel his life slipping. I have to hear every pained gargle. Inflict a lifetime of torment. 

I kept calm, grandma.

But I couldn’t stay away from knives.",1620793557.0
Under The Blood Moon,10,1,"
It was midnight. And the sky blossomed like a pretty girl's gorgeous diamond necklace. Shimmering, shining and dancing for all to behold.
 
Felix and I’s apartment was on the tenth floor and overlooked the city. The 101 highway stretched out below us, with cars coming and going in wherever they pleased—field mice with turbo-fueled jet packs.
 
We sat out on the balcony with our bourbon and cigarettes. His teeth cream and shoes ivory white—me in my silk pajamas—rolling another spliff.
 
“Where do you think they’re all going?” Felix whispered.

I knew what my lover was talking about but pretended I didn’t. Hearing him talk is a gift to humankind.
 
“Who?”
 
“The cars, darling. There’s so many of them, but where are they going?”
 
Felix stood up and approached the balcony terrace. His frame lean and chiseled under a Versace robe. —Both hands massaging the rail.
 
“Anywhere they want.”
I slurred, wishing I had another drink in my hand. Maybe a scotch with ice?
 
“That's not true. I’d imagine...at least half are headed home from a job they despise. Only to get up and make the same drive tomorrow.” Felix replied. A relaxed smile was riding his lips.
 

“Okay...what about the others? It’s midnight, the witch's hour; maybe some are headed to a bar or club to let off steam.” I sat up and passed the spliff to Felix.
 
But my lover shook his head.
 
“No. The libido drives them tonight—not free will.” And he turned to me. And smirked.
 
The rim of his fangs headlight beams under our pale moon. Body glistening crystal bow.
 
“Why....are you with me?” Felix quipped. Now beside me in the blink of an eye. Quicker than a camera flash.
 
“Because I want to be.” I moan, letting him get a good whiff of my neck. His serpent tongue forked and devil red.

He begins to feed. Sucking my blood. The process more intimate than any other lover up to that point in my life.
 
I don’t orgasm. Because to moan and shudder would be for my pleasure, no, I feel...whole. Like giving myself to this...creature is my life’s purpose.
 
When my lover is done, he dismounts and disrobes. The scales covering his body like armor in view now. His talons, letter m shaped wings, and cloudy red eyes too.
 
“Be back soon, darling.” He says. And leaps off the balcony rail, his wings flapping. Letting the black of the night consume him. He’s gone—for now. However, I know probably off to feed some more.
 
And I feel right at home.",1620886312.0
In a Pen,45,4,"Sitting here staring at the ink in my pen is one of the best ways to touch that sadistic side of my life because trapped behind those two clear plastic cases are the characters of my stories.  And even though I’ll be typing this so that I may share it on a public internet forum (which I’m doing now), these words are being scratched and smeared on paper in black and blue.  Much like how I left Lilith.  Except Lilith is an experience and very unlike all the other monsters and demons who lurk inside the murky liquid.  I’ve often wondered how she fairs in there with them, but she won’t have to anymore.  I’ve decided to release her.

We met at a county fair.  She was in front of me at the fried dough stand.  My first impression was not really one at all.  I hadn’t yet noticed the tight cut-off jean shorts with the frayed fringe or the button down shirt she’d knotted to expose her trim stomach.  I almost always just kept my head down and made myself as small as possible.  When she paid, however, I heard her say thank you very clearly and there was something that made me lift my head.  She turned and I found myself staring into her eyes and there was that spark.  You know when it happens even if you don’t want to imagine it’s true.  Low self-esteem often allowed me to lie to myself about things I automatically knew.

“Hey,” she said with a crooked grin.  My heart pumped.  She must have also recognized the attraction because she then asked, “Share this with me?”  She held out the cherry covered treat.  Usually, I only had mine with confectioner’s sugar, but I really didn’t want to refuse.  We spent the afternoon together and she didn’t know it, but we spent the evening together also.

Attraction is an odd thing.  You see, as soon as I’d met her I knew I was going to kill her.  That was the attraction for me.  I can only assume that deep down inside her somewhere she was attracted to being killed.  Why else would she be so drawn to someone whose intentions were so sadistic?

There are times when I’m so angry I stare at my pen and believe that I can boil the fluid inside.  I want that hot, pumping solution.   That’s why, on our picnic blanket, I stopped choking her.  Her face went from purple to deep red while I dug my thumb nails and pierced her throbbing vein.  Oh, my god that rush was unreal.  I bathed in it and we laid there for hours in sunshine.

And now, I’m letting her go.  I had to.  No.  I wanted to.  Sitting here imagining this, looking at the concrete walls that have been my home for the past ten years, I have two pieces of paper before me.  She, released from a pen and the parole board's acceptance releasing me from another.",1620853809.0
Just Another Day At Work,0,1,"The programmer stared blurry-eyed at his screen; the code danced before his eyes, seeming to mock him. He had spent the last month on a popup project; finally, he was back to his main project, which needed to be complete before he could go on vacation. So his much needed break had been delayed a month.

He sent a Skype message to Sadie, one of the junior programmers, warning her that he was modifying the same code as she was, but that he would deal with the merge conflict, which promised to be extensive. She wrote back to say she couldn't run the application she had built; the security software said she didn't have permission. He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes; the I.T. department's never-ending war against their productivity had managed to get even more oppressive.

He asked her if she had tried rebooting; she said she just did so. He sighed; that usually fixed problems caused by unannounced software pushes. Sure, it also killed productivity for twenty minutes, as the computer rebooted and the disk thrashed mightily starting up all that ""security"" software, but at least there was some hope of getting back to useful work. Not this time.

He let out an anguished cry. His fellow programmers in the open-office environment didn't even flinch, or give him dirty looks; they knew his pain all too well.

All he could tell Sadie was that it wasn't happening to him. His skin crawled as he realized he was looking at his future. She said she was going to call the Help Desk.

Dimly, he realized that Visual Studio has locked up, and couldn't be closed due to an ""internal operation"". The close box flashed madly, like it was trying to give him a seizure. He found several cl.exe processes that couldn't be killed, not even with administrator privileges, so finally he had to reboot too. He sensed the virtual demon had moved from her computer into his.

As his workstation shut down, it said ""Preparing to configure Windows; do not turn off your computer"". Yep, I.T. pushed something to his computer, breaking the heck out of it, but hadn't provided any sort of notice. Undoubtedly, part of their massive overreaction to the recent successful phishing attack. Unsettlingly, he noticed that, even though the computer was off, the Windows logo was still on the screen!

He knew he was down for at least twenty minutes, so he opened his desk drawer to get a snack...and realized he was all out of Costco seaweed.

Miraculously, he managed to get Skype running after only ten minutes. Sadie told him that I.T. support was now asking her whether Microsoft Office was working for her. A few minutes later, Sadie had an update: she told him her trouble ticket was being rerouted to the security department, which meant she had to wait in line all over again.

All of a sudden, the impending merge conflict seemed like the least of their worries.",1620903099.0

I don't want my father's memories,10,0,"I don't want my father's memories and it has caused a bit of tension between me and my father. My father is dying and he now wants me to take his memories but I don't want to. The reason I don't want to is because my father has lived a hard life and I do not want to remember those for him anymore. He also wants to show me that losing is ok. The men in our family happen to lose a lot and by gaining the memories of my father's, it will prepare me for losing in life. My father tried to force some of his memories on me and I saw how my father borrowed money from the wrong people and when they came back to collect the money, they killed my mother as punishment. 

There is ever so much you can force your memories upon someone when they are not willing to accept it and my father pleaded that he has more memories like that, that I should absorb from him. He then started to threaten me that he will create bad situations while he is alive so that my children will absorb and it will be my fault. I told my father that I have no intentions of passing on my memories to my children if I ever have any. 

My father goes hot and cold and I am just going through the motions. Sometimes he breaks down and begs me to take some of his memories like how he lost my sister by taking part in some game show. If he won the game show then he would have won lots of money, but he didn't and he had to give away my sister. He feels that if he gave away his memories to me to hold, it's like he is still living on.

I got tricked by dark magic.,8,4,"I am what can be described at best, a mild-mannered isle manager at our little town's Walmart. I was born on the other side of the country, but life had brought me into this dainty little town in the middle of nowhere. Nothing ever happens in this part of the world, if anything we have lots of young people running as far away from this place seeking more exciting lives, especially young women. I bet even all the crime statistics in our PD is just missing persons report on teenagers who's probably partying somewhere in the cities. Except that, nothing ever happens here.

In all this, she's the only ray of hope I had. She had a radiating beauty that just encompassed me completely. Every breathing moment of mine was hers. But, she was married with 3 little kids. Though It didn't bother me. I had decided that I wanted her in my life. But she had a loving husband who treated her right, and this sight of theirs just suffocated me. Even though I never wished harm on a fly in my life, I kept praying that family to break.

I on the other side kept pursuing her and finally we fell in love. She wanted this to stay as it is because she loved her family. But I wasn't satisfied with her body, I wanted more. I wanted to take his place. In a moment of weakness, I consulted an old Korean lady who people gossiped about being a witch. I went to her and I confided that I want them separated. She warned me to be careful for what I wish for as it will come true and I will have to live with the consequences. But I was blinded by madness, I said I didn't care what it cost. So, she and I did a ritual involving dark magic. She gave me some ash and told me to sprinkle on him. I obliged and when he visited the store with his kids the next time, I put the ash on him.

In anticipation of it working, I went to our usual meeting when he's at work and the kids at school to make love. But to my shock the traffic was halted near her house, I got out only to see him standing in the middle of the street like a statue and not responding to what any of us said. Did he find out about the affair? my mind was racing when the police arrived and then they took him off. My entire world collapsed when I heard what had happened. The police said they think he killed and fed her and the children to a wood chipper. Did I do this? I lost everything, I wanted them to break apart, but not like this. Oh what did I do! I lost everything!!

The Boy Who Thought Too Much,1585,54,"  

“So, why do *you* think you’re here?”

“Because y’all think I’m a freak.”

The doctor waited while his assistant, a pretty, young woman, wrote something in her pad.

“Of course we don’t.” The assistant wrote more. “Don’t you think it has something to do with your parents?”

I shrugged.

The doctor read from a page in his file.

“It says here your mother and father killed each other, that they stabbed each other—” he read from the page again, “—seventeen times each.”

“Yes.”

“And you were there—you watched the whole thing.”

“Yes.”

“What a horrible thing for a young boy to see—just ghastly.”

“Yes—ghastly.”

“Yes, *yes*! It had to’ve been. Surely you must feel more about it than you’re letting on.”

“I do.”

“And? What do you feel?”

“Guilty.”

The assistant wrote in her pad.

“Michael.” The doctor looked at me with sympathetic eyes. “You’re not responsible.”

“But I made them do it.”

“Two people passing by your house said they saw your parents through the window—they were stabbing *each other*.  When they burst through the front door, they said you were just sitting there on the couch.”

“But I *made* them—I made them do it.”

The assistant wrote in her pad.

“Your parents were grownups, Michael. How could you’ve forced them to do anything?”

I was getting bored with this conversation. The doctor kept looking at me while his pretty young assistant wrote in her pad—she just kept writing and writing and writing. It was making me mad. I stared at her hard; she stopped writing and looked back at me.

“I think you’re tired,” I said, and then I thought about it.

The young assistant set her pad and pen on the table, and then she laid her head on the table next to her pad and went to sleep.

The doctor looked at her in sort of a confused way, then he looked at me, and then he looked back at her.

“She’s tired,” I said.

He looked at me again, sort of suspicious like. “What did you do?”

“I think you need some fresh air,” I said, and then I thought about it. “I think you both need some fresh air.”

The doctor stood and started toward the window. The assistant raised her head and followed after him. The doctor opened the window.

“*What’s—happening?*” he said in a shaky voice.

“I think the air is fresher outside.” I thought about it some more. “I think you both need to go outside.”

“*No!*” the doctor whimpered as they both climbed to the windowsill and stepped off—into the fresh air. I didn’t know what floor we were on, but we were pretty high up.

All the sudden I felt thirsty. There was an orderly outside the room before—he was still there. I thought about it. A minute or so later he came in with a Coke. He looked confused.

They had name tags, just like her. Rick looked her in the eyes and scoffed. ""I don't *think* so."" Jeff glared at her, arms crossed. ""You're *never* going to make it here."" A few more crowded around, their steely eyes fixed on Audrey.

""Just *look* at her,"" snapped Mandy. ""She wears such cheap clothes! Not a *single* designer label. Don't you have *any* dignity?""

""...What?"" Audrey stammered. She looked down at herself. ""But I *like* my clothes.""

""And what's with that *hair*?"" Lupita jeered. ""It's so red, it looks like it's on fire! And how come it has so many curls? Why can't it be *straight*, like ours?""

Audrey pouted as she flattened her hair to her head. ""I...I think my hair is pretty...""

""Wow...can you believe how *dumb* she is?"" ridiculed Tom. ""And *she* thinks she's going to *survive* here? As if!"" He leaned towards Audrey. ""You won't last a *week*!""

""We've already heard *plenty* of rumors about you,"" Walter scowled. ""No one is going to want to be your friend. *I* sure don't.""

Audrey tried to be charming. ""Aw, c'mon, Walter! *You* look like a nice guy!""

""Don't call me Walter!"" he steamed. ""Everyone around here calls me *Butch*...if they know what's *good* for them!"" He punctuated that by punching his open hand with his fist.

""But what about the bosses?"" Audrey protested. ""They can't let you behave like this! They'll stop you!""

""*Bosses*?"" Jeff snorted. ""They can't be around *all* the time. *We* run this place, not *them*. Even if they *do* show up, we'll just wait until they're gone. Then *we'll* be in control again!""

""C'mon, everyone! We're going to be spending a lot of time together!"" Audrey wailed. ""We should get *along* with each other!""

""This *is* how we get along,"" sneered Lupita. ""By hating *you*.""

Audrey shivered. ""It *can't* really be that awful here. It just *can't*! I just started here! Is it *really* going to be like this every day?"" She sniffled.

Mocking expressions washed over their faces. ""What, is baby gonna cry?"" They started taunting Audrey. ""Look! Baby's gonna cry! Audrey's a crybaby!""

Loud footsteps approached. They all turned to gape as a long shadow overtook them. She picked up Rick and carried him away. ""Oooh, someone's got a stinky diaper. Let's get you cleaned up!""

The others began to disperse. Jeff jabbed his finger aggressively at Audrey. ""You won't *live* to see kindergarten."" He stormed away.

Tears welled up in Audrey's eyes, and she began crying. Another set of loud footsteps approached her, and she found herself lifted out of her playpen. ""It's OK, baby, it's OK, baby,"" she cooed as she cuddled Audrey, then she sighed. ""I hope you don't turn out to be a *fussy* baby.""",1620813074.0
Numbers,38,4,"An envelope at the base of the door. Nothing was written on it. Sealed shut. 

   I stared at it and picked it up. I used my thumbnail to open it up and it tore easily. I reached it and found a single sheet of paper, folded two times over. I opened it up.

   “2-6, 2-1, 0-0”
   
   They were written in the center of the paper in red ink. 
 
   I read the numbers over once and then twice and then a third time. I looked up at the front door and opened it and stared out into the yard and across the neighborhood. The mail couldn’t have come yet. No birds were chirping.
 
   Behind me my mom was coming down the stairs and I shut the door quickly and quietly and knelt down and fiddled with my tennis shoes.

   “You got up early. Did you forget to do your homework last night?” She asked.

   “No. Couldn’t get back to sleep, that’s all.” I said, standing and folding the note up quickly and stuffing it in my jeans. We walked into the kitchen. I looked at the clock and saw that the bus would be coming soon.

   “Well, have a good day at school. Tell John that I hope he’s feeling better now. His mom told me what he’s been going through, with rehab and all.” My mom said.

   “He’s doing better now. See you in a little bit. Bye.”
 
   “Goodbye.”

——

Minutes passed and then a few more. The bus stop was practically deserted. Only a few kids, not my age. I didn’t know them. Where the hell was the bus? Where was John? He was always early to the bus stop.

   I pulled the note from my pocket and read over it. The first two numbers of each set had a dash between them. Subtract? Divide? A secret code?

   A phone rang and a kid answered. He groaned loudly and hung up. 

   “The bus isn’t coming. My dad said someone slashed the tires. We’ll have to walk.” The kid said. 

   A dark feeling in my stomach but I didn’t question it. They all started to walk. There’s no doubt we’d be late to school.

   I tucked the note back in my pocket and followed them.

——

The bell had already rung by the time we got to the school entrance.

   I glanced at the bike rack beside the entrance. There was only one. It was red. It was John’s bike.

   That at least cleared some things up.
 
   We walked inside.

——

I was thinking about the note as I walked down the hallway to math class. John was going to be there. Maybe I’d ask him about it.

   The time was “8:28”

   “2-6, 2-1, 0-0”

   What if I added the three sets individually?

   The clock turned to “8:29”

   2-6 = 8

   2-1 = 3

   0-0 = 0

“Eight thirty.” I said out loud.
  
What did that mean?

I looked up at the clock.

“8:30”

Gunshots sounded off.

I'll always be there,185,16,"You might not like me much right now, but I’ve been there with you through the worst times of your life. I’ll be there to the end.

I was there with you as we grew together, feasting on all sorts of delectable food. Didn’t we enjoy so many flavours of the world? Sometimes we got carried away, but we ate and got stronger, together. 

We tried a lot of “substances” together too, didn’t we? Alcohol, tobacco, a few different drugs. Funny, we both ended up liking tobacco the most. How many cigarettes have we gone through? Has it been thousands over the years? All the times we were outside together, taking breaks from the drudgeries of life for a brief moment of self-indulgence. We both needed them more than we care to admit.

I was still there when your parents found out about me. They cursed me, cried and yelled, and said I was bad for you. It’s not their fault, they didn’t know. They’ve never dealt with something like what we have. But I stayed, despite how much they hated me.

You didn’t tell many of your friends about me, but I wasn’t hurt. They wouldn’t understand anyway. The bond we have is unique, and they wouldn’t know what to do. Still, many of them found out, and some abandoned you.

I know it got hard for you. Really hard. That’s why I stayed even when you tried to cut me out of your life. You wanted nothing more than to be rid of me. When you saw I wasn’t going anywhere you had all sorts of people come after me. They stabbed me, cut me, poisoned me, burned me. They brought me to my knees and pushed me to my breaking point. But I was still there.

We’ve been together so long, and built such a strong bond, that we had become inseparable. I breathe as you breathe. I bleed as you bleed. I live as you live. Nobody can take that away from us.

All this fighting made us both weaker, but you insisted to keep going even when it became obvious I wasn’t going to leave you. I can’t leave you. I’m in your mind, your heart, your very bones.

Eventually, you stopped fighting. By then it had worn us down so much that we both knew the end was near. We lay here now in embrace, intertwined for eternity. It’s almost here now, we can both feel it. And we’ll meet it together.

And to think, this all started with a single cell in your lungs dividing uncontrollably.",1620775546.0
The thing in the stars,73,11,"We first noticed it when the light of an entire galaxy vanished overnight. 


Dwingeloo 1 just blipped out of existence. It was about 9.13 light years away, so it must have gone out some time ago. 


Next was NGC 55, or more commonly called The Whale Galaxy. At 6.5 light years away, it was closer to us than Dwingeloo 1 but far enough where we could observe the phenomenon from a distance.


Gravity pulled other bodies accordingly, positions shifted, but we had no way to trace where they had moved to. 


At the time of this document, over 100 galaxies over various distances have vanished. We got a dedicated team to observe specific galaxies, and document any anomalies they can find. 


“Sir, can you...come here for a second?” My team leader asked. I looked at his computer, seeing a large, inky blob slowly engulf the light being emitted in his feed. 


“What is that?” I asked. Maybe something was just moving in front of all these galaxies? Blocking the light from reaching us, maybe. 


“I’m not sure, I’ve gone back and reviewed this a thousand times.” My leader replied in a low voice. “If you look at the stars above it, they seem to go out for a second, before flickering back, like something is passing in front of them.”


It took weeks of review, and unfortunately for all of us, we figured out what it was. Our announcement was translated to every language, for every government to know about. We knew mass panci may occur, but everyone needed to know the threat, that they could simply vanish out of existence in a heartbeat. 


It was an organism, one bigger than anything we’ve ever seen in space. It floated through the vacuum the way a person would swim through a lake. We couldn’t make out specific details of the creature, all we knew is it was black, had flagella-like tentacles to propel itself, and it could move faster than the speed of light if it sensed prey. 


The worst part was we discovered what it ate. Galaxies. 


To a creature that massive, surrounded by the void of space, a galaxy must appear the same way a berry on a tree would. If and when the creature got hungry, it would float over to an entire galaxy, and engulf it into itself, consuming it. 


We have no idea how long it’s been doing this. The light from galaxies takes so long to reach us that we might not know how many are gone in this lifetime. 


As expected, the world panicked when we told them, mainly because of the question that every person who heard immediately had.

""How long until it reaches us?""


Truth is, we don’t know. We’re just a small speck in a massive sea of galaxies, the creature might never get to us, or it might get to us tomorrow.


All we can do is hope for a bit of luck from the [universe.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ninjagall15/comments/mk9dfu/insomniac_bite_sized_scary_stories_now_available/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",1620790969.0
"'Gumby, Can You Read Me?'",15,7,"Several early episodes of *The Gumby Show* are missing from the archives, and occasionally show up in unlikely locations. In October 2001, a PBS affiliate in Chicago discovered two short reels marked **GMBY-1K** and **YFGUMBY3**, which they duly handed over to local animation historian Dean Schoeff. The title card is missing, but the two clips have been given the unofficial name ‘Gumby, Can You Read Me?’ by fans. Unlike other surviving episodes from the time, the clips are entirely in black and white, suggesting that the footage is a copy of an earlier tape.

&nbsp;

The plot involves Gumby and Pokey in two separate rooms, trying to communicate with each other by using Gumby’s new Electr-O-Telegraph Machine, in which Morse code messages are communicated via a flashing light on a console. The same set is used for both rooms, filmed from reverse angles to make them appear to be different locations.

&nbsp;

The first part of the episode [00:00:18:01 - 00:01:32:20] serves as an introduction to Morse code for younger viewers (Art Clokey, Gumby’s creator, served as a radio operator during World War Two), but as the episode progresses it becomes clear that a third party is intercepting Gumby and Pokey’s messages and replacing them with their own. Oddly, no translation is given for the mysterious new messages, and the quality of the surviving filmstock has degraded to such an extent that it is difficult to decipher them with any degree of accuracy.

&nbsp;

The clip ends with Pokey complaining that the light on his Electr-O-Morse console has become too bright and is burning his eyes, and the screen flares to white [00:04:18:18].

&nbsp;

The second clip (assumed to be part of the same episode, although this is disputed) is approximately three minutes long, and shows two Blockheads using a bank of computer equipment to send messages to an unknown receiver. It should be noted that they are not the usual J and G Blockheads seen in most other episodes of Gumby – one has a letter Y on the side of its head, while the other displays the letter F, although it appears to have been put on back-to-front.

&nbsp;

The two Blockheads move in an uncharacteristically erratic and distressed way, and break away from their task several times to look around the room and make sure the door is securely locked. At 00:02:14:16, the magnetic tape in the computer stops spinning, and the equipment begins to shut down. The two Blockheads turn and stare at each other as the lights fade to black around them, followed by the sound of something hammering on the door.

&nbsp;

‘Gumby, Can You Read Me?’ was given its only public screening at a 2006 event in Atlanta celebrating 50 years of Gumby. A visibly shaken Art Clokey (who was in the audience) disavowed any knowledge of the episode, and later released a statement describing it as “a cruel hoax”.

Following Dean Schoeff’s suicide in 2012, the whereabouts of both clips is currently unknown.",1620820088.0
"When I was younger, I would watch my mother sleep.",20,0,"When I was younger, I would watch my mother sleep. I was a worrisome child, and thought something horrible would’ve happened to her through the night. I’d wake up, stumbling to the landing and squinting into her room praying to see the familiar rise and fall of her bedsheets to confirm she was in fact breathing. 

She would always wake up in a shock, asking why I’m staring at her, and I’d say I’d had a bad dream and she’d pull me into bed with her and we’d fall asleep soundly. 

But you know that feeling right? When you can feel someone or something staring at you? When you were in the playground as a child, and could feel the eyes of the other children as if they were lasers shooting the back of your head as you squealed going high on the swing? Or as an adult, in the checkout line if you’re taking 30 seconds too long you can feel the patrons behind you staring and judging you for taking longer than socially accepted? You know when someone is staring at you, watching you. 

My worrisome and anxious nature often lead to trouble growing up. I was wary of other children, I certainly didn’t trust my fellow teens, and as an adult life is easier on my own. I’d rather not have roommates who I’d worry about also finding dead and having to deal with. I dunno, it’s always been a bit of a morbid/irrational fear. 

So tell me why, why have I woken up just now, living on my own, with my bedroom door wide open and a feeling that somebody or something is watching me?",1620807525.0
An excuse to leave,11,1,"Stones, stones, stones, sand, stones. There was nothing to watch but the stones on those belts. The man disliked his job. He had begun to dislike his job more than usual recently so this day he didn’t clean out the pumps, and didn’t wash away the tailings that were building up under the drum heads. He just stood and hosed under a section of belt in the corner of the plant. Not many stones fell off the belt here but he hosed anyway and no one even saw him until about halfway through the day, when Graham came to find him to talk about start times, and finish times, and things that needed doing.

This happened every day; but this time the man asked Graham if he thought there was something wrong with the conveyor belt, and when Graham turned around to look the man kicked him in the back, hard against the conveyor. Graham spun around. The man pinned Graham against the belt as Graham thrashed and fought; the man was younger but not as strong, and for a while Graham was gaining the upper hand.
Graham fought with the man and yelled and cried out: “What the fuck are you doing?!” 
But Graham’s next protest was cut short by the belt finding something it liked, something it could grab hold of. Graham felt it and the man saw Graham feel it: the man had never seen such a frantic look in another man’s eyes; a look of realisation; wild, and doomed. It was a look he had only seen once before, in the eye of a wild pig he had stuck in the throat, hunting with his father and some dogs in the forest: a look that had stayed with him - and indeed almost made a vegetarian of him at the time. Graham reached back to try to free himself and the roller caught his hand. The belt was moving fast and he went in quickly. The man stepped back and looked. Stones stones stones bones stones bones, clothes wrapped around rollers, flesh and meat. 

Me, wide eyed. 

The man sprinted to the control room, leaving bloody boot prints, and yelled to the controller to stop the belt because Graham was caught in it. They both ran to where he had been and the controller almost fainted. Workers began to gather, quiet, grim: “Someone should call somebody.”

The man said he couldn’t handle this, that he had to go. Convincing enough, given the circumstances. As the man walked to the carpark the dust and dirt absorbed the blood off his boots and soon his footprints were clean. Back in the plant, viscera now covered all the belts, dripped onto transfer belts and rollers, and pooled on the floor. The man’s car keys jingled in his hand as he walked. What a mess.",1620817115.0
The Loch Ness Museum,12,1,"Graeme and his little brother Murray were running at this point. Graeme's friend, Hannah, tried to keep up with them. They were all going to a guided tour of The Loch Ness Museum. Due to Murray's usual 13-year old lallygagging, they were very late. ""Hurry up Hannah!"" Graeme shouted. ""It will start any minute now!"". They continued down the greenery-lined dirt path to their destination.

Finally, they made it to the museum. It was right on the shore of the Loch. Right in front of the building was a small, shallow pond. In the center of it appeared to be a large rock. Then, connected to the ""rock"", a long neck rose from the water. On the end of it, a small head with with rows of sharp teeth and two Kelly Green eyes. All three kids froze in fear. Then, the neck descended back in the water, and rose again.

Hannah noticed the mechanical, repetitive movements of the creature. ""It's just an animatronic!"" she giggled. Graeme turned to his brother, with a cheeky smile. ""I'll give you €10 if you touch that thing."". Without hesitation, Murray rolled up his trousers and stepped into the freezing pond. Hannah glared at him. Now they'll be *even* later from the tour.

Murray wadded knee-deep in the disgusting water. Hannah yelled at him to hurry up. The animatronic just put it's neck back in the water. A few moments later, he reached it, and touched it. He gasped at how life-like it felt. Just then, It's neck broke the surface again. Out of fright, Murray sprinted back to his brother.

Graeme gave his brother his €10, and they all went inside the museum. Fortunately for them, the tour *just* started. There were only three other visitors waiting for them. The tour was fun and all, but all it did was disprove the existence of the monster. It's ultimate goal was practically to make the visitors feel like knob-heads for *even thinking* it was a possibility such a creature existed.

After the tour, the guide allowed visitors to ask any questions before leaving. Murray raised his hand. ""This isn't a question, but I wanna say that the animatronic outside is *really* cool!"". The guide looked at him weirdly. ""What animatronic?"". ""You know, the one in the pond."". ""There is no animatronic in the pond.""

All three kids got chills. They decided to take him outside to show him. When they did, they were shocked by what they saw: the animatronic was gone! They heard a loud splash coming from their right. Something big just dove into the Loch.",1620812970.0
I (31F) wish my husband (44M) would pay more attention,75,12,"Long story short, my husband didn't pay attention to something we discussed, and messed up when it was important. Some backstory: when this happened we'd already been experiencing weird stuff in our house for awhile. First, it was ""kitty in the corner"". You know when you *kind of* see something moving, just out of your field of vision? That used to happen a lot, always in the same areas. Eventually we got used to it. Call it charm, or the quirks of a cute old bungalow. We started to jokingly call it our poltergeist, and blame little mistakes on it. You know, misplaced keys, stuff like that. All pretty harmless.

Then, the cats started acting spooky. Standing up and staring at corners of rooms, doing that weird chittering thing they do when they see a bird through the window. I started getting a little worried. It sounds silly but I started to wonder if maybe we had a ghost in the house after all (I watch a lot of horror movies though, so this is always a possibility in my mind lol).

Then, our son started having night terrors. From about age 2, almost every night he'd sit up in bed screaming, pointing at his closet. That lasted for a while, and was really exhausting for all of us...

My husband and I talked about it then; he doesn't really believe in the supernatural, but he heard me out anyway. I told him about this theory I read, where ghosts don't really haunt whole places like buildings/forests/etc. Instead, there's a possibility that they only haunt the spot where they died. That would explain why we only got kitty-in-the-corner in a few certain spots, and why our son was so terrified of his closet. He kind of laughed me off, but I thought at least he'd internalized it.

That's why I'm so frustrated with him now. I could have watched my kids grow up, could have heard their voices, touched their beautiful faces, let them know I loved them... if only he'd *paid attention* and built my memorial on the other side of the road. ",1620769215.0
The Heirloom,60,10,"My family has a tradition that goes back all the way to the 1700s. Every first born son in a new generation gives this particular engagement ring, an heirloom, to his would-be fiancée. It’s not particularly fancy or anything, a gold band, set with a single yellowish diamond. I think I remember my mother saying it totaled two carats, though I never saw her wear it. Too precious to risk losing. 

My family has other heirloom jewelry as well, some pieces with stories of wealth and prosperity, others steeped in tragedy. The engagement ring has a story of love; happy marriages and healthy children. A superstition, sure, but one that seems to have delivered on its promise for centuries. 

When I was in sixth grade I wrote a paper on the engagement ring for a class assignment.  I read through old letters written between my great grandfather, Hudson Markham and his fiancée, Marie Delacroix. She spoke of the ring. They seemed happy; genuinely in love. Marie’s sister married another Markham boy—not a love match. She was young and barely knew ‘Mr. Markham’ as she called him in *her* letters. Tragic by comparison. 

When my eldest brother firmly swore off marriage after a long relationship plagued by infidelity, I took it upon myself to carry on the family tradition. I found the engagement ring in my mother’s jewelry case and bought an antique box for it online. I already loved my girlfriend, Anna, but that promise of a long, happy marriage was too great to pass up. 
 
I finally popped the question yesterday on the first night of a weeklong family vacation. I took a knee on a cliff side gazebo overlooking the ocean. The setting sun painted the sky in oranges and purples. Anna said yes, well, screamed it actually, and the ring fit her finger perfectly.

I hadn’t told my parents of my plan to propose—my brother being the eldest, and tradition being what it is—but after it was official, I told my dad. 

“And she said yes? Congratulations, Alfie, she’s a beautiful girl. And don’t tell your gran I said so, but some traditions can stand a little...bending.”

“Thanks, dad. I was worried, but after what I read in great grandpa Hudson’s and great grandma Marie’s letters, I knew the tradition was...special.”

He looked confused. “I think you mean your great grandma *Yvette*.”

“No dad, Marie Delacroix. I read the letters.”

“Marie and Hudson *had* been an item, but Marie walked into the sea before they could tie the knot. Hudson married Yvette afterwards. His sense of obligation, I suppose.”

“But Marie had written about mom’s ring. The gold one with the yellow diamond.”

“No, Alfie, mom’s ring has three sapphires. Marie’s ring was a...tragic thing. Your gran always called it the *suicide ring*.”

I ran to Anna, to that cliffside gazebo where I had proposed. She had screamed when I went down on one knee. When she jumped, she never made a sound.",1620769694.0
Keep Your Eyes Closed,431,20,"The camping trip started off with five of us rolling up in a minivan loaned out by apprehensive parents, passing joints and sipping warm beer, not a care in the world. 

&#x200B;

Eventually we saw the cabin that James had talked up so much while Sara jarred us with her braking. We crawled out excitedly, myself, Dom, Karey and Sara taking in the site. For all of the shit James could talk his description was entirely accurate. I'd been stuck in a rut the last few months, but looking around at the beautiful landscape, I was glad James had finally been able to convince me to come. 

&#x200B;

James got a fire going, after a while we were all fairly hammered. 

&#x200B;

“So, who has a good ghost story?” James asked, looking around at us eagerly. Not getting the reaction he had hoped for, James decided it was up to him. 

&#x200B;

""I’ve got one,” he glanced at Sara to make sure she was into it. She didn’t seem against it. I groaned, this was sure to be long winded. 

&#x200B;

“The important thing,” James started, “is that we all keep our eyes closed.”

&#x200B;

“I’m not doing that,” Karey said flatly. 

&#x200B;

“It’ll be worth it, I promise its a good one,” James was practically begging. Karey glanced at Dom, who seemed interested in hearing the story. She sighed and crossed her arms. 

&#x200B;

“Fine.”

&#x200B;

James beamed at her. I finished my beer, trying to act like I wasn’t just as nervous as Karey. 

&#x200B;

“Now, there is absolutely no opening our eyes until its over. It will ruin it,” James drove this point again, his voice much lower than usual. We all agreed to humor him. I took one last look at everyone before James began his tale. 

&#x200B;

“Deep in these woods, up on the mountain, there was a sinister spirit that fed on fear, latching onto anyone who was unfortunate enough to come across it... This shadow stayed with you until it had taken away anything you had inside except for pain and fear.”

&#x200B;

James sounded like he was on the other end of a tunnel.

&#x200B;

“As it consumed, it grew strong enough to assume a physical form... It stalked its prey right to their homes, whispering in their dreams... They tried to believe that it was just nightmares, that they were simply hearing the whispers of the wind. This would go on for months, as the creature wanted its prey ripe with terror.""

Shivers ran down my spine, the urge to open my eyes was overwhelming.

“When it came to harvest,” James’ voice was now distorted, demonic in every right, “it would appear to you as a human. It would pretend to be a friend. You would spend so much time around it, never realizing what it was... Once you saw it in its true form, your soul was taken.”

&#x200B;

The Tale of John Harper,63,2,"In the Kentish coastal village of Pydd there resided a man named John Harper. He was corrupt when drunk and corrupt when not. He violently targeted those who stood up to him until all the courage in the village had dissolved.

John Harper persisted in Pydd like a chronic disease. As years passed his presence became more punishing. He violated households and terrified the villagers. The local men were emasculated with not a single one willing to challenge him.

For John Harper had a vengeful nature.

One balmy evening, with the majority of the village drinking in the King Edward Inn, John Harper stood at the bar silently, playing his games of intimidation. He would stare at everyone in turn who would respond by either bowing or turning their head away.

His gaze met a newcomer's who courteously smiled back. The stranger did not avert her stare, her ocean blue eyes meeting the murky brown of Harper's. The custodians noticed this incident and the babble and chatter slowly subsided. They had seen visitors contest Harper before, unaware of his viciousness. The last poor fool had been dragged to a cornfield where he was raised like an old scarecrow, his face burnt until it resembled the melted, featureless mask of a bogle.

For over five minutes the staring match continued until the newcomer stood up and walked towards John Harper. She raised her fist and tapped his forehead. He did not react. He was immobile, as still as a cathedral gargoyle.

The woman removed her headscarf and turned towards everyone. Her hair was so dark it could have contained stars.

""I've mesmerised him."" She explained. ""He can't move or fight back. He can only see and feel. You will not be judged by what follows.""

She placed a piece of paper on the bar. ""When you've finished with him, read the words written on that piece of paper and something will come to collect Mr. Harper. He is expected.""

The inhabitants of the Inn said nothing as they watched the stranger leave. Some argued that they would not partake in any acts of vengeance and left the premises. Others said they would gladly make him suffer.

Throughout the night years of frustration and fear were taken out on John Harper until he was a pitiful, wheezing memory of a man.

Father Fox finally interrupted the torture and picked up the piece of parchment to read the inscription.

To those who had inflicted misery on the village nemesis, the publican had supplied drinks on the house. To those who had not, they stayed purely with the intent to witness what was coming to collect John Harper.

Yet after seeing how his body had been vandalised, I feared the Lady had lied and John Harper would not be going to Hell unaccompanied.",1620766116.0
He Started It,24,0,"He started it. He knew what would happen. Still he had to get her going. The idiot!

You just don’t do that! She gets very angry. I can’t control her when she’s like that. He knew it.

When she sees red, bad things happen. It’s just a fact. She’s done bad things before, and he got hurt. 

He should have known what she would do when she saw that ad in his browser. You know, that one with the skinny young bitch in a bikini. She’s not selling vacations. She’s selling herself. And the pig liked it.

She knew what to do to pigs, and I listened. He put up a little struggle. But I listened to her, and opened his throat. The fight slowly left him, but she told me to stick him a couple more times. She told me I could never be too sure. 

She told me to clean the scissors, and throw them in the river. Take the pig to the woods. Strip it. Cut it up a little more for the coyote & birds. I listened.

Now that I’m driving away, I don’t even feel too bad. She said he started it.",1620782554.0
Chimes,11,4,"It was certainly something to behold, everyone was thinking the same thing but nobody would say it aloud, this was a work of art.  The little details were so good in fact it was sickening.  We don't know how long she been here and cause of death could be any number of things.  She hanged naked before us, gently swaying every now and then when the wind picked up, it was the wind that had led to this new discovery.  Sadly it's not the first body that's been found like this, we're looking for one sick son of a bitch, I'm only guessing it's a he as I can't conceive of a woman being capable of doing this, not very PC but sometimes you can't help but make assumptions.  Her body is tied to a frame like a crucified scarecrow, hanging from each finger and toe was a variety of coloured feathers.  Along each arm several holes perfectly spaced out have been made through the flesh and bone with fishing line fed through and attached to hollow metal tubes, making her into a gruesome wind chime and the noise made is what led some poor bastard to her discovery.  Her abdomen had been hollowed out and internal organs removed, except her heart that now sat in a small bowl which itself is on a small shelf fitted inside above the pelvis and is under a small woven reed arch, like I said, a piece of art, but i won't be putting that in the file.",1620797969.0
Give Me Mercy..,4,2,"I can't understand what got me here, perhaps my instinct? if it was then it betrayed me. I found myself laying on the hard ground, cutting me everytime i moved and the sun burning and cracking my skin. ""I need water now"", I said, but what could i even do? Moving caused me pain, staying still caused me pain, even air felt like daggers going through my body and stabbing me everytime I tried taking a breath...

I felt the ground vibrate under me and a glimmer of hope flashed through my mind. Boy was i wrong when giant silhouettes started pulling me from both of my extremities. I tried screaming for them to stop but they seemed amused by my agony and suffering. What sadistic pieces of shit. Flashes of pain ran through my body as they tore me apart. They laughed and giggled as i squirmed in agony, my mind blank and unable to think. Soon I was no longer one, I was two and then three and not long after i was bits and pieces. I still don't know how I managed to stay alive this long, all I wanted was death to end my sufferings and soon I found myself alone. Again. The rain started pouring and washed away my organs seperating them from me. As I tried to crawl back to my hole in the grass, my vision turned blank. Nothing.

I was dead.",1620804078.0
Whatever it takes,17,1,"I stare at the debt card in my hand.

How could I let myself loose so much money? Were the hallucinogens worth it? Thousands just for precious hours of escape?

I shook my head in an attempt to clear my head but my legs still felt wobbly. My baby was coming next week and I knew what I had to do.

I strode to the dirty counter and slid the card across to the woman typing away. She didn’t even look up when she asked “Are you here to provide or receive?”

“Provide.” I say in an attempt to sound confident.

“What are you providing?” She remained fixed on her screen.

“Whatever it takes....” 

“You will need to be more specific please.” She stops typing and looks over her glasses into my eyes. 

“.... My child is coming soon, there isn’t anything left on the card ....”

She pinches then rubs the bridge of her nose and massages it for a second. “You are sure you want to do this?” She asks solemnly but it still sounds like she is following routine.

“Yes I am.”

My vision is blurred staring through the window at the rows of babies.

The nurse inside picks up my child and I smile. 

They left me my teeth.

I raise what’s left of my arm and wave. The dirty bandages reveal an index and ring finger. They took my thumb. They took my right arm my left leg, a portion of my intestine and my right eye. Anything they could take and leave me alive has been provided.

So many pieces of me are gone.

Lull to Peace,4,0,"    Roland sipped down his beer for the last time. He finished and soon staggered home. It was a full moon that night. The lampposts lit the cobblestone street and the lone horse and buggy wheeled by him. Somewhere along the way, Roland stopped and puked, supporting himself with the red-bricked wall. And he then resumed his journey, kept on until he gripped the wall again. It was at that point, he saw someone standing before him from a distance. He could see it was a man: tall, middle-aged, wearing a long coat, a top hat on his head, mustache—maybe sideburns. 

    Roland laughed. “Drunk too much, I guess,” he said to himself. He rubbed his eyes and the man was not there anymore.


&


    The dwelling in which the man lived was small, simple. Roland steadied himself on the wooden bed and sighed. He faced the tattered black and white portrait set on a stand next to it. His young wife. 

    “I’m sorry, Lizzie,” Roland said, tears streaming down his cheeks. “I don’t know if I can go on.” After a time, he proceeded to wash his face with water from a bucket and noticed his fiddle. It was missing a few strings, the color almost gone. Roland walked over clumsily and touched it. “Remember I used to play this for you before the war?” He smiled at the thought. 

    Just as he turned around, there was a knock on the door.

    Knock, knock, knock. 

    Roland answered. He saw no one there, only a small parcel. Tacked on the parcel was a note; he read it:

    “THIS WILL BRING YOU PEACE.”

    Roland frowned and looked around. After all, it was now very late at night. The man thought and thought, then relented. He took the parcel in.

    Coming to his bed, Roland put the parcel next to his shovel leaning against the wall. The oil lamp still glowed and the man said, “To the morrow, I’ll open it.”


&


    A few hours went by, maybe more. Roland tossed and turned. Finally, he gazed at the parcel for ten minutes. Afterward, he got up and though he rubbed his head, he checked it. Under a new firelight, he pressed his callused fingers along the brown paper wrap. He tore it open. Inside the box lay a wooden flute. Again Roland read the note to himself:

    “THIS WILL BRING YOU PEACE.”

    Roland chuckled. “Music is beautiful.”

    With practiced hands and mind, he played the flute: daaa-laa-daaa . . . A sweet melody. 


&


    Time passed and Roland shivered. He suddenly woke and gasped. Someone was standing at his bedside. It was the mysterious man he had encountered earlier. A smile crossed the man’s face. And Roland pressed his back against the wall.


&    

   
   Come the morning: “Mister Tyler,” the landlord said, “I need to collect your rent.”

    No answer.

    Again, the landlord banged on the door. After forcing himself in, he stopped. In Roland’s bed was a pile of bones, human bones.",1620800992.0
Baby daisy,122,3,"I've always wanted to be a mother, I knew when the day came it would be the happiest day of my life. My baby was born on April 30th, my beautiful little spring baby, her being born into this world has been a fresh breath of air and I feel as if my love for her is growing faster then the spring flowers outside. I named my baby daisy, in lue of the beautiful Daisy's that spring up every year in my flower bed. Baby daisy has big blue eyes and rose pink lips, she babbles and coos like there's no tomorrow and when she suckles on my chest I feel like I was born to be a mother. They never tell you how stressful being a mother is, they never tell you the endless nights of crying, they never tell you about how painful your body will feel after the birth how much blood there might be. But through all of this I've only grown to love baby daisy more. 3 days ago after I fed baby daisy she wouldn't stop crying, her screams echoed across my house and left lasting imprints on my eardrums, I got so angry. Why wouldn't she stop crying? I fed her every day from my breast but she kept losing weight and growing frailer by the day. Why do I feel like I'm failing as a mother? Am I not good enough? I switched to the other breast today but baby Daisy's eyes have only sunken in more. I thought that the birth would be the hardest part, but my infants  constant wails shook and broke me. Today I got a call from my doctor, he told me that a man my age should start watching my blood pressure, I'm sure that baby Daisy's fits were the reason my blood pressure has been so high lately. I decided to calm baby daisy down by bringing her out to the garden. The flowers had grown so high and bloomed so beautifully, ""damn"" I thought- noticing a manicured finger poking up from under the soil, I stomped it back down and covered it with more soil. Baby daisy has grown quiet now, asleep at my breast. So still, she must be exhausted. Just like her mama, I mean after all, she is my baby.",1620738322.0
Ghost Story,873,20,"“Do you think ghosts are real?” the man asked.

The girl was lying in bed with a sheet pulled up over her head. *I really wish he would be quiet*, she thought. She hated scary stories about things that went bump in the dark.

“I think they are,” the man continued. “I think after we die, we can choose to come back.”

The girl clutched her teddy tight against her chest. *Please be quiet.*

“But what kind of a person would do that? Come back from the dead, I mean. Do you think they would be good or bad?”

She squeezed her eyelids together and tightened her mouth. *Why is it important? Why can’t you just leave the question unasked?*

“Personally, I’d say they were bad. Think about it: if they were good, there’d be stories like ‘grandmother's spirit saves family from car accident’, or ‘man who died in forest helps lost child find their way out’.”

Thunder boomed beyond the window to the right-hand side of the girl’s bed, sending a shiver along her spine. *I don’t care whether they’re good or bad, I just want you to stop talking.*

Heavy rain began pelting the glass.

“But those aren’t the kind of stories you hear about, are they? The ones you hear about are always frightening spectres who met bitter ends haunting creepy old buildings or dark tunnels.”

He was silent for a moment, then added, “That sure doesn’t sound like something a good person would do to me.”

The fine hairs on the back of the girl’s neck stood on end. *I don’t wanna hear anymore.*

“But then you’ve got to wonder, if they’re not good people, then why are they here? What have they come back *for*?” Floorboards creaked around the room as the man traveled around. “Maybe they’re sad? Or filled with regret.” The creaking came to a halt alongside the bed. “Or perhaps they’re angry about how they died and want to make others suffer like they did.”

The mattress sunk to one side as the man sat down. To keep herself from sliding into the dip, the girl pulled her trembling knees into her chest and scooted back. She didn’t dare expose herself to the world outside the blanket. *Please, PLEASE stop talking. PLEASE.*

Her eyes welled up with tears.

“But you still haven’t answered my original question.” The man leaned forward. Now the girl could sense his head hovering inches above hers. “Do you think ghosts are real?”

The girl’s body tensed hard. With a frail, trembling voice, she said, “I don’t know.”

Four pale fingers reached beneath the top of the sheet. “Would you like to find out?”",1620698965.0
I am a hollow shell of a man,9,5,"
“Reese’s puffs, Reese’s puffs!”

A soothing, sinister voice echos in the darkest recesses of my mind. I raise my spoon dripping with brown stained skim milk in the air with a trembling wrist. This is my 13th bowl this week. I crave the taste of something.. anything without the taste of peanut butter chocolate flavor.

 “Eat ‘em up, eat ‘em up, EAT ‘EM UP, EAT ‘EM UP!” The once faint whisper increases rapidly to a deafening yet inaudible scream.

As I collapse on my cereal covered knees I spill yet another bowl of chocolate slop all over the padded room floor. I plead, and cry in a cold sweat for the sweet embrace of death. Suddenly two men in lab coats enter the room with a gust of wind behind them to temporarily alleviate the stench of mildew and spoiled milk that permeated every corner of my prison. “No more! Please!” I beg, but it is no use. They restrain my wrists and ankles as one of the men prepares another bowl of breakfast cereal.

I don't really see the point....,8,1,"I wake up every morning, barely catch sight of the news. Some accident on I-80, I-90, whatever...more snow. We only have two seasons in this part of America and *it's fucking May right now.*

So much bad weather; it goes out in April or so, comes back in August. I don't really see the point. All I keep thinking about when it's bad is how Napoleon's butt got kicked, simply by Russia being too damn cold. The cold *here* eventually seeps into you.

We don't have conventions, Pride parades...the only thing we did have until recently was some zombie thing and a fuckin rodeo that happens every year. Yeah. Torturing animals? I don't really see the point. I just go on about my work. Not much of it since we're basically never outside, but whatever.

Typing is more like breathing. 92WPM? Used to be 114WPM. Have I written a million words in a year? You betcha. NaNoWriMo? Whenever I manage it. Receptionist jobs would be easy if the bosses didn't think secretary was spelled with an X. I mean if you reflect one letter to the other end, maybe, but can you even fucking imagine?

Coffee in a hot shower, muddled with a protein drink. I don't really get hungry that often, except for salty junk and rare steak. And no, the restaurant always overcooks it. Big Macs get their nicer flavor after three days. Kombucha is necessary. My visits to the restroom at work usually involved a plunger. I don't work there anymore, though that isn't why.

I didn't get fired, I quit. I smelled too many bodies in that place who didn't bathe, and when you bathe as often as I do, the stinkiest motherfucker in there shouldn't be your boss. The only non-creepy boss and she had to smell like she'd been rolling in dogshit. The last time she was sick, I smelled spinal fluid. That's not a smell you can really describe outside a surgeon's table...or a coroner's.

Regardless, that day I quit. I don't really see the point in working for an absolute pig. And the lectures I got about my food smelling terrible were no help either. I mean, look. Steaks don't bleed. That's myoglobin, and you don't find much of it, even in a blue sear. And they don't stink when there's *nothing on them,* asshole.

So I'm back home, just holing up from the heat. When it does get hot, I love and hate the weather...in the cold, I can breathe. The hot just makes my lungs grease up with vapor and I cough my brains out.

Get out of the shower, throw on clothes, go to tbe gym. I don't really see the point; all the smelliest people are there, shoulders pimply with undisclosed steroid use. Synthol needs to be injected *under* the muscles, shitbird. Quit staring me down, today is back day.

God, I can't wait until the snow comes back. All I can smell and taste is spinal fluid.",1620778682.0
Rats in a Sewer,74,15,"The rat nibbled its way through the sewer.  The smells were so attractive:  the cloying, earthy scent of mouldering meat, singed hair and excrement.  He’d been starving for quite some time so gnawed voraciously.  It wasn’t long, however, before others also came.

The scrabble of feet caused his knocked ears to twitch and he stopped feasting.  A low growl erupted from the entrance of the tunnel behind him.  Turning around, the other rat’s teeth sunk deeply into the loose fur around his neck.  He bit hard on the would-be usurper’s foreleg and she squealed in pain as his incisors dug into bone.  She quickly backed out to search for another way in.  He sat breathing hard, growling until he’d settled enough to go back to the task at hand.

He knew there was something special somewhere in there.  He could hear other rats from above and on the sides searching as well, so he quickened his pace.

That’s when he found it: a bag of delectable delights.  He couldn’t see them at first, but the scent emanating from the sack was like ambrosia.  The Gods had indeed been good to him and he began scratching frantically at it.  It split and what spilt over him was a viscous, putrid liquid.  Once drained, however, the remnants of an Italian sub were his and his alone for long enough to sate him.  When the other starving rats joined him, he slunk away and curled up to sleep in a dark corner.

This particular sub came from a well-known local deli called Sullivan’s on Knight St.  It was Friday at 1:00pm and Sean, the owner, had an Italian sub waiting on the counter.  He kept peeking at it and the front door as he helped other customers with their orders.

Once the lunch crowd had settled down, he put his hand on the sandwich with a concerned look.  He shouted to his brother in the backroom.

“Hey, Mikey.  Margaret never came to get her order today.  I’m a little worried.”   

Margaret Millison always ordered an Italian sub on Wednesdays and Fridays.  She was so regular, that he always had it ready for her to pick up on those days.  She hadn’t missed a day since she opened the shop down the street five years ago.

“Ahh, she prolly just took a sick day.  Lord knows she deserves it,” piped his brother behind him.

“Come out front and watch the store.  I’m gonna go check,” he said, scooping up the sub.

He enjoyed the stretch.  It was a nice day and he took a deep breath.  *I’m sure it’s nothing*, he thought to himself.  He didn’t lie to himself, however.  He was worried.

As he approached her shopfront, he saw the lights were on.  *Perhaps, she just got busy after all.*

He stepped under the sign ***Milli’s Seamstress Shop,*** pushed the door open which rang the bell.

He rocked back shocked as the rats scurried quickly away from the sewer’s half devoured body.",1620730871.0
I’m so embarrassed,151,9,"I was never the social type growing up

I lived on a ranch with my mother and father far away from civilization. In fact, it took my dad half of a day to drive down and get supplies to keep us fed

With my family being so far away from anybody I wasn’t very good at talking to people or socializing 

I didn’t have any friends growing up since my mother homeschooled me until I was old enough to get a job to help support my family

So I got a job as a cashier at the local general store which was good since it was the one that my dad went to so he could get food on a discount since I worked there

I would have trouble socializing with the customers and always seemed to scare them away with my awkwardness 

Later on my boss saw that I was scaring away customers and warned me to start acting normal or he would fire me

So I tried to be social even harder so that I wouldn’t be embarrassed and humiliated 

Bur that just ended up scaring even more people away than before

So my boss told me that I was fired and told me to collect my things

Now I’m sitting in the courtroom as the lawyer reads off the medical report

“The owner of the store was found mutilated with over 28 stab wounds in his upper back”

Now the entire room is staring at me with their beady judging eyes thinking things about me like “what a monster”

The Census Man,34,4,"We have a lady in attic.

Her face is nothing but skin, vaguely contoured to suggest eye sockets and a nose, but far too smooth, far too featureless to be right. Her jaw hangs slack at all times, only closing when we spoon food into it.

We have no idea who she is. I thought she might have once been my mom. Dad thinks she was my sister. Or maybe a friend of the family? A cousin? There was no way to know. We were hiding from the Census Man and when he left, she was there drooling in the kitchen. She must have lived with us before then but we’ll never know for sure.

We feed her and bathe her and keep her wrapped up in jeans and old jackets. It’s the least we can do.

The Census Man comes around a lot, ten to fifteen times a year in no particular pattern. He’s always the same. A middle aged man with a handsome face under clean and combed hair. His khaki slacks and white dress shirt and navy blue blazer are always spotless. He’s never without his official looking clipboard.

Door to door, down the road, into every nook and cranny he goes. He tells us that all he wants is to take our names and he’ll go. Sometimes we hide. Sometimes we shoot him dead from ambush, though that’s always a dangerous solution and never one that lasts for long. Sometimes he actually finds someone, and then the family crawls out of the basement or the woods and finds a poor soul wandering their home without a name.

I’d like to give that the nameless, faceless, miserable woman (my mom?) in the attic a new name, but I don’t know if she could outrun the Census Man without eyes. It would probably break her heart to have her name taken again.",1620740518.0
I decided not to take my pills this morning.,29,4,"**BEEP BEEP BEEP**

I wake up to the alarm, *9 AM* I groan and sit up straight while rubbing my eyes. I get up and look down to see my pinky finger rapidly twitching, I hate this side effect of the pills so much, I hate everything about pills. The words **Hallucinations, Disorganized thinking,** and **Panic**, those words cross my mind and I remember once again why I have to take these pills. In about an hour the side effects will stop, still, I’m gonna have to take the pills right now, so what does it matter if it stops soon? No. I told myself **no**, today I’m not taking the pills, I don’t care if it kills me, I don’t care if I do something stupid, I’m done with the pills. After making up my mind about this I exit my room and go to the kitchen.

*“Hey darling”* My Mother says.

“Hey mom” I respond back

My mother visits me once in a while to see how I’m doing, I’ve always wondered if she would still visit me if I didn’t have this mental illness.

“*I came here early while you were asleep and made you a sandwich and some tea”* she says in a light-hearted caring voice.

*“Th-thanks mom..”*  a tired voice came out from me, with little to no sleep last night I’m not surprised.

*“Oh darling, you look very tired. You should be getting more sleep.”*

*“I..I know mom, I know. I’m fine I promise”*

*“Well, okay darling, just please take care of yourself and be safe. I’ll be on my way now.”*

She made her way out the door while I looked down at my sandwich and tea.

As I finished my meal, I start to seriously think about what will happen if I don’t take the pills. I know about the **Hallucinations, Disorganized thinking,** but none of those have ever been too bad. I think I’ll be fine. I walked passed the pills and went into my room.

I started skimming through the books I might want to read. Finally, I chose **“Apology”** which was written by Plato in 1841. Reading the book was calming I felt at ease, I felt free from the pills. These feelings were interrupted by loud a banging at my bedroom door. I jumped and looked up at the door, startled, I froze not knowing what to do. The door opened to reveal my mother hanging and a black figure fading away. The realization hit me, the sight was so disturbing I couldn’t look. Why? Why didn’t I take the pills, why? What was I trying to prove? I knew I had to go to the kitchen and get the pills, then the sight would go away. But I was too scared, I didn’t wanna the kitchen, I’m so scared. I know it will go away if I just go and take the pills, I don’t have it in me to get up and run. These thoughts were going so fast I was so scared, everything was happening so fast, **but then suddenly.** I felt my pinky twitching. I thought to myself “oh” My mother has always been very careful to make sure I take my pills.",1620741739.0
My dad never was an angel.,1699,63,"You know the type: gun nut, a little misogynistic; thinks women always vote for whoever is cutest. But funny. And more open minded than you'd think. Not a terrible person, just... What do they call that? Rough around the edges. That's it. So it was harder to tell with him, you know? Some people, you knew right away something was off. Or at least you chalked it up to a brain tumor or something. 

*What do you mean?*

Well, if a soft-spoken kindergarten teacher suddenly starts stockpiling ammo, people notice. With my dad, he just seemed to be getting gradually more paranoid. I don't know, like, turning into a grumpy old man I guess. 

*Uh-huh. And when did you realize something was wrong?*

The flat earth thing. God, what was it he sent me? ? Oh right, Chicago. A picture of the Chicago skyline. He said he didn't know if he believed it, but it ""didn't pass the sniff test"". You know, all the Obama stuff, the 'stolen election', even Hilary Clinton eating babies or whatever... Ok, I get it. Divisiveness and politics, yada yada. But then he started ranting about vaccines, flat earth, all of it. Like I said, my dad never was an angel. But he's not stupid.

You know what's genius about it though? It preys on critical thinking in a way; on that idea of ""reasonable doubt"". Things don't have to be true, just sound **kind of** reasonable. Have some **grain** of truth. Signs of autism show up at the same age that kids get vaccines, covid lined up pretty squarely with the election, there **is** an elitist Hollywood pedophile ring out there. So what does the conspiracy theorist do? Goes anti-vax, anti-mask, and shoots up pizza places. Like, it takes away the self- preservation instinct. 

*You think that's intentional? Actively predatory?*

I think so. You ever see a rat with the parasite that makes it suicidal? Toxoplasma-something? Or better yet, that ant with cordyceps. It climbs as high as it can so that spores can spread to the whole colony. What's Facebook but a giant tree to an ant, in this case?

Anyway, I was finally able to get him an appointment here. He was in the first wave, what was that like 7-8 million people? You guys were pretty booked up

*Yeah, it was a madhouse. Ok. Lab results are back and it looks like we'll start with a round of steroids and antifungals. I do have to warn you though, the damage done so far is irreversible*

I know, I get it. I'm ok with it. Like I said, my dad never was an angel. But that fungus digesting his brain has turned him into a real monster.",1620653127.0
Worthless,27,8,"It was a sunny Saturday, as Chloe was just sitting on her couch in the living room, waiting for her siblings Claire and Carlos to come. But she didn’t have to wait long, because right then and there, her sister Claire burst through the door.

*Claire. Mother of 2. CEO of a successful company. Lives in a beautiful mansion. Has pretty blonde hair and brown eyes.*

Chloe immediately ran to greet her as she gave her sister a big hug, but Claire just stood there, looking around the room.

“Chloe, the house...it looks like a pigsty.”

Chloe was taken aback by this comment. A pigsty? She didn’t expect her sister to be so harsh.

“Our photos are just there, on the floor. And they’ve slid out of their frames. Everything is out of place. The chandelier looks like it’s going to fall. And I thought you of all people would be able to keep our house in good shape.”

“Well, it’s just that I’ve been extremely busy these days...too busy, even.”

“And what’s your job?”

Chloe stayed silent.

“So you’re unemployed too?”

Chloe stayed silent again.

“I expected better from you. So what do you even do for a living? Sitting around watching birds? You’re worthless, honestly.”

“Carlos. I see you also decided to pay a visit to our worthless little sister?”

“You’re worthless. Your house is a complete mess. Your siblings don’t love you. Your family doesn’t care about you! Idiot.”

"I Promise, I Will Make This up to You",29,2,"I crouched down in front of the gravestone. *David Jones*, it read, and below that, *In Loving Memory 2008-2021*. In front of the marble block was a baseball, perfectly white except for where a dozen people had written their names in black sharpie.

*Carson Kents, Kenneth Baker, John lohti…* “I remember them,” I said, smiling and standing up.

I knew them all well, in fact. Well enough to know where each one of them lived.

If any one of them had shown up to my son's birthday party, he’d probably still be alive. And that coach… I turned the ball around in my hand until I found his name, *Gregory Moore.* He had the nerve to leave this here, like a trophy? Like baseball, and that team, were positive memories for my boy?

*Yeah, I know where you live too, Coach.*

“David, I love you and I'm sorry,” I said. “I will make this up to you.”

I brought the ball up to my mouth, so close that my lips left a dark red imprint. “Soon you’ll all be sorry,” I whispered.

I let the ball drop to the ground, then pulled out from my purse what I’d brought for my boy.

With my free hand, I pulled up as much grass and dirt as I could manage. Then, I buried the two bloody pieces of stretchy flesh that had once been the left and right cheeks on the Bradford Bulls starting shortstops face.

“Halfway there,” I said. “I promise, I will make this up to you.”",1620726321.0
Sacrifice,95,13,"Our parents always told us they'd be willing to sacrifice anything for the greater good of the family. When I was born, my mother decided to give up her promising career as a young architect to care for me, while my father increased his working hours as a mechanic. Still, he tried to spend as much of his free time as possible bonding with me and being a loving husband. Even after my brother and sister were born and he expanded his working hours into the weekends, he gave us as much attention and love as he could muster.

That is, until the accident happened. While driving to his job, dad got struck by a someone running a red light. He was severely injured, and since he refused to spend the money he'd been saving for us on his own hospital bills, he developed a limp and his right arm never fully healed. In turn, he was unable to work as much as he used to, and as he wouldn't allow mom to take up a job while also caring for us, our total income started dropping quickly.

Dad had always been a very rational man with an interest in science, but after the accident he suddenly seemed to be drawn into conspiracy theories. Especially the one about the local forest seemed to fascinate him: families would leave one of their own, usually their oldest child, in the forest, and would return with some kind of gift. Whether these gifts came from fey or a cult of rich cannibalists differed depending on the storyteller, but most adults simply didn't believe the stories regardless. My father wasn't like most adults.

One day, he promised me and my siblings a trip to the zoo. Because it was still early in the morning, I fell asleep on the way there, but when I woke up I was surprised to find ourselves surrounded by trees. I couldn't see the route we had taken, and I knew I would get lost if I tried to run. So instead, I tried to keep my calm as my father took the lead deeper into the woods. 

After some time, we crossed a crooked bridge leading to a small hut. My father ushered my siblings inside and locked the door behind them with a beam. As we turned back around, something was standing on the bridge. The shadows of the canopy concealed its details, but the form was that of a tall, bald man, and I could swear I saw two white orbs staring in our direction. My father started limping to the bridge as it stretched out a white hand. Dad took the hand, and together the two disappeared into the forest. After overcoming my shock, I tried running after them, but I stopped halfway on the bridge as my foot hit something. I looked down to see a large, slightly ajar briefcase, as specks of light lit the many stacks of bills hidden inside.",1620692548.0
an ode to mercy,9,0,"To me she was more than another pretty little head smashed open on the pavement. So much more than pulverized bones and grey matter plastered 531 feet below the Newport Tower. 

She was beautiful. She was wise beyond her years. But more than that she was human. 

She was everything I could never be. I’m a liar; I’m the scumbag that promised to wrap her pain and suffering up in a pretty little bow. I’m the one that never delivered.

I’m the one who fed her broken promises. I’m the one that swore on my shitty little life we’d climb thirty seven stories high, hand in hand together, and make that leap of faith. We’d float in serenity before our skulls decorated the street ruby red. 

I’m the one who said we’d be angels together, yet it was I who didn’t show. 

I can see her now, restored to her former beauty. Beautifully breathtaking. She smiles now, but it is not kind. 

I blink, and it is gone. 

I’m staring at the void where her frontal lobe should be. Her pretty smile is twisted. Her jaw is a mere hinge hanging off of her eviscerated cheeks. 

Her face, hollowed and gaunt. It leers at me. 

I only pray she shows me mercy.",1620737719.0
What Was Actually In The Old House,4,1,"No matter if it did or didn't deserve it, the house at the end of 5th Street was destined to become a thing of supernatural legend. It had all the classical makings of a haunted house. It's style was Victorian. It was in a state of significant decay. The fact that a terrible murder had taken place there was just the point on the witch's hat.

Those days, no matter which local one talked to, all of them seemed to know at least one story about the house. The most popular was the one about the ghost of an old woman being seen in the window. Another one spoke about a family who had lived there and had been scared away. And sometimes one could hear about the statues in the courtyard getting up and dancing about.

But as far as my friends and I knew, no one had actually been inside the place since its shuttering. With all the rot, number of pests and other such things which had built up inside it, it had probably become too dangerous. Of course, as in love as we were with ghosts and all matters of paranormal subjects, these were the least possible things we believed the house could be filled with. Instead, in our minds and discussions, we filled the house with all kinds of ghosts, monsters, and aliens. And for a long while these imaginings were enough to keep us satisfied.

Eventually, however, our curiosity about the place became too strong. Without asking our parents for permission, we snuck out one night and met in front of the house. Using a crowbar, we quickly made our way inside. Eagerly we ducked and scurried among the old furnishings and up and down the stairs and into all the rooms. Our taunts, shrieks, and poundings echoed off the old walls as we attempted to draw out whatever creatures lurked in the place. 

But once we had run out of energy and breath, we settled down and realized just how quiet the place was. We glanced at each other nervously and began discussing the possibility that there was nothing there. Someone suggested that maybe the horrors just weren't interested in us that night. But, as heartbreaking as it was, most of us believed that there was nothing in the house. And, most dismally, a few of us questioned if the paranormal existed at all.",1620753510.0

##---

Frimps, Oil and Bogota were ransacking the Church of the Blessed Redeemer as Vi sat outside in the Civic, engine running, radio on but not too loud, not loud enough to drown out the sounds of something happening.

So far nothing had happened.

But Vi didn't have a good feeling about this one. They were supposed to be doing a mom-and-pop, but Frimps had changed his mind at the last minute and here they were. ""Fucking *believers*,"" he'd said. ""They don't even lock their doors. Do you know how much shit they have in there?""

On the radio a song ended and a PSA came on, something about people in need, children, waiting for organ donations, some kind of priest talking about goodness in our hearts…

Something happened—

There was a circular stained glass window above the main doors to the church *and Oils came crashing through it!*

Hitting the pavement, legs bent sideways and a fucking sword driven through his chest.

""Oh, shit!""

Vi blinked, and:

The stained glass window was intact and the sword was gone, but Oils was still there.

Vi rolled down the window.

""What the fuck, Oils?""

He looked up at her with flames for eyes and a rattlesnake tail for a tongue: *rattle-rattle-rattle*...

""The *fuck*?""

Vi changed gears into reverse—

Frimps and Bogota—

**blasted** out the front doors of the church—

One came through the windshield, face carved up; the other made a massive dent in the roof.

""Drive,"" Oils hissed, *his face blinking on and off.*

Vi hit the accelerator, reversing out of the parking lot—tires squealing! Then: into drive: gunning it down the street, sweaty hands shaking.

The rearview:

*A ten-foot tall glowing angel crystallizing as light.*

The dead body in the car shifting, head rotating one-hundred eighty degrees. ""Your body is a temple of the Lord.""

Bang-bang-*banging* on the roof.

The angel growing: gaining, and Vi forcing everything she could out of the engine.

*Fish-tail-ing*

Blasting through red lights.

*Horns!*

Then the back of the car lifted into the air—

*The angel lifting it.*

—world spinning: Vi separating from it: held by the angel: angel of mercy: angel of death:

Darwinism,29,2,"""Wonderful,"" I muttered as the instant ramen I was absentmindedly cooking boiled over.

I shut off the burner, and with a quick snap, the broth on the stove stopped its uncontrollable bubbling. I placed the lid over the pot and turned around, ready to begin tonight's usual mountain of assignments. 

As I stared at the blank television screen, a sudden noise startled me out of my chair.

I was trying to remember if I had locked my door when I saw her. As I tried to comprehend the situation I was in, a detail about her jarred me out of my thoughts. 

She was green.

She spoke before I could. 

""Before you panic, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Celia. 

I am human.""

For some reason, I believed her. As she was speaking, I noticed even more about her.

Her legs looked similar to a dog's. Her eyes and nose were bigger, too. She had more arm joints: three rather than one on each arm. Her fingers also had an extra knuckle each. She was much taller than me, which is only surprising since I'm '5 ""8. Her skin was not only green, I noticed, but translucent, too. I could see silvery veins moving beneath her skin, and it was hypnotic. 

Despite her strange appearance, she was beautiful.

She spoke again.

""I am from another dimension. Another Earth. On my Earth, humanity evolved... *differently*. Our skin contains chlorophyll. Hunger on my Earth is nonexistent. Our bones are longer and more compact, and extra joints make for great flexibility. Our legs are built now to run, though we retain our endurance. I can also see much better than you do.""

I believed her completely. But I was doubtful. ""Then why are you here? Your Earth sounds like a utopia,"" I said.

She stepped closer.

""I came to witness what we would be if we destroyed our planet.""

She backed me against the wall, her face contorted in an unknown emotion.

I tried to strike her, but she caught me, the extra muscles in her arm bulging.

She regained control of herself and backed away. 

""My anger is not why I'm here."" She whispered.

""Why are you here, then?"" I tested.

She smiled, and I noticed sharper canines and squarer incisors. ""I'm here for the sake of my home. I was sent here by our leaders.""

""A diplomat?"" I asked.

""No. A revolutionary.""

With those words, she pounced, pinning me to the floor of my apartment.

""We can't feel things. Physically. We have emotion, but things like texture and temperature are nonexistent. We are lonely, unable to feel the touch or warmth of those we care about. Our researchers figured that we evolved without the sensory nerves that you humans did, and they were right.""

""I was sent to bring back a sample. Living or dead.""

Suddenly, I knew which one I was going to be.

""You will better my people. Be thankful. 

We must be perfect.

At all costs.""",1620705465.0

Pressure,39,3,"“Just ten more pounds. It’ll be a new personal record for you Brian!”

“I don’t know man.... I’m really not feeling it.” 

Brian and Alex were the last two at the gym, wrapping up the day with the bench press.

“Just give it a shot, one rep then we can call it a night. I’ll spot you.”

It always seemed impossible to deny him when he got his mind set. 

“Fine, fine....” Brian muttered stretching his arms and laying back on the bench as his friend smiled and slid on a few more plates. “Just one shot and be ready, I barely got the last one up so I really don’t know about this.”

“Yea yea, no worries I’ve got faith in you.”

Both pair of hands gripped the bar. 

“1....” 

“2....”

“3!”

They lifted together then Brian took the full weight. His arms shook as the bar slowly lowered to his chest. 

As it touched Brian’s chest Alex kept his hands on the bar, looking ready to take the weight at the first sign of struggle. 

Brian exhaled heavily as he pushed and the bar began to inch up.

A smile crept across his face as he thought he might just be able to do this.

About halfway up he felt he had hit a brick wall. 

The weight was stopped and he struggled. He huffed “....Alex...!”

“Don’t worry bud I got you.”

The bar began to lower and Brian felt as if it were getting heavier.

“...The hell!?” Brian coughed still trying to press it up.


The bar continued to lower and was inches from Brian’s chest but Alex continued to push it down. 

“C’mon man just push.” Alex said calmly.

Brian’s vision was going blurry. He couldn’t make out Alex’s face, and when he tried to tip the bar to roll out from under it he felt it pin his chest to the bench.

“You’re never going to get strong like that...” 

The bar continued on its slow methodical drop. 

Brian’s ribs did nothing to stop it. 

Bones cracked and flesh tore as the bar was slowly pushed inch by inch through Brian’s torso. His heart and lungs were mangled in bone fragments as the bar caved them all farther down.

One cough of blood left his mouth before the bar touched the bench and came to a rest.",1620695511.0
A Bad Word,22,4,"  

I love to read. I’ll read anything. Doesn’t matter what it is. Novels, newspapers, ad copy, textbooks, poetry – I don’t care. I just like words. It’s why I became a lexicographer. I write dictionaries. Not much thought is paid to the flesh and blood humans who spend their lives poring over forests worth of text to tease out the best possible definitions of words.

Sometimes we get childish e-mails about words we put in our dictionaries saying things like “You can’t put that in the dictionary! It’s a bad word!” or “That’s not a real word! It’s just made up!”…But *all* words are made up. Spoken, signed, or written, words are just arbitrary noises, hand signals, or scribbles. Words have meaning, of course, and sometimes power, but they are not born with those things. They acquire them over time and repeated usage. There are bad ways to use words but no word is bad in and of itself…At least, that’s what I thought until I encountered one.

A new defining batch – the words I would be working on for this portion of our new edition – was waiting for me at work. I took the batch folder to my desk and opened it. It contained only one word. This was not entirely unusual. English is a messy language and some words can be very tricky. It had taken me nine months to define “run” in our last edition. But this word was different.

Lexicographers have what we call “Sprachgefühl” – a German word literally meaning “language feeling.” It’s a sort of linguistic spidey sense of how a word functions; how it’s meant to be used…and my Sprachgefühl was ablaze as I looked at this word. Despite having never before encountered it, I felt what it meant and I shivered.

The word made sense when I looked at it but it seemed to churn and crawl on the page. It was comprised of letters from the Latin alphabet but did it start with an “e” or a “g”? Or a “y”? How many letters did it contain? I couldn’t say for sure. It was a new entry. No other editors had worked on it before. There were no citation files to reference. Now that I looked at the batch page, I wasn’t even sure which of the senior editors had assigned it to me. But that didn’t matter. It didn’t matter if it was my job or not. From the instant I laid eyes on it, I knew I would define this unknowable word.

I wish I could tell you how long it took for me to finish that definition, but I don’t really know myself. The best I can do is to say that it took a second’s worth of eternities. What I do know is that when I typed the final letter of the final word of the final page of that definition, the sun and all of the stars, known and unknown, simply blinked out into nothing. All was void.",1620695097.0
I'm trying to change my DNA,9,2,"What have I done! 

I pushed Rodger down the stairs after a scuffle over a petty argument over who owes what in terms of money. His body lay at the bottom of the stairs and seeing him all lifeless was unnerving. I was just screaming in my mind for him to get up and do something random to free me of the realisation of what I had done. I have committed murder. How life changes and the tides turn so quickly against me. My potential and future literally gone within my grasp. I ran home and I guess I was never to set foot at that university ever again. Luckily no body else was around and I was disgusted at my own selfishness as I only cared for myself in this situation. 

Then I thought about my DNA on Rodgers body and I started to freak out. I wasn't thinking straight at all and I wanted to scream but nothing was coming out. For some reason out of pure desperation I had gotten the idea that I could change the DNA on my hand by getting a knife and slicing my skin and making patterns. It hurt and I took the pain as I was slicing and creating cut lines on my hand as I was just trying to change my DNA, when you are desperate you go crazy I guess. 

I went back to the place where I pushed Rodger and luckily no one has still found out what I had done. I started touching Rodgers dead body with my cut up hands as I was hoping to give off new DNA to cover up my other DNA which I originally touched him with, it's crazy I know and when the moment came where I realized I was completely off the plot, I then finally with such relief I managed to scream. The scream coming out of me brought back some logic in me and I knew as I had always known that you can't change your DNA by cutting up your own hands. 

I turn started to then burn my hand with fire to change my DNA and I even used acid, my hands looked atrocious now but at least my DNA won't be on Rodgers body anymore. Hold on that can't be right man my head's spinning out of control and I can't think straight, and these ideas are completely against who I am and what I know to be true scientific fact. One thing I do know and completely clear of is that I am a murderer and I murdered Roger.",1620710029.0
It's Just the Night Light,216,25,"The light flickered and then went out.  Max yelled for his mother and she came quickly.

“Don’t worry, honey.  It’s just the nightlight.”  Her reassuring voice calmed him, but he clung to her robe as she went to grab batteries out of the junk drawer downstairs.  He sucked his thumb the whole way.  She looked sideways at him doing it, but let it go this time.  He needed it and she understood.  Under normal circumstances she would have gently pulled it out of that comfortable spot on the roof of his mouth saying, “We need to learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable.”

Back in the room, she changed the batteries and the soft glow of his Eeyore nightlight emanated.  He was a sickly child and felt very different from all the other kids.  It was no wonder to her that he connected with the melancholy donkey more than any of the other cartoon characters that were pinned up and stuck to the walls.  She brushed his hair gently and cupped his face and hummed his favorite song:  Rock a bye baby.  He put his hand on hers and said, “No, mama.”  She stopped.

She stared into his bright, hazel eyes and continued stroking his head until they began fluttering.  When his body started twitching lightly- a telltale sign that someone has begun sleeping- she got up and went back to bed.

Time went on and Max grew.  Watching your children grow is heartbreakingly bitter sweet.  Gone were the days of Max needing her to change batteries.  Eeyore and the rest were replaced by mountain bikes and he had grown out of his ailments.  And while her heart yearned for that baby who clung tightly to her robe and sucked his thumb, she was proud that he shared with her the best moments of his adult life:  when he became an astronomer,  when he found a good woman to marry and when their children were born.

When they surrounded her on her deathbed and she smiled with such strong, loving devotion, she cried.  She wept her final tears with an aching heart for the life that she never missed and yet missed being in so dearly.  He held her hand and gently brushed her hair just like she’d done for him when her chest stopped rising.

Max continued down his path and visited her grave as often as possible.  When he was home, his concentration was on raising good kids and when at work, doing a good job.

One day, something odd at work happened.  A star he’d been watching wasn’t there anymore.  He searched for a long time, but it was just the first.  By the time his findings has circulated amongst his peers, thousands of stars were disappearing by the second.  It was discovered that a black hole was approaching Earth at unknown speeds.

A Thicket of Legs,21,1,"I hadn’t seen the sun in months. Not properly. Too little, you see? All of us little ones had the same lot. We wandered through the stinking filth below while the big ones got the sun. At least we got to move, and truthfully, I didn’t usually mind the stench much. “Like pigs in a pen,” a big one once said, stepping on my hand as I crawled beneath. I guess he was right, whatever a pig was. 

I crawled through the crowded thicket of legs with Josie and Puck, dodging stumbles and squeezing through the stems of the odd chair that still remained. Now mind you, *this* was a brave endeavor. Wood rotted in the filth and an intact chair always had some fat foodgrabber standing atop it. A crushed chair meant a crushed little one if they happened to be beneath it, and they’d be forgotten in the filth, rotting themselves until the next rain came. 

“Red skirt!” Josie called, shouting behind, her high voice cutting through the dull, persistent groan of the big ones overhead. 

It was really more of a muddy blood than proper red. Not like the hair barrette my lifegiver had lent me once. We understood all the same. *Brown skinny legs, knee-hole pants, red skirts.*. They were the markers we used, so as to find our way. 

Red skirt had a little one in her belly. The space she made gave Josie, Puck and me a chance to rest and plan our next moves. 

“How far now?” Puck asked. 

Josie had seen a wall when she was younger. You could hear the big ones talk about it if you got lucky. *Too high to climb* they’d always agree, but Josie had also seen a tunnel. The place where the bones and filth went when the rain washed it all away. 

“Not far I think, maybe a hundred big folk flowward. Just past the one-leg with the metal stick.”  Lasting markers were a rarity, and we didn’t find the one-leg, but we found the stick. ‘A crutch,’ my mind told me. A memory from my lifegiver before she set me down. 

Sure enough we found the wall, and found the tunnel too. A sharp-rocked hole no wider than a big one’s stride. We crawled through shifting bones and rotting flesh, but on the other side, sunlight and blue sky...I couldn’t remember ever seeing something so bright and clear.  There wasn’t filth neither, just short hairs growing from the ground in a color I’d never seen. Like pretty bile or Josie’s eyes. 

And then I saw them. 

Not like the big ones—bigger. Much bigger.  Their bloody hands chasing big ones trying to flee, their teeth chomping and shredding, spilling viscera across the ground. 

We had heard the distant screams from time to time, but screams were common in the endless crowd. Wasn’t much to think about. For some odd reason, all I *could* think was that cryptic phrase, “Like pigs in a pen.”",1620682208.0
The Desperation Of A Stuffed Armadillo,43,10,"There are many beliefs among toys about what happens when we’re thrown away. Some of us believe that we either go to a heavenly place where we’re never mistreated again or a hell where we're always mistreated. Others believe that when humans are done with us we're just thrown into a big fire and we disappear completely. 

But I didn’t pay much attention to any of these legends back then. All they did was remind me that I would die one day. And I was willing to do anything to make sure that didn’t happen. Even if it meant hurting a child. 

Around the time that I met Sarah, I knew she was going to be my last kid. It was weird that she had even accepted me. I had gotten up there in years. My fur was mostly gone, half my stuffing was missing, and I was covered in patches. I also had this really weird smell on me that just wouldn’t go away. 

But as Sarah had been very poor for a long time, she knew her mother couldn't get her anything better. And she knew she was lucky to even have me. So, she not only played with me like I was a newer armadillo, she also did not mistreat me like other children had. I was not thrown around, stained, ripped, left on the floor, abandoned, or, most importantly, thrown away. It was heaven. 

That is, until Sarah’s mother found a rich husband who lifted her out of poverty. That meant that I was no longer good enough for them. Almost every week, Sarah’s mother told Sarah that she needed to throw me out. For the first few months after moving into their new house, Sarah would protest. But then, as she got newer and more beautiful toys, her protests became weaker. At one point, she stopped playing with me altogether. 

I knew that I had to act fast. One day when Sarah was in the shower, I snuck up behind and tripped her. She fell backwards and bashed her skull against the tile. It was enough to give her brain damage and reduce her to an infantile state. 

Her new stepfather had enough money to make sure that she received the best of care. But that didn’t help her live an ordinary life. Sarah spends most of her time in a care home with other special persons now. And, as her parents believed she still loved me, I was sent along in order to give her some comfort. It was everything I could've wanted. I got all that time alone with her. 

But I quickly realized that she was no longer the Sarah who treated her toys with respect. In fact, the treatment that I receive from her now is the worst that I've ever known. I am chewed on, thrown around, ripped apart, and much more. I keep telling myself this is better than being thrown away and isn't hell. It hasn't worked yet.",1620665519.0
"Ah, spring",14,1,"So I stopped and smelled the roses and the goddamned thing bit me. I'm going to assume I'm being litteral calling it god damned. Some god damned it. However I'm not litteral about it being a rose...I actually stopped and smelled the daffodils. Regardless of species *the son of a bitch bit me.*

""God dammit!"" I shouted, followed by a muttered ""Garbage bag"" while stepping on it. 

And it bit me again, right through my shoe. Like, bitemarks on my toes right through my shoe. Workboots to be precise. 

Of course, I screamed and ripped off my shoe. As I pulled the sock half my toe ripped off, causing, beleive it or not, a louder scream. One of those high pitched 'was that *me* making that sound??' screams. 

On the ground I stared at the yellow daffodil in disbelief as I took my phone out to call 911. Blood was straight up gushing and I wasn't going to be able to hop anywhere what with the intense pain and all. 

My hands were shaking and heart was hammering as I opened up the phone app. I clenched my eyes shut trying to block out how both confused and hurt I was, and as soon as I did the phone was slapped out of my hand. Hard. I opened my eyes and saw I had a deep papercut-like slit from the middle of my thumb and forefinger all the way across the top of my hand. 

Looking at the daffodil I saw blood covering the edge of its leaves. My eyes were drawn back over to the flowers center and there I saw an eye. This angry hazel eye staring at me, the petals forming a menacing eyebrow of sorts. It maintained eye contact and I felt my hand go to my foot and yank the toe off. 

I felt my hand do this...I absolutely did NOT make the conscious decision to do so. 

It took a couple yanks and I yelled and I pulled and I screamed and it released. And then I tossed my toe at the daffodil and the fucking eye had a mouth in the middle that showed itself as my toe sailed over to it. My toe was consumed by the mouth in the eye in the flower. 

Have you ever seen an eyeball *chew* before? 

HAVE YOU? 

My toe blood ran down the petals as the eye angrily glared at me, chewing. 

And then... it was gone. No eye, just a simple yellow flower glistening with my blood.",1620685820.0

Yeah yeah yeah. Glock possibly? That’s only one I know. All black and pistol-like. And there’s one of those name plates on the desk too. Has ‘Peter’ inscribed on it I think.

*My name’s Peter.*

Oh, sorry. It might have said ‘Peterson’.

*That’s my last name.*

You fucking kidding me? Peter Peterson?

*Yeah.*

Well, alrighty then. Anyway, the name plate definitely said ‘Peter Peterson’, and now you notice something *really* weird.

*What?*

Everything is in black and white, isn’t it? There’s no color. It’s all black and white and gray.

*And I’m seeing this? I’m there?*

Yeah, you’re there alright, watching it all unfold. Peter Peterson picks up the gun from the desk, and looks at it weirdly.

*Weirdly?*

Yeah, yeah, it’s like he hasn’t seen a gun before. Like he doesn’t know how to handle it. He lets it dangle awkwardly mid-air between the thumb and index. And then, when he brings it closer to his face, I suppose maybe to get a better look at it…

*Yeah?*

Well, he drops it, doesn’t he? Shouldn’t have done that, you realise. Should *not* have done that.

*Why?*

It goes off the moment it contacts the desk. Single violent bullet through his brain. 

*Wow, that’s messed up!*

Sure is man, sure is. You know the worst part?

*No?*

He doesn’t die. You see, there are parts of the brain you can live without, like the cerebellum. You’ll probably be all fucked up for the rest of your life though, eating vegetables through straws or something.

*Damn...That’s dark.*

Not as dark as Peter Peterson's remaining existence though. His wife hightails out of there soon after you see. Packs up her shit and leaves him dying a slow agonizing death, trapped inside his own body. Fucker lives forever too, dies at the ripe old age of sixty something. At the end there’s nothing left of his sanity. He’s eaten it all, fed on it, suckled it all up. Thirty-something years imprisoned in your own fucked up, decaying mind. Imagine that.

*Shit.*

Anyway, thanks for the coffee stranger. I’ll pay you back for it when I find that goddamn wallet. You have my word.

*Don’t mention it, fella. I’ll see ya around.*

And so I leave Peter Peterson behind, having just weaved his demise down to the tiniest detail. It ain’t a pretty job, but the spouses tend to pay me well. I spice things up a bit though. Just having them drop dead seems like such a waste.

Seems like you gotta have some fun with fates.",1620596955.0
The Naming Game,1144,37,"My daughter, Sadie, is...unique. Some might even say ‘peculiar’ or ‘strange’ even. I tend to shy away from terms like that, because I don’t want her to develop a complex. She already went through enough with the death of her mother a few years back. 

My wife had been attacked while she was jogging, and after I told Sadie the police had given up on the case, she sort of shut down. I never saw her cry.  She only asked me why people die. I did my best with that one. ‘They die because it’s their time to move on to someplace different.’  Something like that. 

She didn’t talk for months after my explanation. And then one day, out of nowhere, the naming game started. She would sing a little rhyme to herself and place stones in a little pile in front of her. The song never repeated, but it reminded me of one of those playground rhymes. 

*One for the postman, one for his mutt, one for the pastor who called her a slut.*

I talked to a children’s therapist about it, and she said that it may just be Sadie’s way of organizing people she comes across, accounting for those who are living so that she can separate her mother’s death from the rest of her life. 

It seemed a reasonable enough explanation. The stones were her neighbors, her community, like abstract dolls in a children’s play set. 

When our mailman had a heart attack, I tried to relate it back to my explanation of death. He had moved on to someplace different, too. Then his dog, a friendly old border collie mix, was hit by a car right in front of our house. Sadie just kept singing. 

*One for the grocer, one for the nurse, one for the digger who leaned on the hearse.*

When Reverend Mitchell, the pastor at our church, choked to death on a sandwich in the rectory, I started to wonder about the naming game. It seemed eerily coincidental, and she sang it constantly. 

*One for O’ Riley and one for his son*.

“Sadie?”

*One for the poster who’s quick with a pun*. 

“Sadie, where did you learn this game?”

*One the newsman and one for his crew*. 

“Sadie! Goddamnit, who taught you this game?!”

*One for a jogger who—*.

“Sadie!”

She stopped, looking up at me with cold eyes.

“Sadie, baby, who taught you the naming game?”

Her gaze was still, emotionless, “Mommy did, after she went to someplace different.”

“And who are all the people in the rhymes?”

Her eyes hardened ever so slightly.  I could see the faintest hint of hatred bloom.  

“People who comforted the man who killed mommy.” 

She placed a final stone. 

“A jogger. Who looked like *you*.”",1620593960.0
Regression,94,4,"My second month of life was nothing short of revelatory. I was able to raise my head, and stare at the ceiling fan. I was eating and pooping, sleeping and crying. 

I was also remembering. Just as hypnosis has allowed me to remember these innocent days, I remember me remembering even earlier days. 

It’s not a past life, I don’t think. Actually, my two month old brain isn’t capable of much thinking at all. Instead, it’s as if I am looking through a vivid scrapbook from...before. 

In this “before” I don’t have a body. I’m just sort of floating out in some indistinct place. It’s very bright, blinding really. 

And I’m not alone. Lots of us there, balls of light. Is this heaven? Am I looking at souls?

Two month old me begins to cry. Grownup me, on this therapist’s couch begins to cry, too, but I don’t know why.  The hypnotist asks me to describe the feeling, and I hear myself gasp one word:  “Hide”

Then, as if one page in this pre-life scrapbook flips to another, I see the coming horror. It is violating the sea of light. It is the eater of souls. The Eater Of Souls. No version of myself—the grownup, the baby, the ball of light, can comprehend it. 

It is...dense. Heavy and black, and it comes for the souls. Infinite lights begin to be snuffed out, and it comes for me. 

Some of us go the only place we can hide, into bodies. These bodies. 

Two month old me shrieks to remember. Grownup me gasps and sits up, fully awake.  It is still out there, eating. 

I came here to recover the joy of my childhood. I leave a certain knowledge of what’s to come. After this life is over, there is nowhere to hide. It is waiting. Still waiting for me.",1620642363.0
The Plague Doctor,40,4,"I live in a small town. And every small town has its monster. The one that will take you away in a sack if you don’t eat your food, the one that will haunt you at night if you don’t sleep early. We have one too. We call him the Plague Doctor.

He comes at night, like a shadow, with a beaked mask and a cloak that makes him one with the dark. He lingers outside your house, a briefcase in hand, listening if anyone is awake. As the clock strikes twelve, he sneaks into your house and kills everybody inside, children last. Then he opens his briefcase and frees the rats inside, who will gnaw at anything they see – from your couch, your clothes, to your corpse.

And that is supposed to make children sleep. It’ll give them nightmares, that’s for sure. But I’m not scared of him. It’s just an old wives tale supposed to scare children into obeying their parents. He isn’t real at all.

Every night I go to bed peacefully, knowing that nobody is going to sneak into my room at night to kill me and feed my body to rats. It’s just a hoax.

*I hear footsteps outside my room. They stop at the door. The door opens slowly, making a faint, creaking sound.*

But it’s just a made-up story. There’s no such thing as a Plague Doctor.

*I see a silhouette at my door. It’s wearing a cape, a cloak perhaps. I see it has a very big nose. Almost like a …like a beak.*

But I’m not a child. I’m too old to be scared of a make-believe monster supposed to scare babies.

*I hear his voice. A low, raspy voice, muffled as if it’s coming through a mask.*

*“Bye, sweetie.”*

*“Be back soon, Dad...”*

But I don’t fear him. He can’t hurt me. After all, he isn’t real.

Is he?",1620658378.0
Don't Touch Your Oven,11,2,"This happened to me a few years ago, when I was 21 and living on my own in a small apartment, this apartment was very cheap, and quite comfortable. My college was 20 minutes away from here so that is why I chose to live here.

After a long day of studying for my upcoming exams, I decided to go take a shower and fall asleep.

*I woke up with a shiver down my spine*

I had a blood-curdling dream.

I was trapped in an empty room, with white walls and a popcorn ceiling, there weren't any doors that could lead me to an exit, there was nothing in this room, except an old oven, it was rusty, it looked like it hadn't been used for years and years.

Suddenly, a woman, an old woman, with thick curly hair, appeared in the oven, her head kept moving in circles, with blood pouring down her cheeks, she wasn't screaming, she was *saying* something, it sounded like gibberish, her voice was deep. 

That was the scariest dream I have ever had. I decided to just forget about it and continue on with my day, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that there was something wrong with my oven.

At around 10PM I arrived home, I was extremely tired, and hungry, so I decided to re-heat the leftover food I had last night, as I was about to turn on the oven I saw the woman, the same woman from my dream, I froze.

This time, she looked even scarier, her eyeballs were missing, blood was pouring down from her hollow sockets and she just said one thing

A Vampire's First Kill,187,6,"After months of effort, I’m ready for my first hunt. My rite of passage to become a full vampire. It didn’t take long to find suitable prey. I first noticed her jogging by my house every Saturday evening, always in the same crimson tracksuit. I carefully observed and analyzed her route, the same every week. Luckily for me, her run takes her through a pedestrian underpass tunnel. The tunnel didn’t get much traffic and was long enough and curved in such a way as to provide sufficient seclusion for my purposes. 

Finally, the night to execute my plan arrives I wait in the tunnel for my moment to strike. There’s a large pillar in the middle of the tunnel, providing ample cover for a surprise attack. At 7:33pm, a bit later than usual, I hear the familiar rhythmic tapping of a single pair of sneakers hitting concrete. It’s a precise sound I now know by heart. In an instant the moment came. I lunge at her as she passes me, tackling her to the ground. I salivate as I lay eyes on her exposed neck. I will finally taste blood for the first time. I will finally realize my destiny.

Without further delay, I sink my canines into her jugular, feeling the spray of warm blood on my face. I eagerly let the blood flow into my mouth and slide down my gullet. As my prey’s body goes limp, I feel the initial rush of adrenaline give way to a certain sinking feeling.

As I cough up a mouthful of bitter, metallic fluid, and feel my stomach churn, a few thoughts enter my head. Thoughts I hadn’t allowed myself to think for months. As I hear a shriek and turn my head to see a terrified group of witnesses, these thoughts burn at the front of my mind.

“Maybe the doctors were right,” I hear myself think, “maybe I’m not a vampire.”",1620621556.0
I am investigating a case.,14,3,"The day wasn't anything special, I couldn't sleep and had been sitting on my porch huffing cigarettes since 3 AM. I am a detective at the towns PD. It had been raining all night and little streams of rain drops still snaking along the glass encasement. My morning alarm went off, so went inside to turn it off.

My phone rang. Some guy was obstructing traffic at the town outskirts. I got dressed and got out to my car, my daughter Cathy is already all ready and waiting for me in the backseat with her favorite teddy bear to go along.

She was up early today, I told her to get back in the house since it was quite far where I was going. She denied, said she didn't want to be alone in that house because she's scared. I had no choice but to take her along.

I pull up at the scene. A guy is standing like a statue smack right in the middle of the road. Couple of civilians are making noises at him, I horn and holler at him, he ain't budging. He seemed unarmed, so i approach him slowly and gave him a little shake, he looked like a deer in headlights. He just stares scared at me, I asked him who he was, no answer. I asked him where he was from, he points to the house behind him, half a furlong away.

I started walking towards the house, I started getting an intense gut feeling. I grab my side arm and start approaching the house. The sun hit something near the garage, As i looked, a pool of blood is flowing down from behind the door. I immediately run back, I screamed at Cathy to get back in and lock herself up. I screamed so loud even the bystanders ran and hid in their cars. I immediately haul dispatch and forensics.

As they opened the garage, it was the one of the most horrific things I have seen, human remains ground like meat and smeared all over the walls, a nauseating bloody mess. The team finds at least 3 victims sent through a bloody wood chipper. I send the guy off into inquiry. I get back to my car. Cathy immediately says she knows what happened. She told me not to worry because the kids were asleep and they didn't feel much. She also said there was also a baby we missed. She was right.

My partner pulls up, says what a mess it is. Asks what am I gonna do, I said I was gonna process it all up and then spend time with my daughter as I had my vacation days coming up. He tells me I need to move on again, that Cathy's been dead a long time. But I disagree, She may be dead for the rest of 'em, but My little girl is as alive as ever for me, she'll always be my side, like she's now.",1620668787.0
Cinema on Main Street,12,1,"Heavy rain crackling on the pavement, the neon lights mirrored off of cars passing through. While we were walking I counted three streetlights before I heard her again.

“Won’t you give me a kiss, handsome?”

I stooped down and couldn’t help but smile as her lips were on mine. As she exhaled I could feel the drops of water moving away from our noses, and her porcelain hand on my cleanly shaven face. Hearing someone walking by, I pulled away. Her pure eyes creased as she smiled thinly. The footsteps stopped.

Looking right, I saw the unholiest man. Noticing my reaction, she turned as he ripped the leather purse from her shoulder and kicked her into the street.

I heard sliding, a hollow thud, and a horn blaring as a cold barrel was pressed into my shirt.

“Give me your money, bitch.”

His breath smelled like halitosis. I reached into my pockets quickly and heard a click, followed by ringing and the back of my head hitting the brick wall. I felt a neutral trickle down my shirt and sucking around my kidney. Clutching my side, I had to cough, blood was dripping from my mouth to my chest. I slid to the floor and watched him walk into the alley. Closing my eyes, I realized I had been shot.

I sunk my toes into the dry, warm, and smooth crystalline sand. Staring into the horizon, I could see what almost looked like an oil painting with the contrast of a raging campfire in twilight. The sun sunk below the waves, and the tide came up onto shore past the rocks. My feet were wet, and I was cold. I looked behind me and saw blackness. The roaring of the waves merged with low pitched humming. As I opened my eyes I heard a beep.

A second beep. As I looked towards my stomach, I saw a nurse typing on a laptop. He turned towards me with almost the same look my mother gave me when I’d come home from school. I was alive.

“We didn’t think you were going to make it.”

His eyes were wet and bloodshot. He went out the door, sniffling. Two police officers came in, with chatter and beeping coming from their radios. One looked at the floor and the other let out a deep breath.

How to Skin a Human,279,11,"In Medieval times it was called flaying but the practice was going on long before and all around the world. It means to skin people alive.


Firstly, skin isn't the easiest thing to remove without some preparation. It's the body's largest organ and to be able to seperate it neatly, requires the skin to be primed. Pinning the person out in the hot sun until they become badly sunburnt or put into a scalding hot bath works best. If you choose the second way then make sure you remove them before they are boiled alive. The skin is now tender.


Secondly, some believed the best bit to take off first would be the face. Make gentle scores around the neck- don't cut their throat -and pull away. This will hurt a lot as nerves are embedded deep into skin layers. The only thing worse than dying this way is probably severe radiation poisoning like on that show ""Chernobyl.""


To remove all the skin it's best to take off large sections of it. Cut deeply and then rip it off. There's no other way.


There will be tons of blood loss so be prepared for it getting messy. Your skin is kind of what's keeping all the blood in.


Something else to be aware of is infection. With so many wounds and tissue damage it's going to happen. 


One good thing is that when your body experiences really horrible pain it reacts by releasing something called endorphins. It helps a little but nothing like enough to make any difference.


Now, assuming the person has got this far and is still alive they could still die from hypothermia. You see, your skin helps keep you warm too.


After that, parts of your body might go numb due to nerve damage. This is what diabetics often experience. This isn't good as once those nerves are dead that's it.


Then there's shock, unconsciousness, etc. Your skin won't grow back either like it does when you hurt yourself a little.


Worst of all is that you usually take days to die after having your skin removed. For the really lucky ones it might only take hours.


That's it.


""Err.. Thank you, Melissa."" The teacher remarked in shock. ""When I said research something about Medieval history I never meant anything this explicit.""


Melissa blushed. ""I'm sorry, Miss.""


Some of the other pupils looked very pale. A couple were laughing.


Her teacher saw that she had upset Melissa and so she smiled in order to raise her spirits. She was only twelve and a very courteous, intelligent young lady. She understood that some children do go through phases of being fascinated with the macabre.


""Not to worry."" The teacher joked. ""Now, it's very graphic but how do you know any of this would actually happen?""


Melissa pointed to the empty desk in the corner of the classroom. The one that used to be occupied by Matthew Cartwright.

The Vompyzie,8,1,"
""You see there?"" said Hugo the old captain, hanging his lantern over the half-covered dead woman the young man was studying while in the graveyard. ""A vambie. We saw."" 

""I thought it's called vompyzie."" Theo rose to face him. ""Right?""

""Local name, boy. Same stink.""

""So this--"" Theo paused, then continued. ""This beast . . ."" 

""I thought you're an expert on monsters.""

""Just to be sure, Hugo.”

""Why, yea,"" was Hugo's reply. He next ordered the guards to remove her. 

""Wait, Hugo.”

“What now?”

Theo took out a stake and hammer from his satchel.

He staked her heartwise.

After the deed, Theo faced the guards, then the blood trail, then the full moon. It was a quiet night. For now.


&


The two men walked through the graveyard. Theo held his revolver, cautious, alert. Hugo led the way. Over time, the graves they encountered had mortesafes. And it was there they found more blood. They trekked toward the vaults.

“You know, boy?” the old man said, “I thought experts-- “ 

“Hunters?” Theo corrected. 

“Yea. I thought your kind was old tales.”

“We’re still here; we’re called Bestiarian Inquisitors. Tamers, slayers of beasts of our world. But yes, hunters.”

“Heh.”

Minutes passed, and Theo suddenly stopped. His nose wrinkled. The odor. Hugo stopped too. They were finally at their location. 

“Oi, boy,” said Hugo, giving a puzzled look. “Something wrong?”

The young man moved past him by three paces. The iron gate to one vault was left slightly bent and open. A foul odor . . .

“Is it in there?”

The Hunter quickly gestured to the old captain to hide. Hugo put out the lantern and obeyed. Now standing alone, Theo readied his revolver and waited along the vault’s wall outside the entrance. He finally heard it: hiss-grunt-hiss-screech! Without waste, he threw an onion in and hid again, covering his nose. The smell sickening sweet. 

SCREEEECH!! 

Before long, the creature appeared. It flew past him and transformed. The moonlight showed a humanoid with rotten, almost hairless skin. Its mouth and chin dripped in blood. It saw with glowing eyes; it charged like lightning.

Theo aimed, but the vompyzie swiped his gun away. Man and beast wrestled about. Theo fought for his face against the vompyzie's mouth. He heard a hiss-grunt-grunt. Desperate sounds. His arms holding it back tensed. 

The Vompyzie renewed its attempt.

Grunt-hiss-HiSSS!!!

Theo’s heart went pound, pound, pound — like a frantic drum. His strength weakened . . .

THUD! A sound of glass and creaking metal. 

The vompyzie yelped. 

“Oi, boy!” It was Hugo. But before anything, the creature recovered. It mauled the old captain, biting off his flesh. Theo grabbed his gun. A thunder. A headshot. 

The vompyzie fell dead.

“Hugo!” Theo cradled him. It was too late. The old man was gone as well . . . right?

After some reflection, Theo knew what he had to do. He re-cocked his gun and aimed: undead Hugo's a new vompyzie.",1620676223.0
My Sister is Dead,237,31,"  

I don’t care that my sister’s dead. 

Mom’s leaking all over the corpse in the small white coffin. Her tears I mean. It’s like a part of mom will be buried with my sister.

My dad sees I’m not crying, and I hope he thinks it’s cause of shock. But I relax when I see the braindead look in his eyes. He looks deader than my sister who’s sleeping in her forever bed like a happy little devil. 

We leave church and stop at the cemetery. I hope we get ice cream afterwards. We usually get ice cream after church. But first we have to say good riddance to my sis. 

They put her in a hole like a plant, although she won’t be doing any more growing. Some dressed up man is reading from a book, and I’m thinking of ice cream topped with Oreos and sprinkles. “Sprinkles? What are you gay?” I imagine my sister saying. She was always taunting me like that. 

People are dropping dirt on her coffin. It’s my turn. I grin because I imagine dropping colorful sprinkles on her coffin instead of dirt.

At home, mom is crying so much I think she’ll dry up. I imagine her skin deflated on the tile floor. She would make a great rug where I could play with my toys. I’d drive my hot wheels all over her lumps. And when I got tired, I could just lay down right there on my human blanket. 

My dad won’t wake up. No matter how hard I pull his hair. There’s a note beside him, it reads: “I am spiraling in a fantastic misery no one else of this world has ever known.” He won’t wake up, and the bizarre thing is that from the look on his face, you might think he was falling.  

We plant my dad just like my sister. 

My mom is like a flower uprooted, rotting, leaves splintering away from the slightest touch. I feel like I could sneeze and blow her out of existence. 

My wilting mom finally notices me. She shuffles into my room. I tell her I’ve been having dreams with too many people.

She takes a gulp from her wine bottle, then says, “Did you know that…the number of people you see in your dreams, is how many ghosts are in your room.”

She leaves laughing. I try to fall asleep but it’s so cold. Eventually I do.

In my dream, my little dead sister is at the foot of my bed. I can’t move. She’s smiling like she won a game. Then a dozen people shamble into the room, all looking like manikins dragged on a string. Then more walk in. So much that that they must climb on my bed and on me. It’s like shovelfuls of dirt being dumped on my body.

Horrible job,18,1,"Detectives POV: 
It was a humid summers evening as the detective was called in for an investigation, he was nervous about this one because of the house's remains. The inside of the house was completely blackened by ashes, the walls of the kitchen were blown out, but the cabinets still there, however charred as they could be.

Flashback for the reader:
An armed robber broke silently into a house he believed unoccupied at 15:30, careful not to alert the neighbours to what he was doing. There, a woman in the kitchen innocently doing the washing up and cooking, completely void to the robbers presence even when he was within talking range. The man pulls out his supressed glock 17 and aimed for the head, he hit a slight bit below as the woman changed her stance and stood up straight. The 9mm bullet went straight through her neck and into the gas pipe behind her, causing an explosion that could be heard for anyone within a kilometres range.

Back to detective:
He went inside the house, and saw the carcasses of a woman and man, both around 5'8 completely burnt from the explosion. He went upstairs and saw in the landing the blackened skeletons of a seven year old boy holding his two year old sister while trying to protect her from the inferno from below.",1620653419.0
Wire/Cloth,61,12,"""The Harlow Experiment of 1958 was a pioneer study in developmental and cognitive psychology, that examined the intricate relationship between an infant and its mother.

""In the experiment, Harry F. Harlow selected a group of infant rhesus macaques, separated them from their mothers, and reared them in a peculiar setting: he constructed two surrogate mothers - one out of cold, hard metal wire and one out of soft, cushy fabric. The metal wire mother is equipped with a feeding bottle, within is what the baby macaques need to survive. And the comfortable, cuddly cloth mother has nothing at all.""

""He placed the infants within the enclosure, and observed which surrogate mother they would prefer. As soon as the infant was within the enclosure, it ran towards the cloth mother, hugged it tight, and stayed there.""

""Over the next few days or even months, the infant would cling to the cloth mother, only venturing off to feed itself occasionally. It became attached to the structure, recognizing and relying on its specific 'facial' features.""

""Harlow's experiment was a game-changer. It established that there is much more to a mother-infant relationship than milk. That infants prefer physical comfort and sense of safety to nourishment. It generated waves of debate and controversy in its aftermath.""

A ghost in the shower?,15,0,"I just needed to feel safe. 

I had been crying for hours over that dickasaur. My eyes were red rimmed and my chest hurt. I swear to God an actual physical chain was attached to the bloody organ.

I checked to make sure nobody was home and pushed open the bathroom door.

*Good I can mediate without being disturbed* 

I turned on the water for the shower and tested the water. It was ice cold. I sighed and stared at myself in the mirror. *you are fucking mess eh* My reflection remained spitefully silent. 

I stuck my hand in the stream and concluded the water was adequate. I turned off all the lights and put a towel under the door to block out the remainder. Careful I stepped into the shower and then slumped to floor. 

I immediately started sobbing. A constant condition at the time. My self absorbed anguish was disrupted by the vibrations of the plastic tub. 

Disturbed I became dead silent my ears straining to pick up the slightest sound. That's when I heard the very distinct sound of something or someone slumping down next to me. I knew it was impossible. I knew there wasn't couldn't be someone in there with me. I tried to reason with my hammering heart and I didn't so much as breathe.

After what seemed like hours I broke the tense eerie silence. 

*hello??* 

More silence. Frozen in terror I waited a few more minutes then abruptly ran out of the bathroom soaking wet.

Till this day I have no idea who or what was in the bathroom with me. 

Honestly, I really want to know.",1620646640.0
Father's son,4,1,"I held it in my hand. I felt it’s weight, the balance in my hand. The pounding on the door continued, ceaselessly, only broken up by the shouts, screams of my father, his desperate sobs lingering in my ears. There was no way out. I offered up a silent prayer as my shaking hands tightened around my weapon, as I raised it, slowly, mustering up the courage to do what must be done.

“My father was always a distant man. At least to me. What I remember most vividly through my teenage years was that feeling, y’know? That feeling of inadequacy. All I felt was the shadow, that my father cast over me. I never was to feel the sun.“As I grew older, I began to see the futility of it all. The misery he had caused me. He didn’t even own a gun. Behind all his smiles and laughter and “g’day champ, how you doin’s?” all I could feel for him was contempt, hatred. I didn’t even need a real reason, I just felt it.  It was all I thought about, the shadow, the shadow the shadow… ""

“Every moment of my life, night or day was spent, wasted on him. Thinking of how I wasn’t good enough. Of how he had forced me to live like this, a coward, scared and alone. What I wanted to do to him.”

“He thought that he tried. He was belittling me this whole time, I know. He mocked me blatantly. He said that he wanted me to stop pushing him away, he was sorry for what he might have done to me, he only wanted to get closer to me. He begged me for that. Begged me. But I knew.. That man was incapable of love, incapable of caring. He didn’t care for my mum, didn’t protect my mum, couldn’t protect my mum. He didn’t have it in him, didn’t own a gun.

“So that’s why I did it. I could feel it. The time running out, the pathetic, decaying old man dying. I didn’t even plan it you see. It was spontaneous, spur of the moment. When I found that gun in his sock draw, I cried. He had it; he had a gun. Yet I didn’t. Secrets and lies, he had what it takes. He had what I didn’t. Then I knew, knew what I had to do. Knew what must be done. So, I did it. Plain and simple. Night and day. I took the gun. Now it was me, not him who had what it takes.”

“You know I once used to pray, pray, that I’d be more than my father’s son. But I never got there, never will be. Or perhaps now I am. You see actions, thoughts, feelings, words, they disappear, like the mist on a mountain range, dissipating into thin air. But this, this action, these stories. They will live forever.

Might Be A Killer,1414,35,"So... I think my neighbor might be a killer. 

&#x200B;

Look, I get that spying on people is frowned upon, but something weird happened a little while ago, so hear me out for a minute. 

&#x200B;

My home sits atop a hill on a secluded road, the only other house around is a little ways below mine. So naturally when I heard my neighbor’s voice accompanied by another, I was curious. This was a first, in the entire time he’d lived next door he never had company over. 

&#x200B;

I found myself pressed against the glass, craning my neck to get a good view of his driveway. There was a gorgeous woman with him, a good deal younger and dressed to the nines. By the way she talked, by the way she moved, I could tell she was heavily inebriated. 

&#x200B;

Just before he opened the door for her, he turned his head towards my house and looked up at my window. 

&#x200B;

*Oh shit*

&#x200B;

I shrank away, hoping that he hadn’t seen me gawking at them. After a few minutes I peeked back out, watching him pour red wine through his living room window. A malicious smile spread across his face once she put the glass to her lips. 

&#x200B;

*Don't drink that!*

&#x200B;

As if hearing my thoughts, he strode over to the window, glaring up at where I stood. My skin was crawling, I felt trapped inside his cold pupils until he pulled the curtains together, obscuring my view. 

&#x200B;

*Was that a scream?*

&#x200B;

I hardly dare leave my post. I just want to know she's okay. I'll sit here all night if I have to. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hours have gone by. I finally see him opening the curtains, all dressed for work. I can hear him whistling a jaunty tune as he strolls out to his car and pulls away.  

&#x200B;

I haven’t seen the girl again. I do my best to talk myself through it. 

&#x200B;

*There’s no reason to jump to any conclusions here. That’s not strange. Maybe she’s staying for a while. Maybe she’s still sleeping. Maybe... it's none of my business*

&#x200B;

Still, something doesn’t feel right. I need to see her, just to be certain, just to put my mind at ease. I remain glued to my window, eyes fixed on the narrow view into his home. Time ticks away, with each second I grow more anxious.

&#x200B;

*What if she never comes out?* 

&#x200B;

*No, don’t go there*

&#x200B;

*Everything is fine, don’t overreact*

&#x200B;

My breath catches as the woman finally comes back into view, and all of my suspicions are confirmed.  

&#x200B;

There is a look of confusion on her face. Her skin is translucent. She floats above the floor. Red ribbons trail from ghastly wounds like billowing smoke. I am horrified, frozen in place, as she glides over to the window. Our eyes meet, and she places her palms against the glass.

Karibus,14,5,"They say you can get lost in a good book.

&nbsp;

This is (of course) not true.

&nbsp;

Because it’s not just books.

&nbsp;

The Karibus are inside every story ever told.

&nbsp;

Nobody knows where the Karibus came from. They might have been an idea that broke free from some ancient shaman’s mind, a dream that slipped its mooring and scuttled away into the world, hungry and cold. Or they may have come from somewhere outside, slipping through the edges of space like cockroaches spilling through a crack in the wall. Long ago, before Gutenberg and Shikibu, before papyrus and the sagas carved on walrus bones, when the first storytellers had gathered the tribe and told their tales beneath the candles of the stars, the Karibus were there. They waited in the gaps between the words, like a tiger that pads and prowls in the long dark shadows past the safety of the flickering firelight.

&nbsp;

They can never be seen, because they can be anything. Anything ever described in a story, whether in words or song or charcoal and ochre on the wall of a cave, can be hollowed out and made into a shape for the Karibus to wear for hunting. They hide behind words, spinning their webs beneath a foreshadow, or laying their eggs in the twist of an ending, or lurking behind the last full stop on the last page of the last book you read in the house that you grew up in.

&nbsp;

They bide their time, waiting until you’re tired and unable to fight back. Then, when a half-remembered fragment of story bubbles up in your mind, the Karibus will reach out for you with their talons or their tendrils or their snatching, catching fingers. Once they have you, they will drink you and drain you until the remains of your life are nothing more than a rattling clutch of letters on the page of a book; a background character mentioned briefly and then forgotten by the end of the chapter.

&nbsp;

So if you’re ever reading a book, late at night and warmly wrapped up in your bed, be careful that you don’t take a wrong turn of phrase somewhere. You might end up lost, while all the while there’s the sound of scratching at the back of your mind; the Karibus are clawing their way in, and they are hungry.

The Karibus are inside every story ever told.

How am I going to explain this to my landlord,36,7,"
I love to see how deep water wells go and I don't know why I find it so much fun. It's a fun hobby of mine really and I just enjoy knowing how deep wells go. I travel all over the world and whenever I see a well I get so excited because I just have to know how deep it is. A couple of months ago I found a well and I then excitedly snatched a kid from a wandering mother and I threw the kid down the well. By the scream I was able to calculate how deep the well went. The scream got silent and I knew exactly how deep the well was. I then decided to throw the screaming mother down the well just to make sure.

Then a couple of weeks later I found another well and I couldn't believe how lucky I was. I love finding lonely wells in the middle of no where. I snatched another person and dragged him to the well and threw him down the well. The well wasn't so deep as I could hear him asking someone for help and to be honest I only like deep wells. Deep wells have a certain character to them and in my opinion the deeper the well is then the more higher they are in the hierarchy of wells. Shallow wells are at the bottom of the hierarchy.

Then a couple of days ago I think I found the deepest well in the world and I don't know how I knew but the aura and energy this well gave off was immense. It's was like the king of the wells and it was definitely majestic by how deep it was. I definitely had to throw someone down this particular well and I grabbed another man and threw him down the well. When I saw him falling it felt like he had stopped mid air but then he carried on falling. Sometimes I would be able to hear his screams and then all of a sudden there was nothing but silence, and then a couple of minutes later his screams would be hearable again.

Also sometimes I could see him falling and then he would disappear to only reappear again minutes later. This well was really hard to calculate. A couple of days later I go home to my flat at the top floor of the building and the guy that I threw down the deepest well, had crashed through my flat ceiling.

Chameleon Family,19,0,"Ricky, our pet chameleon, was the best of pals. We loved the way he'd gobble up all the crickets with that far-reaching tongue, his eyes rolling around in that cheeky fashion, the stealthy movements. He sure enjoyed putting on a performance; mighty good at it too, he was.

My younger brother, who was the only other person living with me, was given the luxury of decorating Ricky's little home. Fill it with nature and colour, I told him. Oh boy, did we spoil the bastard! But you couldn't go light on something that was such a treasure.

Honestly, sadly, my brother's interest in Ricky began to crack like a quivering stilt. We have visions of what our friends, our family, and even our pets should be like. If they don't fulfil our ideologies then either we get on with our lives or we get upset. Well, my brother simply began to disregard our poor young lizard.

One time when he thought I'd left the house to go to work, I tricked him and stood by the staircase listening. He went into Ricky's room.

""Ugly piece of shit. What are you looking at? Gah, I've grown sick of you...""

Don't call him that, I whispered to myself.

What I heard next made me squeeze the bannister, the temptation to intervene.

*Wait*...*Wait*...

""Ha-ha...Look at that!""

My brother was taunting Ricky by drumming his fingers against the enclosure; I saw him through the wooden panels at the top of the staircase.

You ought to stop that, I whispered to myself.

Well, it's needless to say that my brother didn't stop.

So, Ricky. What do you say we have some fun?

Just you and I.

My Mummy Always Protects Me,238,10,"My Daddy hates me.

I think I know this because he hits me a lot. I don’t know why he hates me. Maybe it is when I cry, with my mouth turned all upside-down, and my cheeks all swallowed up and with hot tears down my cheeks. He hates it when I cry. Then he will hit me again and again.

He hits me even more when I am not crying, sometimes. He hits me when he smells bad, when he drinks a lot. He likes to drink this fizzy pee-coloured drink. Then his cheeks will go all red and he hits me.

But I also have a mummy.

Mummy always protects me. Daddy hits Mummy too. Until blood rolls out of her nose and her skin goes all purple. But I always hear my Mummy say don’t hurt Ian; leave him alone. And when Daddy hurts me, Mummy is always there with a Band-aid and some medicine. Then she will give me my teddy and I will go to sleep.

But one night my mummy dies.

Daddy is beating her again, over and over, until one night she drops on the floor. All this blood is swirling around her in a big puddle and her hair is dyed red. I hear Daddy shouting at her, calling her mean things. I kneel down and look at my mummy. She isn’t breathing.

I call the ambulance. The nice man in the uniform checks her and says she is dead. Just like that. Dead. We have to wear black and go to something called a funeral where people are sad that my mummy is dead. I get to give her flowers.

After the funeral, Daddy yells at me again. He smells really bad this time. He says it is my fault my mummy dies. He raises the bottle to hit me.

Then I hear something outside.

Somebody is coming. She is crawling towards us. Her hands are skinny like bone. Her hair is wild in the wind. Her clothes are tattered to shreds. She smells of soil and earth. Her face is so, so pale, and she looks very, very angry.

I watch happily as my mummy comes to protect me, one last time.

As for my daddy, I don’t know what happened to him. When he sees what is going on outside, his face is as pale as the moon. He mutters something I don’t understand--then he drops to the floor.

Filth,45,2,"“Even from filth, beautiful things grow.”

Mum said that all the time when I was growing up. She was an avid gardener, had to be to grow enough food. Dad didn’t work, and his benefit went on cheap beer and slot machines.

I thought I got what she meant; just like a pretty flower needs dirt and stinking fertiliser to grow, hard times were part of growing up into a woman. And the times certainly were tough.

Dad would be gone from dawn till dusk, drinking and complaining about mum to his friends. He’d get in, reeking of piss and stale smoke, and ask “What’s for dinner”, and then he’d grunt no matter what she said.

Sometimes, he’d complain that there was no meat, and mum would say nothing. She’d say nothing so loud my ears nearly rung.

On the bad nights that’d be enough to send him into a fit about how we spent all day judging him behind his back. He was right, of course, but if either one of us said anything he’d backhand us.

Even the best nights weren’t good. There would always be something to scream about, some reason to punch walls and stomp. A reason to drag mum by her hair to their room.

One day, I woke up to her repeating “Even from filth, beautiful things grow” in a sing song. She told me it was their anniversary, and she was making a special dinner. She’d used some squirrelled away money to buy steak for dinner, and was making the most beautiful, home-grown salad on the side.

“It’s going to be a special night, dear, so take this money and go see a film, okay?”

I wasn’t old enough to know exactly what kind of ‘special’ she was implying, but old enough to get the idea. So I took that money, put on my threadbare trainers, and went out to go see Batman Returns.

I got back well past dark. The living room and kitchen were both empty, and no sounds could be heard. Whatever ‘special’ things were afoot, I figured, were over. That night I slept the happiest sleep I think I ever had.

Mum wasn’t home when I woke up. Neither was dad, but that wasn’t so weird. It was summer holidays, so I just shrugged, made a sandwich, and watched cartoons.

When mum wasn’t around by nightfall I got a little concerned. I had no clue where she could be, until I saw the lights were on in her little garden shed.

I felt silly for not having checked there all day, and wondered what she could be doing all day. I made my way outside, and heard her singing, almost manic.

“Even from filth, beautiful things grow.”

Something about it set me on edge. I opened the door trepidatiously and found my parents. Dad was on his back, his torso torn open to make room for foil and fertiliser.

Mealtime,8,6,"He was in agony. I didn’t care though. The ripping of his skin filled the silent room as I peeled it of his body. Inhaling the sweet scent of his flesh I smile. Briefly, I wonder what it would feel like to have this happen to myself. The thought leaves as I refocus on my prize, I’m too hungry to deliberate the role reversal of predator and prey. I separate his body into sections, each piece delectably juicy and tantalizing. Finished chewing, I look at the name tag stuck to a piece of removed skin. Thomas H. Thank you Thomas.

The Device,23,4,"We obviously had no idea what it was at first. It looked like a transparent rectangle of light and energy, yet we could touch and interact with it. The device reacted as soon as I grabbed it, which, in hindsight, might’ve caused the end of Earth. 


I have nothing to show for the life that I’ve lived, so I figured this could be my claim to fame. ‘Man discovers a strange alien artifact, gets millions of dollars and scores of women.’ 


I don’t know it could’ve happened. Don’t judge. 


I got out before the changes started. I was at work, and returned to my house to find the scenery completely different, my house surrounded by swarms of hazmat suits and government agents. They confiscated the device and interrogated me, eventually allowing me to work with them to help figure out what this thing does.


No matter where they stored it, the containment chamber changed. Strange crystals would grow from the ground and ceiling, sprouting dry, hard fruit. Human skin cells would turn brittle and rough, and were observed to have been altered chemically. All carbon atoms within the cells had been changed to silicon atoms. While silicon was similar to carbon, it did not function the exact same way, and the process was always fatal to any tissue that was converted.     


From this the doctors formed a theory. This device, whatever it was, is meant to terraform an environment. Humans had a similar idea for colonizing other planets, but it appears we weren’t the first to start developing technology to do it. This device was probably meant to hit an empty planet, turning it into a stable environment for whatever lifeforms had created it. Instead, it hit our planet, and it had no idea how to comprehend carbon based life forms. 


Unfortunately, the device can’t be shut off, and it only seems to be getting stronger. We’ve had to move sites multiple times, as they keep getting engulfed in crystalline structures, killing off any and all life in the area, leaving behind rock and crystal corpses.  


It’s only a matter of time before the spread is uncontainable. Days, weeks, hopefully months, but inevitably, the terraformation will be complete, and Earth will no longer be able to sustain carbon based life, instead existing for silicon based life forms. 


An unknown object has been sighted heading to our planet a few days ago. I can’t say for sure, but I believe it's the aliens. I wonder if they meant to terraform an empty planet, or if they just didn’t know or care that we were here first. For all we know, they might not even perceive us as being alive, the same way the crystal structures it created were seen as dead to us.  


I doubt we’d be able to communicate, their technology doesn’t even perceive life on Earth as life at all. I wonder if I’ll be changed before they get here, or if I'll get to meet extraterrestrial [life.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ninjagall15/comments/mk9dfu/insomniac_bite_sized_scary_stories_now_available/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",1620612413.0
They were here,5,0,"I was just 8 at the time, but my memories from that time was very vivid. It was a hot summer afternoon, I was just on my way home from my friend's house. We played all day and my parents don't worry about me that much, since everyone in the neighborhood knows me and is their friends too.

 'hide when you hear them'

Then, one of them pulled out a knife, and that's when I started running for my life. There are a few houses around so I screamed. I screamed until I got back home. I've never told anyone about it, Because they'll just say that I'm going cray-cray.

Squashing Spiders,14,1,"I fucking hate spiders. There’s a hole in my apartment wall where they all swarm out of. I have to stand there with a shoe and do battle with the horde. After a while, the motions become rhythmic. See a spider, squash it, leave the imprint on my wall. See a bigger spider, squash it, leave the imprint on my wall. Rinse and repeat. There’s always another spider. I have no idea where they all come from. It seems spiders of every type cluster in that wall. Common house spiders, black widows, even tarantulas. I have no idea how those things fit in there. 

If you stand there squashing for long enough eventually the spiders with human faces come out. They don’t really do much, just stare out at you with their tiny faces and massive grins. They all have massive grins on their tiny faces. Don’t ask me why, I don’t know. They must think something’s funny. I inevitably squash them and leave the faces on my wall, like tiny stickers. There must be a thousand faces on my wall. All of them grinning at me.

One day a spider with my face emerged from the wall. It had the same massive grin as all the others, one so wide I couldn’t replicate it if I cut my cheeks open. I squashed him just like all the others. His grin turned into a frown as his face was squished into my wall, like a tiny portrait of my own flat face. I immediately regretted it. That was a stupid decision. Why did I have to squash that spider? It only hastened its end. After all, it’s only a matter of time till I get squashed instead. ",1620608393.0

AITA for confronting my father sbout his snoring as it keeps waking me up,1191,35,"I know this is a trivial matter and other people are facing worse situations, but honestly I am at my wits end. 

My father had to move into my spare room a couple of weeks ago after he got kicked out of his house for not paying the mortgage. He was always bad with money as he loved to gamble on the horses.

My house is a two storey with a small basement. It was originally a three bedroom but I converted one of the bedrooms into a man cave with a gaming PC and giant television. 

The spare bedroom that he sleeps in is right beside my room. The first time I was awoken I actually thought it was an earthquake as it was that loud. The walls were literally shaking. 

Since he has moved in I have probably got an average of five hours sleep a night which is affecting my work. One of the nights after being awoken I heard the screams of one of my victims in the basement. I had forgotten to remove her tongue in my sleep deprived state.

A Thought,10,3,"John wanted to talk about Jim and him, and so he tried to part Jim's hair with his gentle fingertips.

Choking with John's hands on his throat, Jim knew this fact: *When John hits me, I know that he loves me, because he finally sees me.*

The cat, which wasn't part of this conversation, could only look on in alarm. The poor thing sniffed at the thought that was lying sprawled in shock and agony.

The thought was a whisper: *One has to finish the other one off. I rather it be me, my love.*

Moon-Lit Dip,58,11,"She swam in a moon-lit pool.  Glints twinkled as ripples rose to touch the beam and their flashes seemed like nature’s silent paparazzi.  Misty fingers curled up into the night and obscured her naked form only a little.  She was a drop of cream floating on the black coffee surface of the pond.

I sat on a grassy rise and caressed the soft earth, winding blades of grass and imagining what it must be like to do the same with her hair.   Pulling up a few, I distracted myself and played with them.  They were too small to make a whistle with as I had as a child, but I spread one between my thumbs nonetheless.

I was as blue as the thickets and patches of lawn around me.  I was waiting.  It wasn’t long before I heard a twig snap in the forest behind me.  I got up, stretched and looked at a bobbing flashlight make its way through the woods.  As it got to the edge, I was there to meet him.

Robbie hadn’t believed my lie about where I go on certain nights.  We work together and he noticed that at certain times of the month I was always tired.  At first, I didn’t want to explain it to him, but he pressed one day at lunch.

“C’mon, man.  Give,” he said before taking a bite of his turkey club.  I looked at him for a moment.

“I don’t really wanna say,” I said.  “It’s embarrassing.”

“Dude.  We’re friends.  No judgments.  You can tell me.”

I sighed and said, “I found a girl.”

“Hell yeah, man!” he replied clapping me on the shoulder.  He was a pretty big guy and it jostled me a bit.

“No, you don’t understand.  She doesn’t know I’m there.  I just… I just kinda watch her.”  I told him the story of how I’d discovered her in this pool on certain nights and since then, I’d been… just watching what she does.

“You little creep!” he laughed, smiling proudly.  “You gotta show me.”

And that’s why he was here now in this glade.  He seemed all giddy as we quietly approached my perch.  I watched his face intently.  He started snickering when he saw her.  His eyes were moving all around taking in the scene.  Then, suddenly, they pinned and I knew that she’d made contact with him.  His jaw went slack and his shoulders dropped.  He mouthed the words, *Help Me* as he began walking haltingly toward the pool.  His first few steps into the liquid sizzled and he began screaming.  Still he moved towards her.  I watched him suddenly drop to waist level and knew the acid had devoured his legs.  I imagined his next few steps were on stumps before melting fully into the pond.

Walking from the scene, I wondered when it would be my turn.",1620550172.0
I went out to hunt.,14,0,"I live alone in a cabin away from people, deep within the woods. I always felt at ease among the animals rather than people, so much so, I prefer to see people as their inner animal. It had been a while since I went for a hunt. The meat in the storage was running out.

I put on my hunting clothes and went for a hunt with my hunting gear. I parked across the town's walmart and started looking for game. I see lot of wolves, hyenas, some bison and alpacas. Nothing was picking my interest, until I saw him, A Sheep, with his little lambs. I knew what I wanted for dinner.

I carefully followed him to his nest, a perfect spot to snatch, no other animals around to cause a scene. On my way home too. I parked far and crawled in to the bushes across the nest. I could see directly inside the sheep's nest. Mommy sheep and Daddy sheep are putting 3 little lambs to sleep. I keep watching.

The sheep are talking, mommy sheep said something and now daddy sheep is shaking. It's skin is loosening up. This is new for me. As mommy sheep keeps talking, daddy sheep is shedding its skin. This is amusing, I'm seeing a full blown wolf. It starts bearing it's fangs, and in one fell swoop it slams the sheep in to the wall. Red glitter is sprayed all over the wall creating a beautiful portrait of me.

The wolf starts circling the trembling sheep, it drags it across the cave and takes it to a wood chipper. Velvet across the garage. It's eyes are glowing, just like mine. I slowly crawl back to my truck, the hunt is ruined. But I accidentally hit a deer on my way back home.

Instead of lamb, I had to settle for venison.",1620580041.0
Your Favorite Nightmare,38,8,"
 
He threaded the needle slowly. Stitching the head to the neck like surgery.
 
The monster was some blueish dinosaur creature with a dandelion texture. Sporting white ivory teeth, bony fingers, and a round bulbous tail with a spike. A behemoth from the netherworld—some ungodly and unforsaken evil molded from the imagination of a madman.
 
Gregory put the sowing needle down and picked up the cigarette roller. Thumbing his hash into a perfect smokable cylinder.
 
His eyelids were tiptoeing over dark shadowy splotches. Exhausted from hours of sketching, gathering materials, and needling.
 
When he lit the joint, Gregory bounced back to life. Grabbing his phone and thumbing through the client list...
 
“Hey, it’s Gregory. Your monsters done.”
 
He exhaled. Lifting his boots onto the table top near the computer. Confident. A soft smile on his face now...
 
*+*+*+
 
John Stevens wasn’t your typical 9-5er. Forty-two, blue-collar, and cocaine thin—the factory worker looked more torture victim than husband and father of three.
 
When Gregory whipped his van, a humble black four by 4 with tinted windows and fat rubber tires for off-roading, into the neighborhood—Stevens gulped once and trotted on outside. Hands in pockets, head tilted down low, wearing a mask of shame over his face to hide the fear.
 
“Mr. Stevens.” Gregory belched, rolling his driver's side window down halfway.
 
“Yea, that’s me. Do you have the...thing with you?”
 
( Gregory flipped the ignition switch off, allowing the van to settle back into a deep sleep. Some permanent midnight.)
 
“I do. It’s in the back. You’re lucky I finished the thing just this afternoon. Dinosaurs aren’t the easiest, you know...”
 
“Well, blame my youngest. The things terrify him to death.” Stevens hummed. His eyes scanning the block up and down suspiciously.
 
“I added a tail with a spike. I thought you could leave it hanging out from under his bed or something.” Gregory replied.
 
“Christ...I mean, yea...that’s a good idea.” Stevens gulped. Every fiber of his being wanting to be anywhere but here...But what choice did he have any more?
 
“Mr. Stevens. There’s no need to be nervous; I create nightmares for a living. And parenting is tricky, but for the most part, I understand why. Your kid? He’s...”
 
“Loud—and gets in trouble at school. My wife and I are worried about him. He’s only seven but should be punished correctly.” Stevens retorted. Cutting Gregory off...
 
*+*+*+
 
As Gregory unloaded the costume, he grinned. Knowing Stevens would adore it. He’d needled it according to the mans’ measurements. It would fit him perfectly...
 
In his life, Gregory relied on three principles.
 
Number one: that every parent preferred scaring their kids themselves. Nobody had EVER used another stranger.
 
Two: that children were afraid of virtually everything—bats, snakes, giant birds, ...faceless demons from other dimensions.
 
And three: after Gregory got his money—
 
 
The same sick thought bowling pinned around his brain every time...

Azrael - Angel of Death,8,0," A lone young woman walked in the freezing streets of suburban New York, her body highlighted by the dim street lights and the scarce streak of moonlight shining on her, like a spotlight. She was oblivious as to what was going to occur.

The road was crowded with traffic during the day but was diminished to only a few vehicles at night. If she had screamed, had struggled, or had fought - nobody would notice. Nobody could. She should have known better than to walk alone.

The blaring of car horns, directed at those who jaywalked on the wide road, surrounded her, but that did not camouflage the sounds of the footsteps behind her. A man walked past and onto the road. Having seen him pass successfully and having not seen any cars passing for a moment herself, she stepped onto the cold road with her boots.

A truck turned a corner. She was in the truck’s blind spot.

As the vehicle struck her, she was hurled back, and her bones broke the instant her body touched the ground. The man walked past her and continued to walk. She tried to call for help, but her jaw wouldn’t move.

The truck slowly turned away and continued driving, as if nothing happened, and she lay there helpless, bleeding, and in agonising pain. Her figure motionless, and a dark-red puddle formed around her, she groaned as she drew her last breath, and her blurry vision catching a final glance of steam emitting from her mouth. 

The man then turned back, removing the headphones he had on, and took off the thick jacket he was wearing. 

He looked at the woman’s lifeless body with a face of horror and then began to smile.

“Another soul.” He whispered to himself.

“Bring her to me,” a voice commanded from the heavens, “Azrael.”",1620573039.0

Of the Ghost Poj Ntxoog (Pa Song),9,0,"If you think Casper’s cute, here’s a certain ghost I’d like to mention. 

Ready?

The Hmong not only fear the tiger, but also its minion, Poj Ntxoog. I tell you it’s a scary ghost that  traditionally lives in the jungles and beneath dens and boulders and even near farms. Like the tiger, Poj Ntxoog is a shapeshifter.

A shapeshifter, from a little girl, or, as some say, a beautiful woman, or even a tiger. But let me mention that description can vary. 

 Imagine you’re walking in the jungle and trip over a rock. You might see her: long, ungroomed black hair, gray-dead skin, wearing a pleated skirt, walking with backward feet, watching you with pure black eyes, even rotated eyes --  approaching you with interest . . .

“He-he-he,” she might laugh. “He-he-he . . . ”

 Oh yeah, she can turn invisible anytime she wants . . . 

She sometimes accompanies the tiger . . .

Like the tiger, she steals people’s souls, making them sick or die. It’s the job of the Hmong shaman to retrieve those souls and seal her away. 

And like all ghosts, she loves to play games and make trouble. Remember she can take the form of a little girl?

Anyway, it went right at me like a bat out of hell or something, moaning and breathing its rot-breath in my face.”

“Well, you seem to be okay to me. It’s not like you don’t have protection…”

“Yeah, I got it right in the skull with that piece Mario gave me. Whatever was left of its brains went flying everywhere. But, Sal, I’m telling you: I don’t get paid enough for this kind of shit; especially after what happened with Marcus, last week. There wasn’t much left of him to look at, after it was done…”

“Yeah, yeah. I feel real bad for his family, but it’s a hazard of the job. The new normal.”

“Hazard of the job! The new normal! I could be sitting home, quarantining like everyone else and collecting more money off unemployment right now than what I’m doing.”

“Listen, Tony. You know how things are right now. We’re busier than we’ve ever been, ever since Dominic came back from Sicily with those new spices. They’re going crazy for this new Sicilian crust we’ve got.”

I don't know what the fuck is happening but I am beyond perplexed and freaked out of this occurance.

It started this gloomy morning when received a note slipped under my front door titled ""The Pale Armadillo"". As soon as I read the first sentence of the note which was ""Fight fire with fire and you will demise into the most
excruciating death for all eternity.."", I felt a sharp pain in the left side of my chest. 

Being only 34 years of age, I didn't want to believe it was a heart attack because I've never experienced such a thing. The pain slowly and steadily started to increase. 

Then the entire surrounding went quiet. I felt as if I went deaf. I stumbled over to my bed and grabbed my cell phone to call 911 for help but my vision went dark 
as if I had gone blind.

I reached around and felt my bedside table, opened the drawer, reached in a found my notebook and pen. I started writing in case someone finds me if I'm unconscienece.

Taken By Birds,8,3,"I was sitting in my tenth-storey apartment, working on a symphony, when the hawk burst in—

Through the window—

*glass exploding*, and the bird cutting itself so that it sprayed blood, like a boxer walloped in the jaw, every time it ruffled its feathers.

To say I stood up would be an understatement.

I *leapt!*

The bleeding bird approached, and I approached, and at some point it started getting dark, and when I looked outside I saw hundreds of birds at the window, blocking the sunlight, some of them coming into the apartment, others hideously squawking. They made so much wind with their flapping, my papers began flying around.

I tried to shoo them out, but they attacked me: their claws—their beaks—

I backed away—

Tripping on a chair, flipping over, trying to crawl toward the door…

That's when they acted.

Landing on me, pecking at my clothes, ripping—tearing away material, until they exposed my whole back.

Then they dug their talons into me: pain like getting caught on a hundred fishing lines: hooks penetrating skin, anchored in flesh...

Flapping furiously, they lifted me off the floor—

And we flew out the window!

I thought I was going to die, that they were going to drop me there and then, and I prayed and screamed and imagined what I looked like from the street.

But they didn't drop me.

Up we flew, higher and higher majestically above the city, betwixt skyscrapers and below planes, over parks, through clouds, and all the while some sat on me and pecked me—not my clothing, *my flesh!*—pulling strips of me away, raw bleeding strips, most of which went down their gullets but some of which escaped their ravenous intentions and fell…

to the city below…

—and I *felt it all*: I was the body flying and the chunks digesting and the bits going *splat* on asphalt and umbrellas.

I hurt and I rotted.

I saw the city and I was eaten up by stray cats.

I rolled into sewer grates.

I survived.

Until there was less and less of flying me, almost just a skeleton, picked clean; until—

I wasn't flying at all.

Time passed; consciousnesses dwindled; and I was but one small chunk of meat drying out on someone's windowsill.

The window opened.

I slid in, down the wall onto the kitchen counter. I recognized a plate of raw meat and hid among them.

I was fried.

Sizzling on the frying pan in pain.

I was placed upon a plate by a woman and slid toward a man, who licked his lips, lifted knife and fork and sliced and ate me.

How horribly be chewed!

In his mouth, I went round, then down his throat, washed down with cabernet.

I thought I was ended.

But as his juices digested me, I realized I was entering his blood, in which his body pumped me to his brain and—

""What are you doing?"" the woman asked.

I was created by my dead girlfriend,11,0,"I feel the cold around me as I get out of my tube, I am out for the first time and it feels strange, my rubber skin stuck with the residue of slime makes my feet slip as my steps increase further to the control module.

As my body dries from the given time, I wait for Clair to arrive. I’ve been waiting to see her for a while, well... I *have* seen her. But it was while I was being reborn. Seeing her face echoing from the bend of the glass made it easier for me to stay in the tube. However, when she wasn’t there I was just stuck in my own thoughts, but that is besides the point now.

While waiting for her, my eyes wander and eventually pause on the light bleeding under the wooden door. It looks so strange, the door, I haven’t seen much yet, only Clair. I walk to the door and graze my fingers upon it, the feeling makes me jump back, so many bumps and grooves I have never felt anything like that before, or well anything... before.

I turn back to sit down, but then the light from under the door grows the silhouette of a human, then stretches and contorts as the door creeks open.

I spin around to the expectation of a familiar face, to see Clair. But my smile quickly fades as I see the mangled mess of a scrapped together body of blood and gun wounds.

The Ten Story Offer,634,43,"I looked up from my book when I heard the bell jangle.  

I own a lovely, little, rare book store in an old skyscraper.  Every morning, I have the pleasure of walking in and smelling old paper.  It’s quite a wonderful smell, really.  Now, watching Mrs. Jenkins clip-clop over, I steeled myself against the cloud of syrupy perfume that was about to condense about me.  She always rained on my parade, but I smiled warmly as she approached. 

I knew she was going to ask about her order and it infuriated me just a little.  I had told her that obtaining the original notes to Shel Silverstein’s *Boy Named Sue*, which had been made famous by Johnny Cash, might be impossible.  They might not even exist.  I’ve made numerous inquiries to both Silverstein’s and Cash’s attorneys, but have yet to hear anything.  I’ve also enlisted a few private dealers and a private eye to help.  So far, nothing. 

“Good morning Mrs. Jenkins.”  I actually choked a little when I said her name.  My mouth was now a French boutique.  I sipped a little water. 

“Good morning yourself,” she snapped.  “I want to hear something.  I’ve paid your initial fee, which I find ridiculous, mind you.  What is happening with my investment?” 

I drew an unwanted breath.  “Yes.  Of course you do.  I would like to remind you…” 

“Remind me of what?  Do you think I have dementia… or a learning disorder?  Do you think I need you for my memories?  I take garlic and gingko-biloba for such things.  I don’t want a reminder.  I want progress!”  She stared at me expectantly.  

Luckily, my years in customer service allowed me to push how I felt aside to try to help.  This is, after all, what customer service is all about:  trying to help someone. 

“I have many people working on this and as soon as I hear anything, I’ll contact you immediately,” I promised and meant it too.

“No.  You’ll call all of your people right this instant.  I’ll not pay for you sit around with your thumb up your ass.” 

I knew there was no information because I hadn’t been contacted yet, but I thought, *Okay. If this assuages her, I’ll sit here and make the calls.*  

And I did. 

She watched incredulous as one after the other I either got no reply or no one had heard anything. 

“SCAM ARTIST!” she screamed. “FRAUD!” 

Putting up my hands out in a calming way, I said, “I understand your frustrations.  These things take time.  I do have, however, ten very suspenseful stories in the backroom.  They are very rare and few people have ever seen them.  Perhaps you’ll take a look.  I’ll give them to you freely as an apology, if you’d like.”

“Take me to them immediately,” she demanded. 

I led her into the back room, turned quickly and pushed her into the open elevator shaft just to the right of the door.  

The ten stories sounded very suspenseful, indeed.",1620463486.0
The Graveyard Shift at Carter's Convenience,55,5,"Hugh had his nose buried in a sociology textbook when he heard the bell above the door to Carter’s Convenience let out a dainty *ding*. He stole a quick glance at the digital clock next to the cash register. The acid-green letters told him it was 2:22 AM, which could only mean one thing.

“Good evening, Mr. Jenkins,” Hugh said, turning back to his reading.

“Evening, Hubert,” came the raspy reply.

*Right on schedule,* Hugh thought with a nod.

The towering form of Mr. Jenkins was clad in his usual attire for his weekly nighttime visits to Carter’s Convenience: a dark overcoat that stank of graveyard dirt, black gloves over spindly fingers, gray trilby atop his balding head, rounded glasses with jet-black lenses perched on a smashed pug nose. He smiled as he tipped his hat at Hugh, mouth full of jagged teeth the color of rotten lemons.

“Studying hard or hardly studying?” Jenkins asked with his grinding-gravel voice.

Hugh rolled his eyes with a smile. “Yeah, finals are just two weeks away which means it’s cram season. And sociology has never been my strong suit.”

“Well I’m sure a bright young man like yourself will have no trouble passing with flying colors.”

“Well that’s very kind of you.” Hugh set his book down and fished a keyring out from a drawer under the counter, standing from his stool. “Just the usual this week?”

Jenkins nodded. “If you’d be so kind.”

The pair walked to the back of the store past the shelves lined with foodstuffs and other basic sundries, fluorescent lights humming overhead. At the back of the store Hugh unlocked the door to the refrigerated section and stepped inside, Jenkins following behind. From there Hugh inserted a key into another lock tucked away between the milk and alcohol, part of the back wall sliding away as the tumblers clicked.

“Here’s what we’ve got,” Hugh said, shivering slightly.

Jenkins pursed his lips as he surveyed his options. The jars on the shelves of the hidden alcove contained a wide assortment of hands, feet and other body parts. A man’s head floated in a large jar of amber liquid, eyes staring at nothing.

“Not much of a selection this week,” Jenkins noted with a frown. “I guess I’ll take-”

He was cut off by the sound of a door slamming. Hugh and Jenkins turned; through the foggy glass of the refrigerator doors they saw a masked man run behind the counter, and start to smash at the cash register with a handgun.

“Oh. Well that’s convenient,” Jenkins said. He smiled at Hugh. “I know greeting the customers is your thing, but…”

“Yeah go ahead,” Hugh laughed. “Just don’t take too long, please? Freezing my balls off in here.”

“Can do!”

With blinding speed he rushed into the store.

The robber hardly got out a word of warning before Jenkins was upon him.

In the freezer, Hugh sighed.

The Consumer,17,1,"There he was. No more than fifty feet away. Alone and vulnerable.

I grabbed him from behind and forced him to the floor. I gripped his hair, yanked his head back and stuffed the many pieces of paper down his throat.

He gagged, spat them out onto the pavement and started screaming, but not for long.

The plastic bag was retrieved from my pocket and I pulled it over his pathetic face. He fought for some time. Muffled words. For the best. 

Two weeks ago this man had entered the shop I work in. He'd approached my cash register and asked me questions. I gave him the answers but he insisted I was wrong.

He told me that I was about as useful as a broomstick, and less knowledgeable than one. Even my coworkers said he was unreasonable to me. What a fucking cretin, they said.

For fourteen strenuous days I collected all his receipts from our online journal. I laughed at his purchases. He was a regular, so there were many sheets to print off.

These pieces of paper are what I rammed down his throat on this fateful night. There was something gratifying about seeing them all ruined and worthless on the ground.

And what about the bag? Oh, well, I'm glad you ask. It's the strongest one we have in our shop, sir. Most useful, never breaks. So, there's a bit of knowledge for you.",1620523559.0
Thank you meditation teacher,8,0,"
I just want to thank my meditation teacher for teaching me yoga and especially meditation. I use to be a non-believer of meditation but now I am a practitioner of meditation. I cannot believe the benefits of meditation and it has changed my life forever. The calmness that it brings me is unbelievable and no matter what the situation or how serious something is, meditation helps me manage the fear and worry. You see fear will always be an element in our lives and instead of trying to throw it away, we should learn to manage it accordingly.  

 

You see when my father got beat up by some gang left right and centre, he bruised up to the core. He wandered home all crying and begging for help but my mother just laughed at him calling him a pathetic man. The gang that beat up my father belonged to my mothers secret boyfriend, when my father got himself on the sofa my mother mocked my father and told him what she has been doing with her boyfriend. This hurt my father and when my mothers boyfriend came into the house and shot my father so that my mother can be with him forever, I was in a state of meditation and I felt calm under such duress.  

 

Then a couple of weeks later when my mother started crying for my father and regretting what she had done, helping her boyfriend kill my father, she started arguing with her boyfriend. She got sick of her boyfriend quickly, as she just couldn’t take enough of the boyfriends weird ways of constantly having blood on his clothes and constantly drinking out in pubs with people he had killed. My father who was now dead was part of that social group that hangs around with my mothers boyfriend. Through out this ordeal meditation helped me stay calm and sane and helped me manage my emotions. Thank you for this my mediation teacher.  

 

Then when my mother got killed by her boyfriend and he dropped her into some pond, I was all alone but I meditated and kept control. Both my parents who are dead now hang around with my mothers ex-boyfriend in pubs and clubs. They still have some kind of an eye on me and my grandparents aren’t so bad. If meditation wasn’t around my anger would have made me do something incredibly stupid and most likely I would have ended up dead and part of the social group that hangs around with my mother ex-boyfriend.  

 

Thank you for this my meditation teacher but you yourself should have  listened to your own advice on being calm and collected, maybe then you wouldn’t have acted to stupidly and angrily when you tried to kill my mothers ex-boyfriend when he killed your boyfriend. Most importantly you wouldn’t have ended up dead and part of the dead gang that hangs around with my mothers ex boyfriend. So please stop asking me for help.",1620533751.0
What's cooking?,789,46,"Two chefs were standing on my front porch clutching brown paper bags filled with vegetables. Strange.

I pulled the door open. “Yes? Can I help you?”

“There’s no time to waste,” said the dark-haired one on the right. “We’ve gotta get cooking.” He forced his way past me.

I whirled around. “Hey, what do you—”

Behind my back, the tall bearded one stepped inside and closed the door using his foot.

I spun back. “Who are—”

“There’s no time,” he interrupted, readjusting to get a better grip of his bags. From the kitchen, I heard drawers open and close.

“Now wait just a second, who the hell are you people?” I asked, forcefully.

The bearded chef marched past me, checking his watch. “Oh man, we’ve *really* gotta get cooking!”

“Cooking?” I asked. “Cooking what?”

In the kitchen, the dark-haired chef was slicing onions on the counter.

I chuckled. Clearly, it was a case of mistaken address—one of my neighbors had probably hired caterers for a birthday party. 

“Excuse me,” I said.

Neither of them took any notice of me.

“You’ve got the wrong house,” I said, waving my arms around.

“HELLO?” I shouted. They didn’t react at all. Now it was becoming unsettling.

The bearded chef opened my fridge and began rummaging around.

“Hey, what the hell!” I shouted, crossing the room to wrestle a carton of eggs from him. “I already told you people—”

Without saying a word, he ripped the carton away from me using both hands, then he cracked two eggs into a bowl and started whisking.

""That does it,"" I grabbed my phone, planning to call the police. But then the bearded chef started rummaging through my carefully arranged spice rack. 

“HEY!”

As I made my way towards him, the dark-haired chef pursed his lips then selected a jar.

I stood right next to him. “Okay, that's enough. You people need to—”

He made a ‘one-minute' gesture, then he circled the counter and resumed chopping.

At my wit’s end, I grabbed a ladle and pot and bashed them together. It made a deafening metallic clang. The two chefs stopped what they were doing and finally turned their attention towards me. 

“Look, I think you’ve got the wrong house, okay? Can you please just—""

The dark-haired chef approached me and snatched the ladle. “There’s no time for this nonsense—we’ve gotta get cooking!”

He opened one of the drawers and pulled out a large knife.

I groaned. “COOKING WHAT?”

He smirked, advancing upon me. A chill ran along my spine. I traveled backward until I bumped into the bearded chef.

I gulped. With a weak voice, I said, “Cooking wh—""

Before I could finish, the bearded chef’s hand clamped down over my face, smothering my mouth.

The dark-haired chef took a step forward and held the knife against my throat. “Cooking *you*.”",1620443890.0

I had to wear a PPE kit for work. I dropped my keys when I tried to put them in my pocket, when I bent down to pick them up, I found a pair of little boots. I presumed they belonged to a toddler.

I picked them up and put them in the evidence bag, and continued to work on the wood chipper. I changed the victim count to 4.

The forest story..,10,3,"'*Long ago, a young girl went with her mother to pick berries for her father, who was hard at work.

#

 But the forest greeted them with a dark, cold silence, the bushes empty.

#

Yet determined to find the berries, the child broke free from her mother's grasp and vanished deeper into the woods.

#

Her mother's worried cries faded fast as the girl ran on; over vine and under branch and into the forest deep.

#

Feeling like someone was watching her, the child recalled her mother's scary bedtime tales, and her throat became bone dry.

#

A creature appeared and turned his blood into wine. ""Come little one, quench your thirst,"" he said menacingly. So she drank the red cold wine and smiled with joy..

#

Passing through a graveyard, a menacing storm was approaching, and the air turned chillingly cold, the girl was shivering in her worn out, thin clothes.

#

Then a mysterious weaver appeared, and with a click of his long fingers, created a beautiful dress, fit for royalty, matching the wine she carried so fondly. ""Come child,"" he coaxed, ""warm yourself,"" and so she did and smiled yet again.

#

After wondering the ocean for a few hours, hoping to see a glimpse of land, she spotted a beautiful palace on a massive island. As the little girl stepped inside, She was approached by a king, gesturing at the buffet that awaited to be eaten. ""You look starved, child, come and eat your fill! "" He boomed mysteriously. But the girl ate the food anyway, and smiled once more..

#

After approaching land, she soon entered the forest's dark heart, Bearing the sweet juicy berries that she was searching for, in the center of the weaving vines.

#

The child carelessly took the berries, thinking that it would complete the royal treatment.

#

She was wrong. instead, her wine turned to blood, the dress was itching to an unbearable degree, and the magical vines snatched her away, suffocating her as they curled up around her body..

Rabbitland,44,4,"I woke up with a collar wrapped around my neck. It was made of hard, solid, metal, and it felt as cold as ice against my skin. I tried taking it off. It wouldn’t budge.

I didn’t know who I am, either. All I could remember was burning the fur off my puppy with a blowtorch because he wasn’t listening to me.

“Here Mocha Mocha Mocha!”

*My name’s not Mocha!*

Somebody loomed over me, somebody with long hind legs and even longer ears. *Is that a rabbit?*

It called me again. Mocha. Is that my name now?

When I refused to budge, it took out a long, gleaming whip. It cracked against the walls of my cage. It came down again, harder this time on my neck, and it felt like somebody was holding a searing hot iron against my neck.

I hissed, my eyes watering with the pain.

The rabbit opened the cage and raised its whip again. I learned not to hesitate. I immediately raced out.

“Good boy!” said the rabbit, looping a leash around my collar. “Time for walkies!""

“Let me go!” I cried, hoping to reason with this rabbit. “I don’t want to be here.”

The whip lashed out again. “Bad human!” cried the rabbit. “No talking back to Master!”

Feeling absolutely humiliated, I allowed the rabbit to take me out of the house, leashed. I was naked and chained up, forced to crawl on my hands and knees. If I ever stepped out of line, I was whipped again.

The rabbit took me all the way to the supermarket, where a bell chimed. Fresh produce lined the shelf, all carrots and radishes and healthy things to eat. The rabbit hummed as it dragged me alongside itself, while picking up the things it needed. I was ravenous by then, absolutely starving, and looking at all the food made my stomach rumble.

Then we passed by the meat section and my stomach churned.

The meat was pink and raw and still had their skin on. Some still had fingernails attached to it. The hands, detached from the bones, looked like wizened claws. They were all packaged neatly in those little styrofoam boxes, but they looked like they could be cut straight out of my skin.

The rabbit stopped when it saw the meat options. It turned towards me, its eyes glazed over.

It seemed no longer interested in keeping me as a pet. Hunger dripped from its eyes.",1620493181.0
The Obituary Dream,13,4,"When I was eight I dreamed of the bike I would get when I turned ten. When I was thirteen I dreamed of the girl I would kiss when I was fourteen. I recognized her when I met her a year after that dream. She kissed me, though, sometimes dreams are backwards.

When I was seventeen I dreamed about getting beaten up. I didn't mouth off when I met those guys, and they beat me up anyway. When I was twenty-one I dreamed of the woman I would marry and as soon as I met her I dreamed of our children.

Most of my dreams predicted their milestones in life. I came to rely upon my dreams to always be prepared for them. They knew their dad could see the future, somehow, and it made them behave themselves.

Good kids. I dreamed I would have a grandchild in a few more years. But I cannot see anything that happens, just hearing people telling me I have a granddaughter. Weird.

I had a dream last night that finally made me understand. I am very afraid, because nothing prepared me for this. Hell, I am only going-on-forty. I thought I had lot of time left. There was a lot I had left to do, and now I am panicked. The terror of my dreams has my mind in denial.

Dreams cannot see into the future. I cannot see the future, that's insane. I must be insane!

For I dreamed of my obituary, six days from now. It was just a dream, and I am not trembling in fear. I'm going to go mow the lawn, now.",1620515395.0
Unwilling participant.,25,3,"  

Like with everyone else, the covid pandemic has been hard on me. Not only did I lose my job, but I found out my girlfriend had been cheating on me with my best friend for months and I am due to eviction because I have no money to pay the rent. I tried searching for jobs, but because of the pandemic no jobs were available. It went so far that I tried reaching out to friends and my family, but none was willing to help me.

That was how I found the ad. *Are you in desperate need of money? Has the covid pandemic been hard on you? We offer a price of 1000,000$ if you partake in our experiment. If you are interested, call the number, and sign up.*

I laughed at the ad, knowing it was a scam but a small part of me hoped it was real. Then rational and logical thinking struck. If it was real, what is the downside? It is probably a sick science experiment. Then my greed stepped in. It is easy money; you can at least call the number to see if its real. Unfortunately, my greed won, and what I did next turned out to be the biggest mistake I have ever made.

I called the number.

After just under four signals, a female voice responded.

“Hello. Do you wish to sign up for the experiment?” 

I remained silent for a few moments, not expecting an answer.

“Hello? Are you still there?”

What the hell I thought and sighed deeply.

“Hello. Yes, I want to sign up for the experiment.”

“Excellent, wait a minute while I connect you. 

While I waited my body got struck by a powerful feeling of unease and my subconsciousness told me to hang up… and I did.

I decided to forget all about it and went on with my day. At 10 pm I went to bed.

I gasped as I woke up, crying out in pain as every inch of my body throbbed in pain and the hard stone floor did not help to alleviate the pain. I do not know how long it took for me to gather the strength to get up, but luckily at the time my eyes had adjusted to the darkness surrounding the room.  I could vividly see contours of… people chained to the wall. I let out a loud yelp when a female voice boomed through the room.

One Way Trip,26,0,"My shirt is soaking. It's clinging to my chest. I look down at my body which is when I realise my legs are carrying me on a jog.

It's strange, because I don’t usually run at night. This doesn’t feel like exercise either. I’m running away from something. Or running towards something.

The terrain is uneven. Some footfalls stick in the ground longer than they should, as though I’m pressing into sand. The feeling starts to spread, inching up my ankles.

Past my knees.

Up my thighs.

The lower half of my body is passing through sludge whilst the top half flails pathetically, an overgrown fish pleading to go home.

I twist my head around to see if the thing that might be chasing is near.

Nothing.

I turn back around and - 

My legs catch up with the rest of my body and I tumble, causing me to jerk in my bed so forcefully that I crash out of it. My full force hits the pint of water on the floor and a shard of glass slides into my neck.

Blood gushes. I lay there, too shocked to move. It's still night. It will always be night.

Apparitions,10,1,"You wake up screaming in the pitch-blackness of your bedroom. What was that dream? An all consuming sensation of dread made flesh? Sweat pours down your face, and suddenly you notice them. Pale figures hovering over your bed. 

You fill your lungs with air, only to come to the realisation that you can’t remember how to scream. You can’t remember how to utter meaningful words. The figures draw closer, hollow moans now filling your ears. 

For some reason your limbs are limp and unresponsive. Are you still dreaming? Is this sleep paralysis? Your mind feels damp and foggy, like there’s a heavy veil drawn over it, and panic rises as the pale figures slowly descend on you. 

You manage to lift a frail, shaking hand, flailing it around you wildly. The ghostly figures retreat, but soon enough they descend on you again. A deep incessant murmur creeps into your ears. 

The figures all seem so vivid now, like faces coming out of a thick mist. You recognize them, you think, but the fog on your mind is just so heavy. What are they? Who are they? Your inability to answer these questions fills you with unbridled dread. 

“Don’t be afraid,” the voices say. 

“You’re safe”. 

You don’t trust them. This is all wrong. Who are they? Who are you? Tears stream down your face, and your pained sobs are unfamiliar and bestial. 

“Calm down, please,” the figures growl as you lash out at them. But you won’t calm down. This isn’t right. Where are you? Who are they? 

“We need help here!” 

You try to calm down. You try to ignore them. This is just a dream. An unimaginably vivid dream. You’re all right. It’s a monday. You remember breakfast. Sunny weather. A warm breeze.

“Please,” you whisper. “Please, I don’t know who I am.”

“What’s going on here?” they murmur.

“Oh, it’s just another episode.”

Headline,6,1,"I don't sleep anymore. I lie awake staring into nothing, if I close my eyes I see the headline, if my eyes are open I hear the words. I cannot get rid of them, I have tried. 
I walk the halls of this hollow, silent house, peering into their rooms. I know once there were photos and trinkets but I can only remember them in small bursts and then they are gone. 
I try so hard to grab onto those moments but no matter what I do, they evaporate, so I walk the halls hoping for brief glimpses of them. Of who they were. 
I know it's not healthy and I have tried so, so many times to leave the house but I can't. The moment I touch the front door I am consumed by a dread I cannot fathom. I don't know what will happen out there to me and I don't know that I want to find out. 
In the house I can at least find comfort in those small moments when I see something familiar and it keeps me here.
It often feels like it's been only moments, hours, sometimes years since I saw the headline. It is difficult to keep track. I know people have stopped coming by and the phone no longer rings. But I can't fault anyone, it would be difficult to listen to a person wail inconsolably day in and day out. 
So I spend my days walking the halls, peering into their rooms, occasionally I sit at the dining table we shared and try to remember what we ate or spoke of. It is so hard to find those memories when my mind only wants to speak the headline. 
Back and forth, in and out of the rooms. Waiting for, anything. For someone maybe to come by. I hear voices outside once in a while and try to see them from the window but they are like quiet hushes in a fall breeze. A whisper of sound so faint I feel I must be imagining it. It is a comfort to think others are near. I think I hear talk of selling homes and wonder if neighbors are moving but there are no for sale signs. No crowds coming to look. Maybe there are, it is hard to keep track. It's nice to think of a new family coming to their new home, to start a new chapter in their life.
And then I see the headline again, ""father and children killed in accident"". And I remember, no one is coming home to me. It is a continuous loop of thought I can not break. 
Sometimes, when a memory is strong, I remember the other headline, ""grieving mother found dead in home"". 
No one tells you there are no cross overs, no reunification if you are separate at death.
I know they are out there, but I am here. In this home trying to find solace in vague memories, alone.",1620515776.0

Need a Ride?,9,2,"I picked up a hitch hiker.

I picked up a hitch hiker.

My mother’s words rang in my ears.

*The only ones who walk the road are the truly desperate and the truly lost.* 

*Neither makes for good company.*

Rain beat my windscreen with such an unrelenting ferocity that I thought it might shatter. 

My knuckles were white on the wheel. Ten and two, ten and two.

I kept my eyes locked on the road. A long and solitary stretch. A place for the rain and the rock. A place no person belonged.

Try as I might, I couldn’t stop my eyes from drifting to soaking creature I had picked up.

It hadn’t said a word. Hadn’t moved a muscle.

Rain dripped from its’ leather skin, over a bulky backpack. When it moved with the rumbling of the road, I could hear the clanking of wicked metal. 

The sound made my skin crawl.

As the lightning cracked the rampaging sky the creature finally moved. It reached into the bag, taking out an apple as red as blood and a knife as long as my hand.

Wordlessly it stuck the blade into the flesh of the fruit. 

The wet slicing carved at my death grip composure.

Hoarding breath I fixed my eyes on the road. 

I pressed my foot down hard. The car roared into the deafening storm, gaining speed.

I could hear the creature feasting. A menacing crunching, on bones or men.

The car devoured the road with a terrible hunger. 

I could feel the tyres threatening to slip, I pressed harder.

If the creature feared what I might do, it didn’t show.

What I might do.

I felt myself sitting on the fence. Ahead was throwing us off the road, into oblivion. Behind was the unimaginable.

My heart raced and my mind pleaded. Yesterday I was safe and loved and miles away from this godforsaken road. 

Now I was drifting between worlds with the riverman as my companion.

Thunder and lightning built into a deafening crescendo, outraged I would give passage to the unforgivable.

I looked out of the car, maybe for help, maybe for deliverance. Lightning silhouetted the indifferent beyond.

The sky had forsaken me.

In the corner of my eye I could see the creature discard the core of its’ apple out the window, into the abyss.

Raising the blade up and out of sight I heard the sound of knife against skin. Edge drawing sideways against its’ hide.

I almost shuddered. Almost.

I could tell the creature got joy my reactions.

All at once, I slammed on the brakes. 

The tyres let out a sound which drowned out the storm. The ear piercing wail of flaming mares at the gates of hell.

We skidded for forever before we stopped.

The start of the National Anthem on the T.V. was drowned out by the shrill ringing of my phone. I ignored it as the pitter-patter of my son’s feet came scrambling down the hall, and I only managed to turn in time to catch him as he leaped into my arms.

“Daddy won, Daddy won!” he beamed, his smile as bright as his eyes.

I couldn’t help but cry as I held my son against me. We finally made it. We’d won. Setting him down, I called my father back to let him know that I had indeed been the winner. The call only lasted a few minutes, but the feeling of his happiness for us lasted the entire night.
 
The next morning came in a rush. My son strutted in his navy-blue suit as he watched himself in our little bathroom mirror. It wasn’t extravagant, but next to my hand-me-down tux he looked quite handsome. After a few exhausting minutes of coaxing him away from the mirror, we stepped outside and began our half-mile walk to the local station. People lined the street, cheering for us. Hugs and handshakes limited our progress, but nothing could dampen our smiles. Beads were draped around our necks as we moved up the silver steps and entered the colossal building. Their jingle announced our arrival.
          
“Mister Lemmings, if you’d follow me please.”

I turned to the voice to see a male attendant. He smiled politely then ushered us into a small room occupied by two chairs and an older gentleman. He briefly glanced up before writing in his notebook, a frown plastered on his face.

“Identification. And state your names”. 

His voice was deep but not-unpleasant.

“A-A-Andrew Lemmings. A-Adam Lemmings”, I managed with a stutter, handing him our papers.

Glancing over our papers briefly, he relaxed. His frown was quickly replaced by a proud smile, easing the tension I hadn’t realized was present.

“Excellent! If you don’t mind, please follow me into the processing room. There you’ll receive your blessing!”

I smiled and picked up Adam, carrying him as we moved into a small room with a single plane of glass dividing the center. The gentleman turned, and shook my hand.

“Bless the Mothers!” he exclaimed, then left through the way we came in.

“Daddy, is it finally time to see Mommy?” my son asked, eyes alight in hope.

Even Marble Crumbles,117,10,"I was working on the sculpture when the first city disappeared.

The voice in my ears was as calm as it ever was as it reported the news, as if it were just another outage or temporary travel problem. A city had gone missing, leaving a few scattered buildings around the edges and nothing more. It was being investigated, of course, but there was a secondary problem - no one, not even those who had been in those last few buildings, could remember anything clear about the city. Its name, who had been there, anything.

I tried to remember if I knew anyone who lived out there, and drew a blank. I had to hope it was because I was an introvert, and no other reason.

The voice reassured me that a solution would be found soon, an answer. I looked over the photos of the site, the strange square hole and the cut-through buildings of ivory and gold, and I did my best to believe it.

In the end, I went back to work, drawing the delicate vanes of feathers in the marble. What else was I to do?

Days passed, weeks, months. Reports on the investigation became more sporadic, especially as nothing new came from it. I think most people wanted to forget, to go back to their private worlds. Discomfort was an unfamiliar feeling.

But the city was not the last.

It was a trickle, at first, and then a flood. More square holes found in pristine, endless forests, or bisecting palaces and mansions, or even once in the middle of the ocean, crystal-clear water endlessly running into it and disappearing. And more, too. Writers reporting angrily that hundreds of their books had been turned into gibberish. People collapsing, frozen, staring at nothing, sometimes coming to, more often not. The sky going from night to day and back in rapid flashes. 

The calm voice that told me the news never faltered, but there were less reassurances of answers, less promises of understanding.

I finished the sculpture. I did not start another. Part of me, familiar, said I had time. After a month or a year or a decade I could begin again.

I think, even then, another part of me knew I would never finish another work.

I was out in the gardens when the end came, among ever-blooming flowers and the legacy of all my years of work. My latest - my last - rose in the center, a manmade angel, wings spread, hands raised in blessing or prayer.

The way the terrible rainbow light of the flickering, distorted sky reflected against her was beautiful.

Eons ago, there was another world, with banks of computers and endless flashing lights, with pods for us each to enter, with the promise of an eternity.

But now our heaven is falling, and I suspect that, after all this time, there is no one left to hold it up.

Humane Alternative,37,13,"Leon marched down the dingy, featureless hallway in shackles, two guards trailing him. He had been ripped from the street yesterday evening, then housed and fed in a dormitory with other transients. While that was a pleasant change from the usual struggle to survive, he was becoming uneasy.

He turned briefly to look behind him. ""Hey, guys...where are we going?""

One guard snorted. ""Oh, look...it can talk.""

Leon flinched angrily. ""Hey, I'm just as much of a person as you are!""

The other guard laughed. ""Not like *us* at all. Just keep marching. You'll find out soon enough."" The other brandished a taser, the sparks flying across the gap menacingly. Leon swallowed and approached the door at the end of the hall. It opened for him.

Leon found himself in a small auditorium, on the stage, watched by a packed audience. Several clean-cut people in white lab coats, surrounding some sort of metal rack, smiled at him expectantly as he was led towards them. He heard a little girl cry out ""Oh, he's so *cute*! Mommy, he almost looks *human*!"" Her mother shushed her. ""No, sweetie. But he *used* to be.""

His shackles were released, and rubber-gloved hands moved his hands to a pair of handles. An instant after grabbing them, he felt a minor electrical current seize up his muscles. Although he couldn't move, he could still see and hear, and he felt a rush of terror burst from his chest and flood into all his extremities.

A distinguished older gentleman spoke. ""And now, we come to the highlight of our presentation. This is Leon; he's been homeless for two years, in and out of jail for a rash of assaults and petty thefts. He's addicted to *three* different drugs, is riddled with parasites, and has reneged on his child support. He can't take care of himself, or anyone else, and resources to care for *all* unwanted people are dwindling! We offer a more humane alternative to the terrible life he's leading.""

Leon felt a mechanical box approach the front of his pelvis, slicing through his ragged clothes. ""Our technique is safe, affordable, and is ready to be deployed all across the nation."" An icy spray soaked his testicles; they went numb in seconds. ""It will prevent overpopulation, save taxpayer dollars, and conserve food."" Through the numbness, he could feel a mechanical gripper lift his penis. ""It will reduce or eliminate undesirable, aggressive behavior, as well as hormone-related moodiness."" Was something cutting through his scrotum? ""Plus, he never has to worry about testicular cancer!"" A few giggles erupted from the audience as something seemed to sew his skin together. ""We hope to make this treatment mandatory for anyone that can't demonstrate the ability to support themselves, or follow society's rules.""

The box withdrew with a flourish. The audience gasped. The older gentleman looked at Leon's pelvis with alarm. There was nothing left but a bare nub. He cleared his throat. ""There are bound to be minor glitches at first...""",1620465960.0

Melding,63,10,"The meteor fell from space, but it’s not like we have any definitive idea from where. 


Researchers didn’t investigate until the missing person reports piled up. Police that went to investigate the town never came back. Strange creatures were seen running around, described as “a bunch of people put together”.


The meteor radiated some strange sound into the air around it. The more researchers investigated, the louder the sounds became, until the frequency began to affect them.


They melded. The first man to change grasped onto another in a frenzied panic, only for his arm to sink into his friend, melded them at a cellular level. Other researchers tried to separate them and only got themselves caught into the clump, and soon they had to be contained and kept away from other people. 


It didn’t just meld them physiologically. When interviewed, the mass of researchers identified itself as every individual that comprised it, having a range of memories and experiences that used to only belong to a specific individual. Whatever was left of their minds had all been merged into one, rending them all utterly insane, but still coherent and alive. 


The clump escaped containment, causing the melding of several more researchers and civilians around the area. Normal weapons didn’t kill it, only slowed it down. Soon the clump of people had engulfed the state, any survivors were to be put down, just in case they had any trace of what became known as “The Melding” within them.


Multiple clumps of melded people escaped the state, attempting to merge with any and all other people they could find. Fire scared them, but didn’t actually do any damage. Some of the clumps would scream, some would sing, others would speak incoherently, even more would moan in ecstasy, as if this were the best outcome for them. 

I’m typing this at my work station. I can hear a few clumps outside, I can hear people screaming as they join The Melded. All it takes is one touch, and it’s over. They’re outside the halls right now, muttering to themselves.


*It’sSoWarmIt’sSoColdWontYouJoinUsBeSoBold*


*BelieveMeWhenISayICarryAllOfMySins*


*ItHurtsSoMuchButI’veNeverBeenHappier*


I’ve got a small pistol, with a few bullets at my house. It’ll be tough to sneak out the office and drive through the clumps, but it’s the best chance I got. I’m gonna put a bullet in my head, and hopefully that’ll prevent me from melding with these *things.* 


If you’re reading this, even if you think it’s fiction, I suggest doing the same. 


Just because The Melded haven’t gotten to where you live yet, doesn’t mean they won’t. 


Give yourself a quick death, whatever you become after Melding can’t be any worse than whatever comes after life.

Sometimes I forget.,13,0,"It's been 2 months since it happened. I can't say i'm entirely bothered by it though. Sometimes I don't remember hearing the news. I remember feeling sad, yet happy. I can't say I was bothered by it because I knew it wasn't the end. I still had conversations with her when I visited her, despite there being a tube in her throat. Her eyes told me fairy tales, but behind those fairy tales stood a sad, ominous truth. But I distinctly remember us talking. And she told me when it was time. But, after it happened she would still talk to me. But this time she would say the same thing. 'Red... Place.' 'Red... Place.' I'll admit, it kept me awake some nights. One day, after saying 'Red Place' a hundred times she told me that she can escape the 'Red Place' for an item. I asked her what item she needed and she said ""Darla..."" Darla was my mom's name. My parents and I never had a good relationship so my grandma was pretty much my real mom. So one day she got into a horrible accident. Her brake lines were cut and she crashed into a pickup.


Now me and grandma can keep having conversations like we used to.",1620459349.0
One Summer,22,6,"When I was round about ten or eleven I stayed the night at my friend Jake’s house. In rural Illinois all the farmhouses are a good mile apart. ‘Cept for me ‘n Jake's. His house was close. Didn’t use ta be. His family rebuilt right across from us after their old house burnt down coupla years ago. We were playin under the big old oak tree by his new house when Jake had an idea.

“Hey, wanna go see the old house?”

I put my truck back down in the grass and looked out at the thick green soy fields.

“Ain’t it kinda far?”

“Naw, you can almost see it. Just a bit past those trees,” he said, pointing.

“OK.”

“Shouldn’t cut through the fields, though. Let’s walk to the driveway.”

We traipsed down the road till we reached the narrow dirt drive that led to the old house. Wispy clouds scooted overhead in no great hurry to wherever they were headin. It was hot as the devil’s own sittin room, but we marched along in the dust until we could see the copse of thin dogwoods Jake had pointed out.

A lotta the house was still standin. You could see where the fire had started at the foundation. Black talons of soot still clawed up the faded blue siding graspin at the empty bedroom windows. We poked around the blackened timbers and kicked at the brittle mortar of the chimney bricks.

“Hey, you wanna play hide ‘n seek?” Jake asked.

“OK.”

“OK! I’ll go over to the trees and count!” he yelled over his shoulder racin away.

I ran around back of the skeletal ruins and looked for a hidin place. The double doors to the cellar caught my eye. Couldn’t see a dang thing past the first few steps but I pulled the doors back over me anyhow. I heard a distant “ready er not, here I come!” and giggled. A blade of light cut between the double doors and after a minute or so my eyes got used to the dark. The cellar was just an empty concrete room with a big support beam in the middle. The light blinked out and in as a shadow that looked bigger'n' Jake's should be passed outside. I crawled under the stairs and soon I heard somethin scrapin on the doors then nothin at all. Figurin they were too heavy for Jake to lift I ventured up the stairs and tried to lift the doors. They wouldn’t budge. I saw a steel bar cuttin across the light on the outside.

“Jake…? Jake!?”

“What?”

I jumped a bit and turned toward the big beam in the middle of the cellar. I crept down the stairs and skirted along the walls, my eyes never leavin the beam. Jake’s wrists were shackled with long chains to the top of the beam.

“You spendin the night?” he asked.",1620446547.0
Heart for two,29,0,"I haven't slept properly in three days. I have been in a psychiatric hospital for a month now, but I am still afraid to sleep. The same nightmare that had haunted me all my life began to progress after what I had done.

It all started when I was 16. A certain person began to come to me in my dreams. I rarely had good dreams, but after I dreamed of this particular person, I woke up with cold sweat all over my body. His crooked gestures and movements, his bent neck and spine, his scarred face, this image is firmly embedded in my mind. Every day he began to come more often, I began to hear his eerie voice: ""Give me your heart.""

I had one child in the family. My parents loved me and were always with me, but I still felt lonely. As a child, I asked them more than once for a brother, but they refused with stern faces. With the same faces, they forbade me to look into the attic, where old books and photographs were kept.

After a short lull, I had a nightmare again. He reappeared, this time I could see his empty pupils. He tried to grab me with the words: ""Give me back my heart, give me back my body, give me back my life that you took."" Then I began to understand that he was closely connected with me and that my parents were hiding something from me.

Instead of asking questions, I decided to go up to the attic myself. Looking in old documents, I began to find things from which I began to slowly go crazy. A creepy photo of the twins. Siamese twins. An old birth certificate with the exact same diagnosis. I already clearly knew who was in this photo - me and him, a man who was in my nightmares. From the letters in the envelope, I learned that my parents decided to separate us for a lot of money, only the result of the operation was like this - only one could live. And apparently they agreed.

That night I could not sleep, I was afraid to fall asleep after learning the truth, but I fell asleep. In a dream I saw how separated us. Eerie screams were heard throughout the hospital, faceless doctors did not leave us, the nightmare ended when one of us stopped screaming. 

Having completely lost my mind, having learned the truth, I finished off my parents with a cleaver, surrendered to the police, sat in court and, due to my insanity, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. I thought that now my twin would leave me alone, but he only came more often and became even angrier. I think this is due to the fact that he always loved our parents and hated me. He stayed with me forever. It was as if we had never been separated. We were one.",1620437857.0
Snowfall,57,4,"There is something out there that looks like snow, feels like snow but isn't snow. It has adapted to the new conditions of our world and hunts us with an acute ferocity. Evolution gives the smartest beasts the upper hand.

This planet, our once green and blue emerald, is now a white pearl. The climate is now arctic throughout: the dying Sun is killing the Earth. Death replaces life. Most species are extinct. The ones that remain hunt the ones that remain.

One creature is King of the hunt. It feeds on its prey from below, camouflaged as snowfall.

I first came across them during the massacre of America. Thousands of the things slaughtering the desperate masses, the knived hands of the monsters skewering and slicing the weak, frozen refugees. The crowds were butchered, cut into consumable chunks before being sucked into their awful maws.

I was with my little brother that day, watching from the window of a dilapidated townhouse. Luckily, we had decided to stay on for a little longer rather than migrate.

Have I ever seen one in the full? Not yet and I don't know anyone who has. I've caught a glimpse of their icy blades and their twisted mouths. Rumours abound about their origin but none are believable.

We have since stuck to the frozen waterways. This snow gently settles as a fine dust on the thick ice and the monsters, for now, only hide in the denser stuff. Most boats are at the bottom, crushed by Winter's fists.

My brother is cold. I am cold. We walk slowly and steadily over the frozen lake towards a distant cannery plant in the hope of food and shelter.

Feet-thick snow separates the lake and the building. We are starving.

When we reach the hidden shore of the lake, I throw some of our trigger stones and watch them sink into the snow. This doesn't always work but sometimes the creatures react.

Four stones. Nothing.

We place our feet into the crunching snow and proceed slowly. We are both frightened to death but also hungry and frostbitten.

One step.

Two steps.

Three steps through the snowfall.

The snow ten metres in front of us crumbles. We strand motionless. My brother looks at me terrified, mouthing the word ""No"" over and over.

Ahead of us, we hear the whining cackle associated with the snow chameleons. My brother's gloved hand grabs mine and squeezes it. I put my finger to my lip.

Then, something unexpected happens. One of the creatures raises itself up out of its hide. What I was looking at was impossible to comprehend. We would never have won against these things.

My brother huddled closer but the creature remained still, cruelly but respectfully standing, waiting for us to react.

The temperature was dropping rapidly. Twilight approached.

I gripped my brother's hand and told him that I would never let go of it.

And through the snowfall, and as brothers, we would fight and die like men.",1620413585.0
I'm trying to understand Reginald's anger,9,2,"
I'm trying to understand Reginald's anger because it is quite unusual and like language, anger is a language that is the most misunderstood. Reginald came to me all angry and punching objects and as I tried to console him I asked him what was wrong. Reginald's shouted ""I got robbed by someone who was poor and uneducated. Why couldn't I get robbed by someone who was well educated and rich!"" And Reginald then shouted ""Barry got robbed by some one who was a Harvard educated graduate and rich it's not fair!"" And I really struggled to understand why Reginald was angry. He wasn't so angry at being robbed but he was angry at the fact that where the robber was born into and who he was.

I mean I could understand Ronald's anger another guy who came to me angry. Ronald was angry at the fact that he tried to murder his friends dogs but got caught and got battered. That kind of anger is understandable and straight forward as I can relate to it. Reginald's anger was harder to read and when he came to me another day all angry and hot headed, Reginald explained to me why he was angry. Reginald said ""I'm angry because I am being stalked by some low life homeless man. Why can't I be stalked by some respectable hard working person who rose up through the ranks? I mean Sally Noreen is being stalked by a respectable hard working person who is really high on the council""

Once again Reginald was angry at not the fact that he was being stalked but rather the occupation of his stalker. He has a weird sort of anger and I find his anger quite peculiar to be honest. I mean Reginalds anger is unexplainable compared to someone like Kale, another angry fella who was angry at the fact that he failed to burn his father alive so that he could have his inheritance money, but finely failed. That sort of anger I could relate to and understand.

Then a couple of days ago Reginald came into my office shouting ""hooter, Marcus and Crawford have all been murdered by respectable rich individuals. I'm probably going to get murdered by some low life scum who is worth nothing. I want to be murdered by someone who is worth something!"" And as I listened, I was just so utterly confused by this and I had nothing to say.

I mean Reginald's anger is confusing compared Roberto's anger who is another angry fella who came into my office because he blames his parents for giving birth to him. His supportive parents have tried to murder him many times on the wishes of Roberto. Though half way through the murder it's always either that his parents stop or he himself (Roberto) wants to stop being murdered on the 100th try and the whole cycle repeats again. I can relate and understand this anger unlike Reginald's anger.",1620447326.0
Tommy’s Confession Letter,18,1,"


Mom,


Thanks. Since Dad died, don't worry about me anymore. I’m going to a better place. I’m going to Hell for what I did to Denise and her unborn baby. Mom, I did something bad, really bad. I don’t deserve forgiveness. I thought I was a real man, human, but I wasn’t. I'm not, despite college and friends, a life ahead of me. Except for once: I’ve seen a lot of girls (my age), more than I should, but Denise? Denise was different. She was fun and smart. She had a kind heart. Something in her just made me happy. We had it going for a few months. A month ago I took Denise to see that Lord of the Rings' Hobbit. 

That’s when she told me. A baby. I wasn’t ready for that. 

Then Denise started talking about the baby’s name. Never seen her that happy. I told her nothing. I couldn't. I can't. Fast forward one week. We drove back from a night-out with friends. In my head, I couldn’t stop. It was too much. So I pulled over to a gas station. I could still see it, hear it, feel it. Rascal Flatt’s ‘My Wish’ was playing, it was ten at night. 

‘What’s wrong, Tommy?’

'I'll be back.’

I walked into the store. Bought a pack of cigarettes and came back. 

We drove away. I lowered the volume. Time passed.

‘Tommy, you’re being quiet tonight.’

I didn’t answer. My palms were already sweaty. My heart was killing me with dread shit. 

‘Tommy?’

I fucking didn’t want to answer. I must’ve drove a little more than 45 mph. A STOP sign. I don’t remember stopping.

‘Slow down!’

Finally I pulled onto the side of the road. 

Denise was angry. ‘What the fuck?!’

I snapped.  ‘Why can’t you abort the baby, Dennie?’

Denise sat there in shock.

I slammed my hands on the steering wheel. ‘Why?’

‘Tommy, I thought--’

‘Shut up!’ 

At that point, I swore she cried. I continue the drive home. 

We didn’t talk to each other after that. In fact, that’s the last time we talked.

We came home and went to sleep. Denise had already told me she planned to go home the next day. She slept on the couch. What happened after I don’t remember much except for some details -- seeing Denise’s face and standing there like a fucking idiot. She looked peaceful, mom. So peaceful. And I failed her. Them both. Dad wasn’t around much and I was afraid, afraid of becoming like him. I didn't deserve this baby. I didn't deserve Denise. They deserve better. Denise never felt so soft and heavy. God, I hated myself. I hated getting their blood on me, hated smelling bleach. I fucking hate myself. I smoked all the cigarettes in two days. Denise? The baby? I’ll tell you where they are:

Dan’s backyard. He felt bad for me. Take it out on me, not him.

I’m going out.

I love you.

Daddy's Chainsaw,1115,70,"Daddy’s Chainsaw is a rusty abomination. All teeth and noise and bone-splintering force, spewing smoke and coughing discordantly as it cuts through all the layers. Spilling the stuff and squishing the insides. You can see it staring at you from the corner in the garage. Shiny beady eyes. Metal grin. Scarred and disfigured. Old and evil.

It’s never dormant. Not really. It’s always hungry, you see. Always needs more. Can’t leave it alone. It will crawl out on grimy, tarnished joints, and you will never see it coming. Jolt awake to the sound of your guts turning to liquid. Scream into the deafening roar of the chain. Convulse as it digs deeper and deeper, uncovering all those things that are meant to be on the inside. 

That’s why I sit here. As long as I keep an eye on it, we will be OK. As long as we watch it, it can’t move. Old laws long forgotten, but somehow instinctively followed. Awaken unseen, move unseen, murder unseen.

Biting Must Be Bad,58,8,"  

My earliest memories are of the water bowl, its silvery metallic surface and wide flange. Spike was a hearty drinker, too. I used to watch him drink with amazement, amazement at how much water he could move into his mouth with that big tongue of his. Of course, he was a lot bigger than me, being a pit bull and all. I was just a young mutt—at least that’s what the Masters always called me.

Spike used to snap at me if I’d try to drink when he was around, so I’d have to wait until he was finished. He slobbered a lot, too; there was always a film on the surface of the water—but I got used to it.

Feeding time was always an anxiety inciter as well. If Spike was protective of the water bowl, he was super protective of the food dish. He nipped me hard enough to draw blood on several occasions when I’d tried to sneak me a bite while he was eating. Eventually, the Masters got me my own dish, and they’d almost always feed us at the same time. Otherwise, Spike would eat all of his food and then eat mine. The Masters were smart that way.

Eventually I got bigger, and me and Spike, we became better friends. I think it had something to do with the fact that I had grown as much as I had and could come closer to holding my own. I didn’t wait on him to drink anymore, either, and he didn’t snap at me the way he used to. He’d wait his turn—like friends should.

He also came to be very protective of me. On the rare occasions we got out of the fenced-in yard, when we’d come across other dogs, he’d always put himself between me and them—wouldn’t let them get close to me. That made me feel good.

One day, the female Master brought one of her friends over for supper. They ate, laughed a lot, and then they fed Spike—but they didn’t feed me. I was confused, so confused I made a huge mistake—or so it seems now.

The lady Master’s friend reached down toward me like maybe she meant to pet me; but I didn’t know what she was up to because I was confused and really hungry—so I bit her hand. I bit it hard, too, hard enough to draw blood. Then there was a lot of scolding, a lot of apologizing to the lady, and then she left. It was a bad rest of the night. They never did give me my supper.

The next day several policemen showed up with some people from Child Protective Services. The Child Protective Services People took me away, and that night I had to sleep in a strange house in a bedroom with two other children. I’m still confused. I don’t like it here. I miss Spike.",1620396730.0

Her teeth are quite yellowed and brown.

“Evie was great, as usual. Such a pleasure to have her in class,” I reply politely, while my finger finds the silent alarm beneath the countertop. I quietly activate it. The alarm both locks the front door and warns my coworkers to get the children into our soundproofed “movie room,” as we’ve practiced way too many times prior.

“Excellent.” She peruses the room with greedy and expectant eyes. I bet she can already imagine the taste of little Evie’s tender flesh…

I don't actually do that, of course. Instead, I step through the doorway, reach up and grab one of the wall-mounted, silver-bullet-loaded Glocks.  Calming my nerves, I then take a deep breath, count to five, and pop back through the door to double-tap two slugs through its forehead. 

The good thing about this variety of shapeshifter is that they really don’t bleed much, which makes cleanup a jiffy.

Riddle of the Day,61,5,"My eight-year-old son Tristan loved to make his mom think. Most mornings, when I got out of bed, a folded sheet of paper containing his latest riddle would be waiting for me on the kitchen table. I would have three tries to guess the answer, and when the three tries were up, Tristan would burst out of his hiding place, either giggling at having outwitted Mommy or vowing to make a harder one next time.

This morning was no exception. I rolled out of bed and went into the kitchen to make breakfast. A folded piece of paper sat on the table, as usual.

I read the riddle out loud, per our custom.

“What has two legs in the morning, one in the afternoon, and four in the evening?”

I scrunched up my nose, trying to think. My sleep-addled brain wasn’t cooperating.

“This is a hard one,” I admitted. “Can I get a hint?”

I waited for my son to start laughing and say something silly, but he was unusually silent. I figured he was extra proud of this one and wanted Mommy to put in extra effort, too.

I squeezed my eyes together in concentration. Ugh, I needed coffee.

I threw out three unsuccessful guesses, answered only by impatient thumps on the wall from behind the pantry door. I sighed.

“Okay, that’s enough, young man. Come and help Mommy with breakfast,” I said. Of course, he wouldn’t actually be any help; his specialty lay in eating all the banana slices before they made their way onto the pancakes.

I frowned when I saw all the bananas were gone. The peels lay in a yellow heap at the bottom of the compost bin.

“Tristan, get out here, please.”

The pantry door squeaked on its hinges. No doubt he’d have some wildly implausible excuse: a family of orangutans came to visit, eating enough bananas makes you invisible…

It was just then that I noticed the slip of notepaper lying on the floor under the kitchen table. It must have fallen out of the folded sheet containing today’s riddle. What was this, a hint?

I bent down to retrieve it and squinted at the unfamiliar, spidery handwriting.

Wrong End Of A Gun,108,7,"Drake’s the kind of guy who thinks he’s living in a Tarantino movie. He’s also the guy who has me tied to a chair in a warehouse.

I’m not too worried though, I know something he doesn’t.

&#x200B;

I’m fucking *invincible*. That’s right, impervious. I can’t be touched.

I figured it out early on, been using it to my advantage ever since. Turns out crime does pay, especially if you don’t have to worry about being killed. 

&#x200B;

See, Drake is involved in… let’s say a rival organization. Earlier today his crew picked me up outside my favorite bar and brought me here, I guess looking to get revenge. What for? Who knows, could be anything. Seems like they were trying to send a message. But they picked the wrong messenger.

“Told you,” I chuckle. Drake’s features distort with rage. I can tell he wants to smash my teeth in, I wish he would try. Instead, he calls the rest of his crew in to dispose of the dead man and walks into his office, slamming the door behind him.

"Not With a Bang, but a Whimper",41,1,"Hardly anyone was in school today. Even most of the teachers were no-shows. Josh spent each period sitting in almost empty classrooms, staring out the window, watching the black vans wisk by. That was the only traffic he’d seen all day, those weird black vans with their tinted windows. He wondered what they were, but didn’t give it too much thought. Thinking seemed like a lot of work.

After school, he stopped at Mrs. Bailey’s place to get her grocery list. It was on his way home, so why not? He’d been delivering for some of the older neighbors since before Instacart was a thing. She wasn’t there. Judge Judy blared from the TV, a mug of lukewarm tea sat on the table next to her lift chair, and her walker was beside the front door. Josh checked the rest of the house, just to be sure, before putting down extra food and water for the cat and trudging home. He was feeling very tired.

His dad’s car was in the driveway. The driver’s door hung open. Keys dangled from the ignition. Josh thought he should take the keys and close the door, but he just didn’t have the energy.

Inside, the table was set for dinner. Tendrils of smoke drifted up from the meatloaf in the oven. His mom and sister were gone too. Josh decided to call 911, but only because he happened to be standing beside the phone. It seemed to ring forever.

“Nine-one-one, what’s your emergency?” a tired and disinterested voice finally answered.

“My family disappeared.”

“Yeah, lot of that going around,” the dispatcher said and hung up.

Josh went outside and sat on the stoop. There was too much smoke in the kitchen.

Three more black vans passed his house. A fourth turned into the driveway. Two men got out, both dressed in long black coats with broad brimmed hats. Their faces were featureless, like ovals of white noise. 

“Hollow Men,” he muttered as they crossed the yard. He wasn’t sure where that had come from. Something he’d read in his English Lit. class, maybe. Josh knew he should be terrified, but he was just too tired.

“Come with us,” one of the men said in a voice like a swarm of bees.

“Why?” Josh asked. It seemed to take every ounce of strength he had left just to utter the word.

The Hollow Men looked at each other. One shrugged imperceptibly.

“The experiment has concluded,” the other answered in his bee swarm voice. “All data has been collected. Subjects are to be placed in storage for future study.”

The Hollow Men took him by the arms and guided him towards the open cargo doors of the van. Inside was deep blackness. Josh moaned and another part of the verse came to his mind:

This is the way the world ends.
This is the way the world ends.
This is the way the world ends.

Portrait Of An Angel,14,16,"Many people have insisted that the portrait of an angel was blessed. However, it's victims have made quite the opposite claim. Yes, the initial effects of long exposure to the portrait is said to be very useful in helping Christians meet their religious goals. But over time, this initial gratification is replaced by severe suffering.

The reason that the portrait is called the 'Portrait of an Angel' should be obvious. It is rumored to be the portrait of an actual angel. But how could someone manage to paint such a thing? Well, it happened so long ago that no one truly knows. The only ‘facts’ that we have of the painting’s origin are contained in a legend.

Here’s the gist of it. The painter of the portrait was a monk. And for the first few years that he spent in his chosen monastery, he remained a devout Christian. Then, slowly, he began falling into many sinful indulgences such as gambling and hiring whores. Soon, he was kicked out of the monastery for this behavior.
 
Still, the other monks pitied him and prayed for his salvation. Many days later, their prayers were answered. An angel, the same one as in the portrait, visited the former monk in the room of an inn. After waking him, the angel took him from that room and gave him a complete tour of heaven. What he saw there made him repent immediately after the tour’s conclusion.  

Once the angel had returned him to his room, the monk immediately went to the monastery. He told them the story and pleaded for forgiveness. He also promised to remain righteous for the rest of his days. And he did. In his journals, he attributes a large part of his success to the portrait he made and kept in his room. When he gazed at the face of the angel, he saw heaven and was reminded not to sin. 
Thus ends the main ‘story’ part of the legend. But it often doesn’t end just there. Usually there is a final statement. It mentions that the ‘magic’ of the painting still works today. If one spends a long time looking at the painting, they too will learn what heaven is really like and be free of all temptation. Thus, the painting, now housed in a church in Spain, has been visited by millions of doubting Christians. And every one of them can prove its success against sin. 

At least, they can go without sin for the first few weeks or so. Then they kill themselves. From what the victims have stated before their deaths, it seems that it was not meant for living souls to see heaven. They claim that the songs of birds sound too weak. Sugar tastes far less sweet. All color and beauty looks heavily dulled. And worse, any pains or illnesses feel ten times worse than before. In general, it seems that when the portrait shows its visitors heaven, it makes Earth as bad as hell.",1620407642.0
Waiting,48,7,"Roy wasn't sure how long he had been standing there. He saw his car, the front end smashed into a wall by the side of the busy street. Red and blue lights danced over the area. He noticed police officers standing nearby, crowded around something. Peering over their shoulders, he was startled to see himself lying on the ground, receiving CPR. He patted his chest with his hands; it felt solid enough. He touched the shoulder of a police officer; his hand went right through. At his touch, the officer looked around, a slightly puzzled look on his face.

""You're new here, aren't you?"" Roy whirled around to see a young man in a bicycle riding outfit, a tire print across his torso. ""Looks like you're one of *us* now.""

Roy was still processing all this, but managed to blurt out a few words. ""What's going on? Why are we here?""

The bicyclist sighed. ""Welcome to The Wait. That's what we call it. You didn't see a tunnel of light after you died, did you?""

The words hit Roy like a ton of bricks; yes, he was really dead. ""No. I always heard there was one.""

""That's only if you're going to Heaven. Or a higher existence of some sort. No one here is really sure. But one thing we do know...we're headed to Hell.""

Roy froze. He had never really believed in an afterlife, and had lived his life accordingly. He hadn't been very nice to his wife...or his kids...or his business partners...customers...strangers...he had to admit, his had been a very selfish life. But Hell seemed excessive.

""How do we know? So there's nowhere else to go?""

The bicyclist frowned. ""From what we can tell, there are three fates. Some are granted another chance, and get born into a new body; they vanish from our sight almost as soon as they're dead. Some see the tunnel of light, and ascend to Heaven, or whatever that is. The rest of us stay here, as ghosts, until there's space for us in Hell.""

""Space?"" Roy gaped.

""Hell isn't what you think,"" the bicyclist explained. ""There's no bottomless pit, or endless torment, or any of that. Well, it hurts, but not forever. Hell is more of a spiritual incinerator. So there's fire, but that's the doomed souls being annihilated. We understand it's very painful, but the good news is, you'll be in too much pain for conscious thought. So we've got *that* going for us!"" He managed a forced laugh.

""And we just stay here, and watch other people live, until then?""

""Pretty much,"" the bicyclist shrugged. ""And it seems to be first dead, first served. I've been waiting almost thirty years.""

Flames erupted around the bicyclist as he suddenly faded away. ""Hey, it's *my* turn! See you *never*!"" The last expression on his face beamed with feral giddiness.

Roy turned to see the officers zip his body into a bag. He collapsed to the ground and cried. Why not...he had time.",1620379260.0

I Just Want To Be A Good Mother,26,3,"It started off with a simple philosophy. The Teacher made it sound so logical. 

People are born pure. Perfect. One only needs to see the eyes of a infant or to hear its laughter to know that. This truth is self-evident. Over time, we reduce that purity through our evil actions. We learn to lie as children. To manipulate others. We learn to perform grotesque acts of sex, which only serve to further propagate our evil species. 

Old people are too far gone. They've lived so long and performed so much evil that they're not worth it. But there is still a chance for the young. A chance that they can leave this world without hurting it too much. 

It was so clear. So mathematical. Of course to reduce the amount of new evils being performed every day, one only has to reduce the amount of people. 

But isn't killing in itself immoral?

Yes.

But a sacrifice must be made. Some people must perform this act of evil to reduce the amount of evil in total. As long as each person kills at least two more, they've effectively cut down the total amount of evil. Maybe more considering how long the other people would have lived. 

A sacrifice, yes. A small group of people. A small group of heroes. Heroes who are willing to sacrifice their own purity, their own goodness. All for the sake of the total goodness. 

The Total Goodness.

Philosophy. All of it. Hogwash. Theoretical. Useless. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday my son came to me. He told me with glee about how he had tricked his friend. Tricked him so cleverly into sharing his lunch at school. Tricked him when his friend would have shared willingly. 

Where does he learn these things? He didn't learn it from me. He learned it in his school, that whorehouse of evil.

Soon I'll find out he's been sneaking out at night. 

I'll learn he's been drinking.

Maybe one day he'll break a woman's heart. He'll be an ass to her and make her feel like nothing.

&#x200B;

My hands are still sweaty. This is not just philosophy, this is real. Better to have him frozen in time then to see him become a monster.  All people are monsters really. 

Now everything The Teacher said is becoming clear to me. Maybe I can be a sacrifice. Maybe I can join the small group of heroes.

I've been pacing my room for hours now. I started off pacing in my son's room, but I can't bear to look at his frozen face anymore. 

The time for thought is over now, there's more work to do. I have to talk to The Teacher again.",1620366717.0
Coming undone,830,24,"I can only watch. 

It’s too late for those caught outside. We warned them of the wind. 

It whips and it tears.

There is one that is outpacing the others as they race back to my home but no one is faster than the wind. 

The slowest is, fittingly, the first to fall. She is removed in layers. The wind carries shreds of jean and cloth in spirals before her screams start. Strips of skin and sinew tumble off her body as she tries to pull herself to her feet. But by the time she has raised herself, her joints are worn to next to nothing. They splinter and fail her as more and more is blown away in a mist that follows and catches her friends.

It sweeps into them as a horrific gust of blood and bone particle.

It isn’t the first time I’ve seen it and I have to admit that the one who made it to the door is faster than most. It’s a shame he didn’t listen.

His scratching fades away as his body is reduced to nothingness.

I will have to wash what’s left of them from the damn door.

Activated Imagination,68,12,"Imagination. Those children that have it—really have it—stand out above the rest. Their stuffed bear isn’t ‘bear,’ it’s ‘Roger’ or ‘Queen Penelope.’  Despite our best attempts to later beat it out of their little heads with standardized tests and STEM curricula, we prize it in the young.

*Is he out? Okay, great. They never make it all the way down from ten.*

We hang their paintings on the fridge and talk about ‘artistic potential.’  We stifle delighted giggles as we ask them about the opinions of their imaginary friends. 

*No, Michael. Please just untie me! I won’t tell anyone I swear! Cross my heart! Please!*

But what about the kids who seem, well, dull? The ones who draw with only one color of crayon and when asked, always say the same thing? ‘It’s a doggy.’ Just like all the rest. 

*Okay, nurse, scalpel. Making my first cut at the tummy.*

We wanted to give those kids a chance to shine. To access that creative well we knew was always there, but that some children just couldn’t uncover. 

*No—no! Ow! Stop it Michael! Please!*

So we developed a drug, *Imagyn*. A solution to a problem we thought needed fixing.

*Can I get suction? We need to get rid of some of this blood. Alright, Let’s keep going then. The patient said he had butterflies in his tummy, but I’m not seeing them yet.*

Michael Braddock had tied his best friend Brandon to a children’s play table after bludgeoning him with a rock from his mother’s garden. As Brandon began to rouse from unconsciousness, Michael cut into his abdomen with a pair of his mother’s sewing scissors. He was not the first, just the first that was caught on a nanny cam. 

*I don’t—don’t—Brandon? Mommy! N-no—no, Doctor Braddock, focus.  I think—I think I’ve found some of the butterflies. Cutting deeper.*

The others had developed a sort of dissociative psychopathy, but had been deemed undiagnosable. They were too young. The DSM-5 was not equipped to categorize the pathology behind playtime executions or vivisections.

*Do we have a pulse? Dang it. I think we lost him.*

Michael and his mother often watched a dramatized medical procedural before bedtime. She told us she wanted him to be a surgeon one day, but for now, she just wanted him to play like the other kids, to turn cardboard boxes into spaceships, to be more imaginative. We just wanted to give kids like Michael a chance to shine. 

*Oh my god! Michael! What did you—Brandon! Brandon, sweetie, wake up. Michael, get mommy a cloth! Oh god.  Brandon!*

Abnormal violent dissociation in three percent of cases, but officially there’s just the one. Michael Braddock. Five years old. Subject 43 in the Imagyn trials. His mother wanted him to be a surgeon one day. She probably never imagined it would happen so soon.

Excerpt from the Journal of a Hunter,7,5," 
""A conversation with a vampire is like panning for gold... with the old ones, at least. Through the years, they acquire so much knowledge, such power, and in my experience, it inevitably drives them insane. It's usually a quiet sort of madness, admittedly, but... delusions about themselves, and their place in the natural order guide their every action.""

""Occasionally, there's the glimmer of some ageless wisdom, some piece of a grand puzzle they've held in their minds, out of the churning muck of time... but it's rare. Lies and deceit flow out of them like water, they think nothing of it... they're the least of their evils.""

 
""They see themselves as separate from humans, MORE than human. They have to, to justify their feeding. That's the real mark of a vampire; It's a state of mind, as (illegible) anything else... a philosophy. The ones who (illegible) made that choice yet, they're just infected. They don't know what's in store for them yet... poor bastards.""

 
""I've seen infected parents throw themselves off bridges, and in front of buses, once they find out what's wrong with them. It's bad enough to figure out why they've been feeling so shitty when they get so desperately hungry that they eat that cat that stops to rub against their leg in the street, or a pigeon that's just a bit too slow... though I think they know, once they've done that, that if they get home, and they're just a little too thirsty... well... right then, a kid just looks like a bigger, slower sack of blood.""


""Compassionate vampires don't last."" (Underlined)

 
""The ones who do... they're the worst, or with time, they become it. Killing thinking beings is routine. It means nothing, or worse, they enjoy it. They tell themselves they're 'evolving'... the strength, speed, and influence over people all speak to that impression. They're usually narcissistic, as well, and it makes them feel they deserve the gifts. The reality is, all that power, that lust for control, the viciousness, waiting to be unleashed... they've just been made more themselves. The worst parts of humanity.""

 
""Manipulating, deceiving, seducing, terrifying, hunting, killing... these are the tools they use for survival, but they're more than that. The old ones... the best ones... do it to keep calm. Practice. Even if they’ve amassed enough wealth to buy the Red Cross, they'll still go out, to keep their ""teeth pointed"". That's what they say. It means they're in control, no matter how many torches and pitchforks there are... they take pride in that.""

 
""When they've just had a cup of the blood from some hitch-hiker they picked up and drained, cut up, and then dropped off in a landfill... or when they're back on a high rooftop, licking their lips after finishing off some tired clubber in a park, who never heard them coming... they feel safe. They feel predatory, mighty... untouchable.

the shadows,14,2,"the shadows like the empty spaces

when no one is home, no one to cross their path and blur them from existence

they like the nights, when homes are silent and empty, when they can move freely, shift across the flickering lights of a sleeping home and live like the before

before, before the humans came and stole their world, when they were the only beings and the nights were their own, before the unnatural lights of the humans came to be and suddenly the shadows homes were torn away

they were said to be scary, the children who’d cry and weep about a shadow moving across their bedroom in the night. the shadows you’d see across the street when you’d walk at night, something telling you to walk faster. 

perhaps the humans were right to fear these ancient things, something deep in their brain screaming dark equals danger. and it was this that made the humans bring more light into their world. once dark forests turned to bustling roads, candles lit throughout the nights, the lighthouses set to watch over the ocean

the humans fed off light, the light they found their safety in, the very light that the shadows spent eons hiding from, now hiding in the spaces the humans feared

when the humans were out during the day, the shadows would find the darker corners of their homes to move freely, and when the humans would arrive for the evening, the shadows would be pushed back into their small spaces, the damp basements and the hall closets

the shadows did not want violence, they only wanted their homes. to live and dance in the darkness where their safety lay. the darkness that hid them from prying eyes, the darkness that hid them from those who would hurt them. they found peace in the dark homes of humans who spent the hours of daylight away, the homes that would be dark and silent when the moon was out. 

the shadows were peaceful then, knowing when their freedoms would come, knowing that the humans would soon leave for hours and hours, and their freedom to roam the homes would be granted once more

but the humans have been home for much longer now, the sickness outside forcing them into the places the shadows once roamed, the shadows losing their homes, their freedoms, becoming weaker and weaker.

A Tale from the Hmong,16,3,"    Long ago, in the jungles of Laos, there was a young woman named Gao. She lived with her parents in the village. One day, Gao went to fetch some water from a nearby stream. She carried a hard bamboo tube over her shoulder. As she trekked away from the village and deeper into the jungle, she heard a crunch-crunch-crunch sound behind her. As if someone or something was following her from behind. 

    Crunch-crunch-crunch . . .

    However, Gao didn’t remember anyone following her. Previously, she’d said she’d return soon to her parents and said hello to friends and neighbors. After all, gathering water was a daily chore Gao had done since childhood. 
    Maybe . . .

    “Hello?” she said. “Is anyone there?”

    No answer came. 

   The Hmong believed if you hear someone calling your name but you can’t see them anywhere, don’t answer it. That’ll invite evil spirits into your house.

    Anyway, Gao moved on and soon found the gushing stream. She settled on the bank and filled the bamboo tube with water.

    


    Gao eventually returned to the village. She came upon her hut – thatched roof, wooden walls, dirt floor. Inside her mother was cooking. 

    “Daughter,” the mother said. “Where is the water?”

    “I have it right here, mother.” Gao showed her the bamboo tube, water-filled.

    “Good. Now come help me cook. Your father went out hunting. He’ll come home soon.”

    


    Gao’s father returned home. Gao welcomed her father as she always did. Her father carried wild fowl over his shoulder. As the daughter took the game away to prepare the process, she made a funny face. She didn’t know if the stink came from the kills or her father. It was a rather strong odor. However, she said nothing out of respect. First, she brought some water for him, as he looked thirsty.

    “Thank . . .you . . . Daughter,” he said, with a hint of a growl in his words. 

    Gao thought his words sounded strange, struggling to say each word. Yet she said nothing because she assumed he was tired and thirsty.

 


    Supper was white rice, cooked vegetables, and boiled wild chicken. Suppers were normal. Unlike all the other suppers, this one was strange, different. Gao observed her father. He ate little rice and despite her mother’s insistence, he ate a lot of the meat – more than he’d have.

 


    While sleeping, Gao heard a crunch-crunch-crunch sound. This time, it sounded as if bones were breaking. 

    Quickly the young woman woke to see her father chewing flesh in light of a small fire. Only it wasn’t her father. It was what. The human skin lay rotten . . . The smell . . . The eyes glowed yellow. 

    “Tsov!” Gao gasped. “Tiger!” She grabbed a bowl of hot pepper and climbed into the loft. The tiger chased her. But Gao threw pepper in its eyes and escaped. The other villagers came to her rescue. Before anything, the tiger was gone. Gao wept.

They’Ve Come To Take All Your Rights,3,15,"I watched with the rest of the crowd as the people were beheaded one by one.

“They deserve it.” I thought to myself, but deep down, I knew they didn’t.

Three weeks later, an armored truck drove into town. This was nothing new, this was just the triweekly purge.


I saw armed solders get out of the truck.

They kicked down the door to my house, tackling me to the ground, putting zip ties on me, shoving me into a truck with other zip tied people in it as well, and driving us to the one of the many holding camps across the US.

I shouldn’t have made that finger gun to my friend. I should’ve remembered the thousands of cameras watching every corner of the US, every house.


There were others at the holding camp, but I barely saw them, before four of us were grouped and put in a large cage. I saw many other cages, each with four people in them.




Eventually, after a few months, during which I saw other groups taken from their cages to go somewhere we all knew, a solder entered our cage, put zip ties on us, and shoved us in a truck. We eventually arrived, a few soldiers were guarding the place, a man with a sword was waiting, there was also a commander there waiting to give the signal. We were escorted up to a block, lined up horizontally, me last in the line, and put on our knees. An audience was below us.  The commander nodded to the swordsman.

The Bride's Eyes,57,7,"The Bride sat on the cold floor, sobbing. 

The cool glow of the night illuminated her dress, catching the shine of the jewels. 

Some of the troubled guests were gathered outside, whispering about how cruel the groom was. How dare he, just run off like that? 

The blue and red police lights made The Bride's mother stand out from the trees she was standing next to, her guide dog asleep at her feet, shadowy figures of ropes dangling down from branches. 

Her blood was splattered on her black dress. 

The Bride's sister would claim she knew all along that it wouldn't work out. 

""The groom never had a solid answer on anything regarding the wedding,"" one guest told another, pulling her shawl tighter around her body.

He hated the cake, was repulsed by the dress, and shunned the wedding traditions of The Bride's family. 

Some guests would later tell the police that they knew something was off about him when he refused to gouge out his heart with the ritual knife, instead using it to assault The Bride's mother, who tried to restrain him. 

He refused to switch eyes with The Bride, his Bride and didn't even cut off her pinkie and throw it in the lake. 

The group of gossipers all shuddered, and one particularly emotional one shed a few tears. 

The Bride's sister joined in the conversation, informing them all that the groom ran off before the couple would be hung from a tree. 

The Bride's sister shook her head and muttered something about how The Bride had spent years nurturing the tree, waiting for the day when she and her husband would be hung, before emerging in their new forms. 

Some of the troubled guests removed their eyes to wipe them of any tears that had started to fall, others fiddled with their walking sticks. 

The Bride sat on the cold floor, sobbing, as she was the only one in her family with eyes that could see. ",1620315340.0
PainKiller,1988,162,"The ritual is simple. Painless. That’s kind of a joke right there. Not the ha-ha kind, but more of a forced-smile-and-a-nod-of-appreciation kind. They call me the PainKiller. I take away your pain - for a modest fee of course. I don’t do it for the money.

I’ll lay you down on my couch, a cheap three-seater with a weird, swedish name, *BlömenFlügen* or some such. I’ll ask you to bury your head in the pillows, and you’ll look at me like I’m gonna smother you. Don’t worry; I’m not. Just can’t have your eyes on me is all.

I’ll light some incense, yak-musk or maybe a hint of moist frog sweat or something. Honestly I don’t even read the packages anymore. It’s all an act; a way to get you to trust me. 

My grandmother was norwegian, so when you’re all nice and comfortable, I’ll start babbling incoherently in her mother-tongue.

“Ånder, Skrømt og Vetter; la all smerte forsvinne heretter.”

I’ll keep reciting the line, over and over, until I can hear you sleeping. While not required for the ritual, it’s a preferred state of consciousness. Means I don’t have to worry about you peeking.

I can treat all sorts of pain. Even mental. It’s not a cure per se. If you’re dying, you’ll still be dying when you leave this place. I’ll just treat the symptom; that most heinous part of human existence. You don’t deserve the pain. That ceaseless, insufferable throbbing sensation, wave after wave eating away at your sanity, until one day you’re no longer human. 

It doesn’t take long. Maybe five minutes. There’ll be a creaking sound, and if you wake up I’ll tell you to take a deep breath and relax, and ignore everything around you. You’ll feel my hand on your back. It’ll be cold as death, and it *will* leave a mark. You will gasp in shock, but soon find yourself unable to move.

*Part of the ritual*, I’ll whisper. *Try to relax.*

Next up a flood of memories will rush over you. They’ll feel strangely familiar, but you’ll come to realise...they’re not yours. One by one they will take away your pain, fragment by fragment, like removing a single needle from a cactus, until - finally - you’re all needle-free. 

Pain free.

You will hear a creaking sound, and suddenly you can move again. And you will thank me. Praise me. Cry a little maybe. Write me a check. Transfer some cash. Shower me in dough.

And you will leave.

I will make sure you are gone before I open the hidden trapdoor again. I can’t help myself. I *have* to see him. See him writhing in agony, the mark on his back pulsating with searing pain. When he’s had enough, when his systems shut down, or he rots away, I will find a new one. Abuser. Destroyer. Human filth.

They call me the PainKiller, but that’s not entirely accurate. I don’t *kill* the pain.

I simply pass it to someone else.",1620241104.0
downpast where the divermin dont see,7,0,"what im telling you is my recollection but as is in my power to know it is true being based on the memories of myself and swell as he told it to me before he grew into the sky. theres parts i promised i wouldanot say and willnot but the else is truth as sure as theres fishes in the deep.

when i beknown him swell was ten nonebright maybe but plenty curious and always looking where others neverwould.

thats how he found the deep.

swimming down when the other boys rounded on him too much was swells way of prayer like otherfolk go to church.

he told me it was quiet and peaceful down there.

the way you got there was to dive and keep going once you got to the bottom you kept going anyway and in the deep there was fishes all swimming round and as swell knew them he recognized in them people he knew. the fishes and peoples were the same you could say even that they were in different places.

the night prissy kims dau disappeared swell was in the deep and he knew her fish disappeared so he knew she died.

one day after the police talked their skill to swell and because he was nonebright he told the police what hed seen and that got the police on their suspicions so they asked him a lot of questions then they went to the lake and dove to where swell said the deep was but all they got to was the bottom and went no more.

no matter what swell said they did not believe that the deep was downpast where the divermin dont see.

the police tried to put their rings on swell but he got away into the lake into the deep where it was quiet and peaceful where he knew the fishes of the police and in anger took they fishes in his hands.

when he come back up he threw they fishes down all squirming and opening closing their mouths so did the police fall down and die and disappear.

then he cooked the fishes and ate them and slept because he was tired.

when people came with worry in the morning they found him by the lake but he had grown a pound for every pound of they whose they fish he ate.

they were scared of swell after.

whenever anyone would make a fuss he would dive into the deep and eat their fishes and grow biggerstill until one day he was too big for the lake and could not fit into the deep.

thats when he stood and grew into the sky.

couldanot anyone talk to him after that because his head was too high and even when they chopped him with axes to flesh chunks did his head stay up.

its there forever now like a second moon doing playthings with tides warning and revealing quiet and peaceful deeps for us all.",1620345419.0
Magnolia,76,5," 

I think of you often, though when the magnolia blooms your presence becomes inescapable. 

Just like our time together, they grace the world with their beauty for such a brief season. You were the only woman I have ever loved. I have tried to find that feeling, that spark again, but it seems only you can light the candle of my heart. 

It’s a pity I thought the only way to yours would begin with a scalpel.

You could have tried to reason, you could have screamed for help. Most of them do. But you simply acknowledged the fate you were dealt. Bound to the tree, ankles and wrists behind you, I can sill picture the way your eyes stared into mine when I made the incision. Your ruby essence spilled from you, onto the roots, onto the earth. It gushed onto my hands and face, and you still never made a sound the deeper the blade went. 

The light in your eyes began to fade, yet you found the strength to say one last word, the one that will echo in my mind for the rest of my existence.

*“Why?”*

Since that day every other tree, all of the other vegetation, has slowly withered and died. Only the magnolia remains, still as vibrant as ever. 

I dread the day when its pearly petals begin to wilt. They seep with your blood, dripping onto the accursed ground below. One by one, they fall to the earth, the white petals now stained a dark crimson. 

Then the whispers begin, penetrating deep within my mind. Inescapable, constant, maddening. 

*“Why? Why?”* 

And then I see you once more. A white dress now blackened by gore, the skin beneath crudely stitched back together in my forlorn attempt to repair what I have destroyed. Scalpel in hand, your eyes consumed by darkness now, you will be there wherever I turn. I know you will always find me, either here or in the depths of Hell. I cannot escape, I cannot rest, until the last petal falls.

Scars cover my skin, a single word carved into my flesh hundreds of times over, still begging an answer to your question, an answer I could never give to you:

*Why?*",1620293127.0
Porcine,23,2,"Rows of garbage bags lined the small walkway as it overflows out of the dumpster. Nearby, Several men who were lost to society are jabbing sticks and fingers into heaps of trash hoping to find something of worth.

I followed the stranger to a rusty entrance. The man knocked some sort of Morse code against the door. It slightly opened up and the bulging whites of someone's eyes are glaring back at us. The stranger said two words: Type O.

A rail-thin, sickly-looking doorman bowed and gestured for us to go further in. It was dark and humid inside. Echoes of guttural screams, moaning, and shouting can be heard through each passing door. Some more violent and visceral than others. The stench was unbearable.

One of the doors burst open and out came a naked wild-eyed woman. She charged right into me and we both tumbled to the ground.

""Are you the muted prince, sworn to secrecy, come to save us all, my lord?."" The stranger grabbed the bewildered woman by her curly locks and dragged her painfully back up on her feet. He threw her against the wall, wrapped his big massive left hand against her throat, and lifted her off her feet.

He then shoved her back into the room. Inside was a skinless man laughing, dancing, and gleefully blowing bubbles. She quickly ran to a corner and cowered up.

*""They are now less than human. You shall treat them accordingly as discarded waste.""*

*""Sir, I was contacted by your agency to write an article about ""Hobo's breach."" but this is...""*

*""Permission granted. You are free to explore.""* He interrupted.

We came to an end, the path splits right and left. ""Pick a path."" He said.

I peered to the right first and then to the left. It was a long dimly lit hallway that faded into darkness. Muffled cries of anguish can be heard.

I chose the right because it was quieter but no less unnerving. I used my hands to guide me along the wall. Everything was pitch black save for the outlines of lights beaming out of cracks and crevices from a door at the end of the hallway. The floor was sticky and thick with a glob-like substance. Each step felt like I was walking on melted concrete. At last, I've reached the door.

My trembling hands slowly gripping the doorknob for a twist.

Inside was the bellowing cries of a motherless child. Behind it sat a mange humanoid creature. Its inky black beady eyes burning its gaze right through me. It began to assume a defensive posture.

The man disabled it with a tranquilizer shot as soon as it lunged at us.

*""That is the father of the child. It is prone to vomiting up blood on a 12-hour cycle, we have to result in using blood transfusion to keep it alive.""*

*""And the blood type is?.""* I asked.

Here in the Dark,19,2,"Wake up. Cold.

Open your eyes. Dark.

Here in the dark, there are no stars. Here in the dark, there is only the icy embrace of emptiness and the looming shadows you can’t see.

Must be careful of the monsters. Always hiding here, in the dark. Watching, waiting. Waiting for you to fall asleep again. Waiting to sink their teeth into your flesh, tear your muscles and snap your bones, drink your warmth. Waiting to gouge out your eyes with their claws, leave you a shredded, bloody mess. Wanting to make you suffer.

But there aren’t any monsters, are there? You imagine the monsters so you have something real to fear, so you can pretend you aren’t alone, so you can pretend that something cares about you, even if it only cares about your flesh.

The only thing worse than having monsters under the bed is having nothing at all. The real terror isn’t the fangs of the monsters. It’s waking up, again and again, realizing you're still alive, still here. In the dark.

God, you wish for the monsters. You wish for their torture, wish you could feel something besides this horrible hole of meaninglessness, this vacancy of being. 

There aren’t any monsters. There is only ever you.

Sit here in the dark.
Wait for the rescuer who won’t ever come.

Close your eyes.

Cold.
Dark.
Nothing.

The Arch in the Garden,13,2,"When I was a child, my grandmother had a beautiful garden. In the middle was a white marble arch, with vines intertwined amidst its surface, with blossoms and blooms across the vines. I was fascinated by this arch... in my mind I would imagine if I were to walk through it, I might be transported to some other place; but I was a bit squeamish to such an adventure. What would be on the other side?

One day, I decided I would play into my superstition, to prove to myself once and for all that I was just being silly. I stepped out to the middle of the garden, and bowed my head as I went under the arch; it seemed bigger from the distance I would usually view it. I poked my head out rhe other side and... nothing changed. Not noticably at least. I went back to the patio to check my grandmother and, to my surprise, no one was home. I was alone.

""Where could they have gone?"" I thought to myself. They were having coffee out there before I went to investigate the arch. ""Maybe they went inside,"" I figured. I tried to open the door to the inside of the house, but it was locked. I peeked in through the screen door and... to my bewilderment, the house was entirely empty. No furniture, no people. Nothing.

At this point I had confirmed what I most feared: the arch does appear to be some sort of gateway. I rushed back to the garden to see something I hadn't noticed; the flowers were all wilted and rotting, as if they hadn't been watered in years. I went to the arch, took a deep breath, and went back the way I came. It was not as small this time. After passing through, I felt cold air on my face and hands. I looked around, and everything around me looked rotten and moldy. The arch was still a pale, shining white.

I had to accept my fate. There was nowhere I could go, nothing I could do, but rot with the world. I begged, pleaded with anyone, anything that could hear me, shouting and crying to go home... but I was home. This was home.",1620320769.0
Black Comedy,23,2,"You wake up to a perfectly normal morning. The sun, bright and cheerful through the windows; the sky a bright blue, without a single raincloud in sight.

You get out of bed. Something sharp pierces your foot. Pinpricks of blood fall on the floor. It feels like your foot is on fire. Your eyes water with the pain.

Looking down, you find a carpet of nails, stretching as far as the eye can see. They are arranged neatly in rows, with the pointed side facing up. They sink into your feet like little teeth, refusing to let go.

Invisible laughter tinkles through the air, cruel, mocking, at every nail you step on, for every drop of blood.

So you fight through the pain and the nails, tears streaming down your face. When you get to the kitchen, your stomach growling, you open the fridge. Empty.

The cabinet. Empty.

You dial for takeaway. No response.

Here comes the laughter again, as if on cue, twisting through your ears. Your blood boils.

“SHUT UP!” you yell, hands over your ears. The laughter does not stop.

Then you slip and fall--right onto the bed of nails. Soon you look like a human porcupine, with all those nails sticking out from you at various angles, with blood pooling around them and dripping on the floor. You look quite a sight, actually, haha.

You’re as entertaining as clowns in the circus. It is no wonder the laughter comes, savoring every moment.

Desperately you take a knife and cut off your ears. They clatter on the floor, and blood gushes out in a thick torrent, cascading on the floor.

Is it really necessary though?

We all are here, you know, enjoying the show. We all are here as you struggle, with the laughter forever tearing through your brain and echoing around your head.

This is the best show of our lives. If you look up, you might just find the cameras and the speakers. Yes, I put the nails on the floor and took away the food. And I did just that because you are a very boring person and I wanted to make your life more...**interesting.**

And we are all laughing now, me and my friends. Isn’t it all worth it? :P",1620303305.0
What a Trooper,38,7,"He had droopy eyes, one more so than another, but they both drooped. The sagging skin around them bulged and looked like they were the only thing stopping them from dropping out and hanging by their ocular nerves. His bent posture made me imagine those two orbs bouncing and swinging as he spoke. I wished there was some string which trailed from his tailbone that I could pull to make him sit up straight and set his eyes back in his head, but there was no such thing and, indeed, most of this was just my imagination anyway. He spoke softly and the cigarette hung loosely from his lips which almost never seemed to really touch. He droned in a monotonous, garbled way when speaking.

“Whaawereyouthanigh?” the old, Georgian trooper asked. Last night’s vodka sweat itself through his forehead and soaked his clothing. I wondered when he’d last changed them. It was more than just the stale alcohol. I could also smell the thick, meaty musk of his balls. It was like the old man had no underwear on and they’d been rubbing directly against his brown, polyester suit.

“Excuse me?” I asked politely.

He enunciated each word, which only accentuated his lack of percussive consonants. It drove me bonkers. “Whaa…weerree…you…thaaaa….nigh….?”

“Which nigh...T?” That tee was so sharp it could have punctured a balloon.

His expression dropped in disbelief, if you could imagine it. His brown eyes must have been clutching onto his eyelids for dear life. He just sat there staring at me before a little smoke finally caused him to rub them. He crushed the butt into the overflowing ashtray. He coughed into his hand and then smeared it on his pants. I stared at the reflecting snail trail.

“When Imogene was kill…?” he finally asked breaking the silence. He sniffled, rubbed his bulbous, red nose and coughed again.

I looked down at my hands, sighed and then rubbed my face. “I told you. I was with my wife. We had a nice dinner, had a few drinks then went to bed.” I was tiring of this.

“Bullshiii! She wasn’ there!” he exclaimed.

I looked around the room. On the desk in the corner was a picture of him and Imogene when they were younger. They seemed happy. I wondered what their life had been like together. I wondered if he would have done anything for his wife. I’m pretty sure he would have… or at least he seemed so at the moment. He was a trooper, through and through.

Fixing him a drink of vodka, antidepressants and anti-coagulants as I had been each night since his wife’s murder, I walked over to where he sat powerless in his recliner. I poured the mixture down his throat, then sat back in front of him and watched. When he started stroking out again, I dropped the vodka bottle in his lap and left.

After all, I am definitely the type of man who will do anything for his wife.",1620286348.0
Re-Enactment Of A Murder,8,2,"Every night, the ghost of my wife visits the bedroom. She appears at 9:44 pm and disappears at 9:48 pm. And while she is there, she re-enacts her murder. 

First, I see her lying down on the bed. The position of her arms and hands suggests that she was looking at her phone. For half a minute, she remains in this position. 

Then she starts. She then slowly turns her eyes towards the window. Her mouth opens into a screaming shape, but I don't hear the scream. She rolls off the bed and tries to make it to the door. 

She never makes it. An invisible force grabs her by the hair and forces her to the ground. She tries to struggle as impressions form on her body. The attacker is climbing on top of her!

Then, with one quick movement, the attacker snaps her neck. The impressions fade as the attacker gets up and leaves. I am left with an image of her lying dead on the floor just before she vanishes. 

I watch this every night that it happens. Sure, I could leave my bedroom at this time so that I don't have to see it. But I don't. 

I want to watch. I want to atone for what I did. I wasn’t there for her when she needed it most. I’m not a bad person, I swear it! I swear it!

Yes, she had begged and pleaded with me; told me to not go back to the office. There was someone or something wandering around outside the house. She had heard and seen it. 

And, yes, I didn't believe her; told her that she was just being hysterical. Then I went back to the office anyway. And it was in my absence that that person, creature, or whatever it was broke into the house and killed her.

But, know this! I have tried every method I could to find her killer. I have called the police and even did my own detective work. Any other methods that I have used have been dangerous or ridiculous or both. 

Still, I have continued to do this, even though the cost of these methods have added up. Even though I have spent my entire life savings, I continue. Now I am cutting deeply into my monthly salary. But still I am continuing to search! 

People are telling me to stop, but I I know that I must capture this murderer. I have to right my wrong! I have to avenge her! I am a good person, I swear it! I’m the best man and husband in the world! Nobody can say otherwise! 

That is why, until I catch him, I am continuing to watch! I know that it motivates me to try harder because it hurts. It hurts to feel the guilt and despair again and again and again. In fact, it hurts so much that I fear I may be losing my sanity. But I must continue!",1620315817.0
Destitution,11,1,"Everyone is familiar with the feeling of just being too exhausted to bring over an item they need, be it their cellphone they left outside or a sandwich, so they kindly ask a family member to lend them a hand But some people abuse this form of human kindness. People like my mother

She was a rather conscientious woman, who spent more years of her life studying than not studying. But all that determination faded into oblivion once she entered our apartment. She always made me do her bidding. There's no problem with asking for someone's help once or twice

But asking for someone's help no less than twenty times a day is bit of a stretch, I think.  And the most annoying part was, she'd call me over for the most senseless reasons. She was sitting on her bed, and would know I'm sitting on my bed then ask for me to shut her window. The window that was approximately three feet from her but longer ways away from me. 

The amount of housework she made me do was exhilarating, and if I didn't do everything, just the way she intended me to, I would get shamed. She would tell me I was ungrateful, evil, useless, even called me slurs sometimes

I was just playing games on my phone, hearing the heavy rain hitting my window, as if it were to break it. Sometimes my room flashed gleaming white as thunder lit up the dusky blue sky. Then I heard her voice. 

""Could you please wash the tub for me? ""

I sighed- there she was, at it again. I left my room, entered the bathroom and began scrubbing the bathtub's inside with a colorful sponge. I was finished with the task and just when I returned and sat back on my bed, she exclaimed for me to take out the trash

I got back up and headed to grab the trash bags. I left the apartment and ran to the dumpster as fast as I could, but I got soaked anyway. I tried to enter my room again, when a low pitched voice called
 
""Bring me some ham, would you? ""

I got up once again and headed to my mother's room,with that type of ham she always loved. 

Her urn was on her bedside table. I swear I didn't mean to kill her! But when she was yelling at me a few years ago, and even telling me to take my life,everything went dark, and when I saw again, she was on the floor and the porcelain bowl in my hand was broken, next to her. Luckily for me,the policemen thought it was an intruder, though I don't know why

It wasn't my conscience that made me help her. I was obligated. If I was to refuse her wishes, horrible things would happen. I only refused once and it ended in a tragedy. I do her bidding out of fear of what she would do next time",1620313463.0

Nothing beats warming up your body and getting into the rhythm. My feet pound the pavement to the beat of the latest shuffled song.

Peacefulness. Tranquility. Serenity interrupted only by the trees rustling. My mind is still but for the structured melody in my head.

The sun yawns and begins to slowly flood the path before me with light. The rays are faint, probably because of the clouds, but the trees, houses, and bushes stand at attention in our friendly neighborhood.

And the birds... wait... where are the birds... 

I hear a faint pop as I pluck my earbuds out, and stand there in silence. 

No, no chirping, no singing, am I too early? Not even the flapping of wings... No, wait. 

I look up at the clouds and see them for the flocks of birds they really are. The beating of their wings that I have mistaken for the rustles of the trees.

A Starving Share,122,9,"My momma never feeds me no more. She used to, but now she’s so focused on moving forward, she’s just about forgotten anything else. ‘The medicine to cure,’ she keeps saying. ‘When we get to Dover Station, they’ll have it. They have to. That’s where all the doctors’s gone.’

I don’t know anything about no medicine, but when the food ran out at the last town, we had to move. Momma seemed scared and I ain’t seen her like that since the day the world went out. A part of me was scared too on account of momma, but a bigger part just wanted a warm meal. A trifling comfort. It’s just been so long. 

“Momma, when are we gonna find food again?”  My voice sounded like a growl to me, my rumbling stomach playing tricks. 

“Oh, angel, I know, I know. We’re almost aways to Dover, now. They’ll see you fixed up, you’ll see.”

My momma loves me.  Fat times or slim, she’d never let me starve. She even tried to feed us some when we left Duskdown, but I reckoned them old value mart cans had gone foul. I couldn’t stomach it without feeling sick, but momma ate some to stay strong for the both of us. 

I just wish we’d stop. Just for a while. Momma’s got food, I know it. But she’s keeping it to herself just in case she gets hurt and I gotta go it alone. I love my momma. I hope she’s right about Dover—doctors and all. If there’s doctors and other folks about, there’s food. 

We had to put the brakes on before a clearing come. Momma whispered “stay back, angel. There’s a man up there. We need to be quiet as a church mouse, hear?”

Momma said all men wandering the road alone was dangerous. 

This one was no different. He came on all bluster and violence, pointing a Winchester rifle like the kind daddy had before the cities was damned and the graves was empty. 

“Move out of the way or you both die!” He hollered. His hand shook. More fear than hate. He had food. He was afraid we’d take it. 

I looked to momma after the first shot went wide. The rifle clicked with the second. 

“Go on, baby,” she said, taking the muzzle off my face. He did have food. I savored every bite from scream to silence. Around 170 pounds, bones and all, but I only took a starving share. 

When I was good and fed, I told momma thank you, that I loved her, that together we’d never starve, but she just looked scared again, like she was listening to the wind for the next monster to cross our path.

"For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He seeth all his goings",16,3,"  

Calvin, of course, could have used a tool more apt for the job like a hatchet but he felt a pious quality about the chisel. He worked the steel edge into the top of his remaining big toe completing the ring of ragged flesh. He wiped away sweat and was pleased with his progress. Just bone left now. He ground his teeth into the sodden rag in his mouth then began to strike the chisel.

*Quietly*…*Quietly!*

The last quarter inch or so of bone didn’t want to cut. Irked, he rose from the floor lifting his foot up onto his coffee table with the nettlesome toe jutting out over the edge and glanced around for a suitably heavy object. He settled on a large tome from the bookshelf, aimed, and was rewarded with a crack as the book snapped his toe off.

*Breathe!*

He sat down on the floor again and held the stump in the lively blue propylene torch flame.  Calvin rested a few minutes, gathered up his tools and unwadded and folded the rag from his mouth. Grunting, he fished under the couch. His search successful, he plopped his toe into the empty flower pot on the table.

Calvin’s mind wandered...but, no…Best not to think about them now. The Eyes of Dog couldn’t produce tears anyway. And even if they could, likely only an officer was watching now. Even if the families were watching, Calvin wouldn’t want them to mistake the source of his would-be tears. He blinked instead. He sighed and got to what remained of his feet, keeping most of his weight on the right foot – well, “foot.” He had already worked his way up to his thigh on that side - only prosthetics remained.

*Enough*. *I’ll mop in the morning.* He hobbled to bed, if not to sleep.

At daybreak, Calvin shifted out of bed. Knowing he’d best use the crutches, he grabbed them and made his way to the kitchen to put coffee on. He balanced precariously to mop up the coagulating blood in the living room. He picked the flower pot off the coffee table and brought it into the kitchen  and sipped his coffee.

Sentenced to the Eyes of Dog – a plea bargain granted. They were necessary. His further actions were not. He *chose* to show them he was not what he was. Show them that he was capable yet of proffering good unto the world. He finished his coffee and took his potted toe out into the greenhouse. He covered it with soil, placed a seed, and buried it.

Calvin filled a watering can and limped among the shelves. A glorious multitude of petals and leaves brushed his sleeves as he watered. Blazing sunflowers towered to the glass roof. Burning blue forget me nots shivered as the watering can passed over them. Red geranium blooms dripped about the lower shelves. He blinked.",1620281003.0
My once in a lifetime experience,46,5,"My parents dragged me along to the square even though I had repeatedly told them that there was no point in me going. They kept telling me that it was in a once in a lifetime experience.

I kept pointing out to them that I was completely deaf so wouldn't be able to hear anything but my mother promised she would translate everything for me.

I stood in the stifling heat and kept getting shoved about by people as they tried to get closer to the stage.  My father offered to place me his shoulders but I declined as I was almost a teenager now.

There was a change in the atmosphere in the crowd, and I glanced up onto the stage to see a bunch of high ranking clergy on stage. As they began speaking I glanced over to my mother but she was too entranced with what they were saying to translate.

I glanced over my shoulder and could see dozens of TV crews who were broadcasting this across the globe to an expected audience of over a billion.

There was a blinding light from the front of the stage and I spun around to see the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. The clergymen looked confused for a second but quickly composed themselves and stepped aside.

The woman walked up to the microphone and glanced around at the hushed crowd that was awaiting her first words. I felt her eyes linger on me for a second and felt a weird sense of dread for some reason.

She finally opened her mouth and began to speak. It was at this moment that I felt a splatter of rain fall on my face and quickly wiped it off with my sleeve. A wave of confusion crossed my face as my sleeve was now all red.

I looked up at my mom and was horrified to see that blood was pouring from her nose and eyes but she had a weird look of contentment across her face. My father slowly slid to his knees with blood pouring out of all his orifices.

I turned around to ask for help but was met by a sea of blood smeared smiling faces. I stood there in shock as one by one they slowly collapsed to the floor. I felt a tap on my shoulder and slowly turned around.

The woman stood there with a pleasant smile on her face and gave me a hug before turning around and disappearing.

I stood in the square surrounded by smiling corpses and finally understood why God never tried to communicate with us.",1620253712.0
Locks,125,4,"My family had a strange tradition. One day in the year, my family would leave the house and lock every door and window from the outside. 

Clearly, when we’re going out, we’re going to lock the front door from the outside, right? Except, it wasn’t just the front door. With the exception of the basement, every door would be locked against the centre of the house, with old timey lock and catch. This meant going into all outermost rooms, locking yourself in, then exiting a door or *window* and locking that.

Another part of this bizarre ritual, everyone would have to lock themselves inside their own bedrooms. We would exit through the window and then climb down a ladder if we were upstairs, my parents helping the little ones, which was always a thrill. My dad would lock up the front and back doors, and then we’d leave.

For the kids, it was like a vacation. We’d stay at a hotel for the night or schedule a vacation for that period. But as I grew up, it always felt like our parents were distracting us, keep our mind off the wrongness of the situation. It felt too *urgent* when we left. 

And I always felt something was off about the house when we came back. As if our space had been violated. The basement door was never locked but upon our arrival always left wide open.

One time, I broke a rule and learned why we close the doors. I left my bedroom door open.

It had been an accident. I was so caught up in the event, it slipped my mind. Afterwards, I thought if I could slip back inside and lock it, no one would know. 

That’s why I went back at night and saw what I saw.

That night, my house became twisted and warped to me. All the locks on the outside had a new meaning. They weren't just for keeping people *out* of the house.

The night I learned what lived in the house when we were gone. What came out of the basement. What we were keeping *inside* the house. 

While we were gone, something else had moved into the house.

Even before I saw “it”, I felt it watching me from inside the house. I felt as it watched me from my own bedroom window.

My own face was inside the darkened bedroom, looking out at me. 

The thing inside held a lamp to show me it’s smiling face. It was completely naked. In the place of my eyes, two black pits looked out the glass pane into the woods at me. 

The naked thing beckoned with a finger.

*Let me out*

I don't know what's inside the house. All I know is that it can never get out.",1620231377.0

Rock Star Hair,341,13,"My Father, once an energetic lead singer and guitarist for a rock band, had been cut loose when the alcohol abuse kicked in. After going through a divorce with my Mother, his days were spent watching the tube with a six pack within reach. He may have been soulless and inebriated most of the time, but I still cared for him, so I stayed at his place a few times a month to keep him company.

One night that we were watching TV together, an informercial grabbed his attention. A man in a cheap suit was on stage talking into a microphone as a fake-looking, almost animatronic-like band of guitarists and a drummer were swaying back and forth, playing music behind him.

“Do you miss your rock star hair? Do you want to impress the girl of your dreams? We can help! A seed a day keeps the hair from turning gray. But wait, there’s more! Has the top of your head been feeling a little bare lately? Our seeds are guaranteed to grow out those golden luscious locks. Just call the number on the screen to place your order!”

My Father was dialing the number before I could finish laughing. 

“Dad, I know you hate being bald, but do you really believe this shit? It’s a scam,” I said, hoping he wasn’t really buying into this nonsense.

“Jeremy, I have to win her back. I miss your Mom,” he responded.

“You know she didn’t leave you because you lost your hair, right?”

“Maybe this will help me get better, build my confidence.”  

A packet of seeds arrived the next morning. My Father popped them open and downed the bag.

“How long does it take until it works?” I asked him.

“It says on the package to expect results within a day,” he replied.

Around two in the morning, something tickling my face woke me up. I opened my eyes and froze when I saw that the room had been filled from floor to ceiling with a golden bristle-like object. Every inch of space around me, wavy, tingling hairs. 

“Jeremy, help me,” my Father’s voice murmured.

I trudged through the hair, gagging as locks tried to nestle their way into my mouth. It felt like it took an hour to maneuver my way from the bedroom to the living room. And then I saw his face amongst the sea of hair.  It reminded me of what chewed gum looks like when you pull it apart with your fingers. My Father wailed while the thousands of hairs around him stretched his face and removed it from the bone beneath.

The room of hair shrank down to the size of a tumbleweed and rolled out the front door. I was at a loss for words. A skeleton was all that remained of my Father. Weeks later, I stumbled upon that infomercial. And behind the main in the suit, I recognized the guitarist. He had my Father’s face.",1620207483.0

It's always a bad time and no matter what time or day it is, it's always a bad time for me. So Craig whenever you bring over a cake to my house a couple of days a week and asking me whether I could try it inside my house, and always hoping it's not a bad time, it's always a bad time Craig. Because when I got my dog halfway changing into a human of mixed gender, and then the half changing dog starts ripping it's own organs out, you bet my life on it Craig it's a bad time to bring over a cake to my house to taste test it. It's always a bad time to bring over any cake to my house.

Jaron whenever you knock on my house asking me if it's a bad time for me to go on a jog with you, to be honest Jaron it's always a bad time for me to go on a jog with you no matter the time and day. I hate that it's always a bad time for me to go on a jog with you but when I've got another dead person in my garage, that kind of comes first Jaron. To deal with another dead person after another dead person in my own bleeding garage and that absorbs a lot of my time Jaron, so I don't ever have a good time to jog.

Darren whenever you come to my house asking me whether it's a good time for me to go on a hunting trip with you, to he honest Darren it's never a good time for me to go on a hunting trip with you. It will never be a good time for me to do anything with you. The reason being is when I'm dealing with a woman's screaming voice that has come out of her mouth, and I'm running around everywhere trying to catch this woman's scream inside my house it takes all of my time.

Cracking Open Skulls Is Kinda Fun,6,2,"I knocked on our door only to be pulled in swiftly by my aunt who shushed me and took me inside my room and sat me down. My aunt tells me, 'They'- implying my neighbours, are out on a prowl knocking on every door, demanding to be let in so they can take away any child or teen below the age of 18. We stood there for a while and then 'They' came- loud banging on the door shook me but I went and looked through the peephole. I saw 3 men, i recognised only one; oddly enough, he was one of my professors from college, old and balding.They knocked, demanding to be let in but my aunt refused. I went inside and looked for the best weapon I could find- a heavy steel cleaver we'd always used to chop meat. As I was sharpening it, I heard a thud as they'd broken down the door. One of them rushed in to the kitchen while two of them held my aunt down. I am only 17, I was no match for the 6 foot tall assailant and so i knew the only way I could subdue him is to hit hard. I had one chance. I raised my arm as high as it could go, turned the blade around to its blunt edge and cracked his skull open with one swift motion; it bled. I vividly heard the sound, reminiscent of the cracking of a ripened coconut and found it oddly satisfying. I felt a rush of adrenaline as I charged towards the two in the drawing room.After they ran away, I propped the door up. I held it up against the frame since the hinges were broken. I switched off the lights and kept my handy cleaver near my foot; rebuffing myself for my naivete in sharpening the blade when you'd quite clearly use the blunt edge to cause damage. I clang to the walls to push the door firmly into place; knowing very well that they will return and that cracking open skulls is, ig, kinda fun.",1620269881.0

I walked towards the large piles of white and brown. As I got closer I realized what they were. There were billions of them. They all had different title written in different languages. The covers varied from intricate to plain with different shades of leathery brown for each.  I couldn’t read most of the titles and the ones I could I hadn’t heard of, “Jolanie Maritoni Partegga. Lukas Matingly Johansson. What’s with these titles?” Then I found a title a recognized.  Except it wasn’t a book that I recognized it from, it was my mother’s name.

The figurine,21,1,"Smooth, cool and black. He moulded the figurine out of a dark clay, buffing its angles to a sheen.

It needed to be flawless. Not a dimple, not an irregularity.

He turned it around on the wheel. Each angle, each facet was regular. He tried with a mirror and it was perfect. Not like the human face, which will give you two different people if you mirror each side.

He was ready.

He closed his eyes, muttered the incantations. Sprinkled the powder.

Breathed...

...a long, hot breath.

But his wizard's sleeve caught the jar of tools and they fell, scattered, a heavy scraper falling against the figured and slashing and crushing its front.

Just as the hot breath infused it. 

And it stirred. It looked up at him through its one-and-half eyes. Its mouth permanently dragged down into a leer where the falling scraper had tugged the still soft clay.

""Masssstteerrr?""

Even the voice was broken. Crooked. And now fixed forever: a twisted thing. Malevolent.

It should have been perfect. A thing of grace. A thing to serve him, pure and obedient.

""Masssstteerrr?""

""Daddy's gone somewhere, sweetie.""
""I want to wait for Daddy,"" the little girl said. ""Mommy, I want to wait for Daddy.""
Her mom frowned. ""Are you sure?"" 
""Yes.""

***

Lisa fell asleep and was eventually taken to her bedroom with her new doll in tow. Then, after a while, it happened. Again. Loud words. Loud noises. At least that's what Lisa could understand. Every night since one day, it seemed Mommy and Daddy had a big fit about something, a fit that even the police couldn't stop since they were an hour away -- of which trees and land spread for miles, where they lived.
""Jerry, you can't take her--""
""You're a dumb b$$$!""
""I was wrong to be with Joey--"" 
""I knew that he f#-ed you last Saturday!"" 
A crashing sound was heard. Lisa squeezed her doll tighter and hid under the covers.
""I'm sorry!"" 
Another crash.
A scream.
""Mommy!"" Quickly, Lisa jumped out of bed. She screamed for Mommy. The little girl carrying her doll was coming to her mom. She climbed down the stairs and entered the kitchen. She smelled Daddy's bottles and saw the smashed cake on the wall.
""Mommy!""
Daddy took a look at his little girl. Mommy was crying. Her head was bleeding.
Lisa stood frozen, scared. Was this Daddy? The sweet, kind man who'd make her laugh and spoil her with Kid's Meals? No. Daddy was different tonight. Angry, messy-looking. He even walked funny; he reached for his little girl. But said little girl hugged her doll and screamed the loudest ever she could've mustered.

 Morning came and the birds sang their songs. Lisa woke up and grabbed her doll. Lisa was in her bedroom again. There was blood on the floors and on the stairs. 
""Mommy?"" she asked at the top of the stairs. 
Mommy didn't answer.
Slowly Lisa descended the stairs and asked again. 
No answer. Just that she saw more blood, in the hallway leading into the kitchen. She hugged her doll as if her life depended on it. 
The floor creaked until she reached there. 
The kitchen floor was soft and red beneath her bare feet.
Mommy and Daddy were still there, lying together with big paper cuts on their faces, with their eyes gouged out with pencils.

Static,70,8,"It was shapeless, like static come to life, and it followed me around everywhere I went. It'd drift out of my sight, and eventually my mind. But it always came back.

It didn't have a name, I've asked it countless times. It just laughs each time, giving me a slightly varied deadpan response;

""I'm all the parts of you that you hate."" It hissed, floating around my head like a huge mosquito. ""And the best part is, I'm here for the rest of your life."" Although it had no face, the grin it revealed shook me to my core.

It started getting worse about a year ago. I'd see a large field, flush with plants and bugs, before the static rushed over it, revealing dirty needles and leftover trash. I'd listen to my favorite song, then the static would crawl in my ear, and I'd only hear high pitched ringing. I'd treat myself to my favorite meal, only for the static to bite into it, turning my fresh chinese food into rotten sludge. My friends would be playing video games online with me, before the static would sneak into the television, making every small pixel feel dull and lifeless. 

Everywhere I went, I brought the static with me. Sometimes I'd break down, yelling at the static to just leave, but it would only laugh.

""I'm here for the rest of your life."" It enjoyed reminding me.

I tried other methods. Got really into drinking, deep into some scary drugs, but nothing seemed to take. Even if I got a brief respite, the static always came back, sometimes even worse than before.

""You can't push me away forever,"" It would smirk. ""I'm along for life.""

That got me thinking, and I reached a decision. The cuts down my arm are painting the carpet red. I got the radial artery on both arms, it's only a matter of time. 

As I expected, the static appeared one last time. This time, I got to grin at it instead. ""If you're along for life, you better make it quick."" I laughed like a madman. I found a way to outsmart the static; it couldn't haunt me for life if that life ended early.

The static looked puzzled, before vibrating and grinning maniacally. ""That didn't take long."" I realized the vibrations were laughter. ""I hope the next person is more of a challenge."" With that, the static dissipated. 

Without it in my vision, my apartment looked nice, the sun was shining, I swear even the sound I heard had color. For the first time in a long time, I wasn't afraid about living the rest of my life.

I started feeling cold, so I wrapped my arms around myself, shocked at the sticky warm blood on my chest. 

""Oh. Right."" Reality set in, and I realised that the static got exactly what it had wanted.

In my head,42,11,"*It’s all in my head.*

*These aren’t people anymore.* 

*There’s no guilt to be felt.* 

*Escape is the only option.*

These mantras keep me going through all the ruin and debris. With every gunshot, every missile, there’s an accompanying scream in the distance. It sounds so haunting, so hapless…so helplessly juvenile.  

For a minute, I am reminded of my own darling Bella. Her timid blue eyes, her bleeding arm…and her anguished screams of despair as I shot her in the heart. 

It almost brings tears to my eyes. *Almost*. 

But I can’t let guilt overpower me. Guilt should be felt for people. These aren’t people anymore.

*It’s just in my head!*

So I keep running, fighting; shooting, sawing through the massive hordes of undead in my way. It’s not easy- there’s too much devastation to ignore. Every gut-wrenching scream that pierces through the air. Every sharp bit of shrapnel that bruises past the skin. 

Seeing every last remaining member of the family fighting the inevitable decision. 

Just like I did…with my used-to-be wife. Her screams pleading me to run as far as I could…right while I watched an undead sink his bloodied teeth through her delicate skin….

But this is no time to lament the past. It’s about protecting the future that’s left. 

I have to stay strong. 

I have to fight this conflict in my head. 

So I fight, and I run, and I don’t stop…through all the bombs, gunshots, destruction. Paying no heed to the crying, the fighting, the bloodshed going on around me. Killing every single undead that comes in my way. I keep fighting…ignoring…running…

Until there’s nowhere left to run anymore. 

My back is pressed against the wall. A horde of undead is approaching, ready to pounce on my flesh. I shoot grenades, bullets, machetes…through this unstopping crowd of dead-eyed people. People, who once used to be my friends. 

My family. 

No, I can’t show weakness. Guilt, yearning, and regret…none of this matters.

*It’s all in my head!*

*I have to fight it!*

Except I can’t fight anymore. The undead…these weapons…these contrasting feelings in my head…

I can’t.

The moment I lay my gun down, violence becomes silence. Bella and my wife limp their way through the gathering of zombies. For the longest time, they remain standing at their spots. Thinking, observing me, blood dripping from their mouths. 

Giving me time to rethink my decision. 

In my head.

But I don’t want to think anymore. It’s too painful.

“Please,” I croak. “I can’t deal with the emotions in my head. Do it.”

No sooner than I say it, I feel countless fangs pierce my head. My skull gets ripped into shreds. I collapse on a bloodied chunk of my own brains.

Right before I lose control, I feel a pang of regret. 

But as I rise, rejoining my family as a newly-turned zombie…I feel a lot more relieved. 

No more brains. No tough decisions to make.

No conflict in my head whatsoever. 

Just plain, bloody destruction.",1620192559.0
A few words.,16,7,"The letter pinched between my finger and thumb flapped in the ocean breeze.

The envelope’s only imperfection, a bloodstain of a thumbprint at the seal, has held my attention for the last hour. But another strong gust threatens to push me off balance and send me to the rocks below.

I regain my balance on wobbly legs and hold the letter up to my face asking it, “What gives you the right?”

I must’ve read it’s contents hundreds of times. The message is simple, actually just three words. It was left at my doorstep with no name, no context and no return address. Maybe another person would’ve pitched the paper and forgot the whole damned ordeal but I just can’t.

“Why me? Why did you have to come?” I fear I already knew the answer to that question. I am afraid whoever wrote this me is right about me.

“What did I do to you? What did I do wrong?”

I hold the letter up again. If I can just let it go the wind would take it and no one would ever have to know. Maybe the thoughts would go away. 

But I can’t let go.

Ben entered the Greyhound with a hat pulled low over his forehead, eyes down, and a bandaged hand. *Blood seeping through*. He made his way to the back and found an empty spot beside a dark-skinned brunette.

“Taken?”

“No, please,” she said.

He sat.

He noticed the girl had slid a large case into the space in front of her and put her feet on it, giving her the peculiar appearance of a perched bird. When she noticed Ben looking, she—

“Please, it’s fine,” he said.

Just then, a NYC cop got on the bus.

Ben held his breath.

The cop looked the bus up and down a few times before saying, “Listen, folks. If any of you sees somethin’ suspicious, you tell the driver. OK?”

The cop got off the bus, the engine roared and the bus pulled away.

Ben watched out the window.

He thought that the girl was cute but nervous. He tried several times to talk to her, even flirt a little, but she wasn’t cooperative. After a while she started softly singing to herself and checking her phone.

Her face looked illuminous in the sunlight.

“You alright?” Ben asked.

“Yes, fine.”

That was it. A friendly winky face. She paused for a moment, puzzled over the strange message sent from an unknown number, then decided to text back:

*Who are you??*

Without missing a beat, a message was swiftly typed back and sent.

Liza furrowed her eyebrows and pursed her lips, considering the message. Whoever was doing this had to be playing some sort of prank or just trolling around.

*Is this some kind of joke?* she typed before hitting send.

Deciding not to entertain whoever sent the messages, Liza switched off her phone, slid out of bed, and promptly strolled to shower, planning to continue her day unbothered.

The winky face seemed to smile mockingly. Liza had to flicker her eyes over it multiple times to make sure she wasn’t hallucinating. Hurrying over to her car, she slammed the door shut and sped away as far as she could from her home. 

Her day at work was less than productive, considering she checked her inbox at regular intervals to make sure the culprit hadn’t sent any more messages, though thankfully none popped up. By the time it was time to knock-off from work, she didn’t return home, instead driving over to a trusted friend’s place to stay for the night, hoping it'd make her feel safe.

She strolled over, and noticed that the window was slightly ajar, so she slid it down. As she fully closed it, something came into view. Blanching white with shock, Liza inched her face closer to ogle what was scribbled with a finger into the frosted glass of the window.

We have booked an appointment for 12pm, but when we come, it is darker than midnight inside. A halo of light comes floating towards us, accompanied by an angelic, musical voice. A dainty hand snakes out and grabs my father by the arm, leaving the rest of us to trail after him.

There’s no menu—too dark to read one anyway— but the hostess says food will be here soon. I ask why it is so dark.

“Oh,” she replies casually. “We want everyone to enjoy the food here. People these days are always looking at their phone. They cannot enjoy their food properly, yes?”

I must admit, she has a point.

\*\*\*

Something clatters in front of us a few minutes later. Food is here. My stomach grumbles like a monster that hasn’t been fed. It is time.

I pick up the food. It feels long and stringy. Spaghetti. Lovely. I love pasta.

The spaghetti strand squirms. It hisses.

Spaghetti isn’t supposed to do that, right?

Right?

I suck it up and bite down. First comes the sweetness of the sauce, made of ripe sweet tomatoes and sweet basil. Mm.

Then something cold, hard, bitter, metallic.

*What the\_\_*

I choke, spitting it out, hearing it land splat on to my food. But the next thing I know, my plate starts hissing.

It slithers up my arm, crawls on my face. *Hiss hiss hiss*. Some even get into my mouth and cuddles around my tongue, between my teeth. I feel them sliding smoothly into my eye sockets and down my throat.

Then all of a sudden I feel my body jerk forward and I lie down on my floor and start to crawl forward without using my limbs.

*They got in my brain. Oh— hiss. Hiss hiss hiss.*",1620200702.0
Meet Dave,21,7,"They had been friends as long as Robin could remember. Everyday he would get home from school and Dave would be at home waiting for him. They were best friends, or so Dave told him. They would sit on the carpet in Robin’s room and Dave would laugh and giggle as any child would while watching Robin push around his little toy cars. Often, Robin would try and introduce Dave to his mother but of course his mother was unable to see “Dave”. He was imaginary, but as long as it made Robin happy that’s all that mattered.


Robin would often draw pictures of him and Dave, and his mother was beyond amazed at the extent of the description and detail her 9 year old portrayed his. The picture depicted a child, roughly the same age. Blue eyes and the darkest black hair possible to be drawn with a child’s crayon. Every picture Robin drew, there was a jagged red crayon streak across the eye of Dave. Upon inquisition, Robin explained Dave told him that’s where his dad had hit him with the hammer he had been using while fixing the car in their garage. Perplexing, but probably nothing more than the over excited and stimulated mind of a generation raised by television. 


Dave was always there for bedtime with Robin. But strangely enough, he didn’t quite look the same once the lights had been shut off. He scared Robin, and Robin implored of his mother to leave a night light on for him. He would sit with his knees to his chest in the corner of the room and smile at Robin as he closed his eyes and drifted to sleep. Robin would always fall asleep with a smile on his face, knowing his best friend was there looking out for. That night the light turned off while Robin slept. 


Robin’s mum felt a tug at the edge of her blanket. Groggy from sleep she rolled over to see what it was that had summoned her son to her domain so late at night. The white-ish moonlight that cast a glow through the pale curtains that covered her room illuminated the figure of not that of her son. The first thing she noticed was the deep red gash above the child’s eye. The rotten teeth and pitch black eyes petrified her beyond her senses. She could smell the scent of death the earth had provided him with. The yellow skin hung loosely and in flaps around his face, exposing chipped skull and bits of brain that had somehow remained over the course of time. He smiled. The seemingly innocent smile of a child. But there were no teeth to bring any sort of appeal to the face. All that came forth from the mouth was a putrid liquid that poured out as water does from a faucet. She was too taken aback to make even the softest of sounds. 
“Hi, I’m Dave. You must be Robin’s mommy”.",1620177599.0
Popular,30,3,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve wanted to be popular. Not *famous*, just popular. I was always a little chubby, a little awkward, a little nearsighted, you know, a little—me. I saw the dismissive looks when I asked if I could hang out and I heard the fumbling excuses. “Too busy.”  “Too...whatever.”  I just didn’t want to feel alone...disregarded. 

From the virtual forum of my third floor studio apartment, I tried to find the connection I wanted through a webcam and a keyboard. I had 42 followers; around the population of my apartment building. They weren’t *all* pervs. It was something. 

Sat. 10:13am: *Hey guys! Wrote another song. Really proud of this one, though my ukulele skills could use some improvement. Anyway, let me know if you wanna chat about it! Link below.*

Sat. 11:09am: *29 likes in under an hour! Thanks guys! Maybe I’m better at ukulele than I thought...or maybe there just aren’t any new kitten videos this morning. Anyhoo, DM to chat!!*

Sat. 12:58pm: *Just came back after lunch and...wow. 1,923 likes!! That’s a record by a long shot. I read some comments. SO glad you liked it!*

Sat. 2:14pm: *okay, first off, 82k likes and 43k shares...is this going viral? Also, I’ve had to block a few users. Some of the comments are getting pretty weird.*

Sat.  3:07pm: *2.2M likes...whoa. Also, if you’re not trying to talk about the song, please stop DMing me.  A lot of these have been really personal and kind of...well...creepy. Everyone else, muah!*

Sat. 3:49pm: *Somebody fucking doxxed me?!  NOT COOL. And before you call or text my phone, my memory’s full. I turned it off. 74M likes. Is this real?*

I watched the likes and comments climb.  Someone had made a bot to periodically re-dox me in the comments. 

The mods responded with the same creepy personal questions the users had. ‘Could they have me?’  ‘Did I lock my door?’  ‘In which of my organs did I store my creativity?’ ‘Heart?’ ‘Liver?’ ‘Spleen?’ Eventually, the website went down temporarily due to an “Automated DDOS Attack Protocol.”

When my doorbell began to buzz and I heard the voices droning from the street, I fled to the safety of Marjorie, a sweet, technologically illiterate octogenarian down the hall. When she answered the door, she held me tightly as I cried. 

“It’s okay. I’ve got you.” She assured. “I’ve got you. All to myself.”  At first I hadn’t noticed the laptop on her dining table. A gift from her son, no doubt. 

She snapped at me as I pulled away, yellowing teeth gnashing, eyes, fixed in frantic determination. She grasped at me even as I slammed the door. Again and again, until the obsession was still. 

Now, I’m alone. The crowd below undulates like floodwater between the buildings. I can hear them in the hall. They’re screaming for me. 

I’m *too* popular.  Too scared.  Too…whatever.",1620168205.0
5 Minute Walk,1410,59,"I’m outside mom’s house, bare feet planted firmly on searing hot pavement. The sky is a greasy shade of penguin beak yellow. It’s strange you know, I’ve never really considered how the sky *should* look. Just took it for granted I guess.

Five minutes. How long has it been? Can’t remember leaving the house. Only have five minutes though, better make the most of it. 

*...the right thing to do ma’am.*

Oh, I didn’t see you there. Sometimes, um, sometimes my mind just blanks on faces, removes them entirely. I was born with parts of my brain all loosey-goosey. Said, um, the doctors said if you shook me as a baby, you could hear them squishing against each other up there, you know, in the brain juice. Um, you shouldn’t shake a baby though.

*...painless?* 

That’s Bobby over there, um, with the scissors. Always hated me. Called me *Fred, Fred Half-a-Head*, even though my name is Jonah. His sister, um, Josephine is the one without the eye. I kinda like her. Not sure what happened to her eye though. Something to do with the scissors I bet.

*...no registered activity for months going on a year.*

So I’m only allowed outside for five minutes, um, because I keep forgetting where I am, and since I don’t do faces so well, I always walk into people, and some take offense to that. Say, could you read this note for me? I don’t read so well. The words kinda freak me out, makes me remember things that never happened.

BLANK

That’s right, I was going out for BLANK. I do that, you know. Help around the house, buy, um, groceries and stuff, and I almost never get lost then. You ever seen that movie, Memento? I have, but I can’t remember it. Was it any good?

*...is it over?*

Say, you look familiar, but I can’t place you. You have a friendly face though, like one you could see yourself touching, um, feeling all the pores and indents, you know.

*...won’t be long now.*

Um, the sky is bleeding now, you see that? I don’t, uh, I don’t think it’s supposed to do that. I better get going, only have five minutes, and it’s my favorite part of the day, the outside. It’s the only part of my life, the outside.

Say, um, you’re kinda melting over there. I can see your innards through your outards. I don’t think that’s healthy. Just look at Bobby and Josephine over there. They’re nothing but a pair of floating eyes in a pool of human waste now. Not very appetizing, um, you ask me.

Please, um, don’t go. I don’t like the voices.

*...ctor, did you see that? He moved. His eyes moved.* 

Mom?

*Reflexes. There is some activity for up to four minutes after death, but they’re just cadaveric spasms.*

No, um, I’m allowed *five* minutes. Not four.

*You did the right thing, ma’am. He can rest now.*

Please, um, there’s still a minut",1620081305.0
Rubber dinghy rapids,7,2,"
I want to see my family again who all drowned while we tried fleeing Syria off a small boat. I have found a way to see my family again and I go to Alton towers where they have a ride called rubber dinghy rapids, a water fall ride which travels around the water for a while. I save up my money from working in a shop as an illegal immigrant and when I go on this water ride, my heart starts racing as I am on the circular boat. I start having flash backs due to the PTSD and I am there again with my family. My daughter is there, my wife is there and my baby boy. Everything is good at first but when the ride gets bumpy and starts going faster, I see my family drowning. I start screaming but when I come around to reality, I observe the other people on the ride just staring at me.

Then I am back at the shop a job I am grateful for and I have food, clean water and other necessities which I didn't have back at Syria. My wife and I had no choice but to flee the terrorists and other criminal organizations were destroying everything. The war was waging and there seemed to be a never ending of it all, it's funny how we humans don't see ourselves as animals but when things become scarce we become animals so quickly. Being Human is only possible in times of peace, and so I save my money at the shop but not for retirment but to go to alton towers again and ride the rubber dhingy rapids water ride, so that I could see my family.

The last time I went on there I got banned. The reason I got banned from Alton towers is because when I went on the water ride and started to see my family again all around me, I could actually feel them. When the ride got faster I started grabbing hold of them my family, but they still went into the water. When I came back to reality I found out that I was grabbing hold of actual people on the ride and I was screaming and shouting. The security guards kicked me out and I must now find another theme park with a similar water ride so that I could see my family again.",1620187737.0
Poor Grandma,24,2,"I walked into the bedroom and there was a bang inside the wardrobe.

Slowly I opened the wardrobe door.

She was shivering, her hands held together tight.

""Hello, Grandma..."" I said.

She had a scarf over her head and she was curled up in a ball.

""They're coming,"" she told me, her voice uneasy.

""You ought to---""

""They're coming,"" she repeated hastily, ""the Nazis are coming.""

Emaciated, my dear.

""Let me get you something to eat,"" I replied. ""Something warm. Soup? It'll make you feel---""

""Shut the door!"" she snapped. Once the door was shut I heard her muffled voice through the wood, saying those words and nothing else.

*

But this wouldn't last forever.

Eventually the police came knocking on my door.

Reports of an old woman, snatched from her home. I'd been caught by a neighbour.

Well, dear, we'd had our fun, I told myself, as they handcuffed me. I had my way with you. And you lasted longer than the others.

What's Mightier than the Pen?,143,16,"“Could we go inside?” the lawyer asked.  He licked his thumb and wiped a little of the farm’s dust from his shiny, black loafers.  That was good dirt, God’s dirt, and I was glad he was taking it off his person.

“No, I don’t reckon we will,” I replied.  You should have seen his face as he looked around the yard.  I imagined he was looking for a table to put down his paperwork, but there weren’t any.  I smirked on the inside, watching him shuffle nervously.

I knew he’d be coming this morning when I got up.  The bank had been sending all kinds of letters recently.  They were talking of foreclosing.  It’s a right messed up system when all the towns and cities around you are forced to buy from the big farms out west.  They aren’t forced exactly, mind you.  Products shipped from places like Idaho, Iowa and Nebraska are so cheap that it undercuts us local farmers.  We are then forced to raise our prices due to lack of demand to try and keep the farms afloat.  And we can’t do it!  I’ve watched every farm around me dry up.  Our own farm has been here for six generations.  Multiply that with every farm that’s gone under and I bet you’d be looking at maybe a thousand years of combined work on this land.  A thousand years of serving our local folk gone.

“Where do you suggest we sit to have you sign?”  His sniveling tone dug deeper than my tiller could.

“I don’t suggest we do,” I said, hands in my pockets.

Because I’d grown up on the farm, I’ve always been a physical man.  It comes with the territory.  However, I’d gone to school and enjoyed learning.  I liked reading and I fancied myself an intelligent, albeit simple, man.  One of the things that had caught my attention was in tenth grade History class.  Our teacher had put up the phrase The Pen is Mightier than the Sword and had us dig into our books to find historical examples of this.  I thought this was a pretty neat lesson to get us thinking about compromise vs war.  I’d tried compromising with the bank and I wasn’t waging any war.  I’d always done good work to provide for my family and neighbors.  It hurt me to think that the mighty pen would be brought down upon me.  Yet here we were.

I think he shit himself when I brought out the .38.  He put up his hands and briefcase, but not soon enough.  I watched the black hole open just above and to the inside of his right eye before his head snapped backwards and he dropped.

It didn’t take me long to gut, skin and break his muscles down into their groups.  It took a little time to grind the bones.

And as I fed the pigs that night I thought, *Sure pens are mightier than swords.  But some pens are mightier than others.*",1620119135.0
1096,70,11,"I look behind me, my heart begins to race faster. The dark of night drapes over me, suffocating me like a trash bag wrapped around this whole place, but maybe that's exactly where it belongs. 

My pace is so fast I’m almost jogging at this point but I can’t let them see my fear. I look behind me, my mind is moving so fast I can’t even find my way out. I start to panic. They’re after me. 

I look behind me, nothing. They told me they’re coming, I need to get out of here, I need to get home. Suddenly, I see a figure dressed in all black approaching from the other side. I make a wrong turn to avoid it and I begin to run, to hell with who sees. 

Dread washes over me, my breathing is tense and rapid, my hands heavy and drenched in sweat. I don't know where I am. I stop for a moment to catch my bearings and hopefully to find my way back, avoiding danger. But I can’t risk going back, what if they see me. 

I look behind me. My head spins as I gaze around, confused, lost, petrified. Suddenly, a Cathedral stands before me. I am drawn to it, something lies inside, perhaps the answer. What appears to be hope for a second quickly turns into terror once I stare at the cross that sits above as I begin to see double, triple, as if I was staring through 3-D glasses. But the colors begin to shift and change and I quickly find myself turning away. Objects breathe, perspectives shift, I don't feel a part of myself. I move but I do not control my actions. Sounds intensify, they distract and disturb, the noise of chatter and laughter and chanting permeate through the heavy steel doors of the church and I know I am mocked by God. 

I turn and quickly make my way back to the original path. I carefully check the corner. 

I look behind me- something is there. My heart drops, the impending sense of doom grows stronger as I realize there isn’t just one of them, but two. I turn the corner and run as fast as I can. I wonder if I can outrun them but my thinking is cut short as a vehicle rapidly approaches from behind. This is it, this is who they’ve been telling me about. 

I freeze. The vehicle races past me and makes a sharp turn onto the street in front of me. They won't get the chance, I won’t let them. 

I reach into my pocket and grab the switchblade that lies there. I press it to my throat. I hear the door next to me open and I quickly draw it across my jugular as all my pain pours from the wound and the vehicle continues moving. I hear a scream. I drop to my knees and begin to feel cold. While I can I turn to the screaming figure at the door. My body hits the pavement, I feel the life draining from my corpse quickly. I see my mother, she is terrified, crying, screaming, throwing her hands to her face in shock. She drops to her knees as well. My eyes are drawn to a number on the wall, 1096. 

My vision fades as I realize where I am, 1096 119th street.

My nightmare,75,18,"I woke up in the middle of the night, soaking in sweat. I felt distressed, and felt something was off. I reached out to turn on the light on my nightstand.

Nothing

I tried again and again, but still nothing. I climbed out of bed to try my ceiling light and flipped the switch.

Nothing. 

I started to panic. As I stood there I could hear my brother talking, playing an online video game on the other side of the wall, but I couldn't speak or leave the room. The  darkness gave me such an unsafe feeling as I felt something evil luring in it. Suddenly, I felt tired and my eyes were heavy. Then it hit me; I was dreaming. I grabbed my phone and tried texting my boyfriend for help and how I couldn't wake from my nightmare. But all I sent was gibberish. I laid back in bed and tried the light switch one more time, still nothing. I closed my eyes and desperately tried to wake up as I could feel whatever was hiding in the dark coming closer..

For My Father,57,8," I love my family.  I would do anything for them.  Especially my dad.  He’s been there for me through thick and thin.  I hated seeing him in a nursing home.  I offered to share my place, but he wanted one of his own.  I didn’t blame him.  Truth be told, he didn’t like my neighbors much anyway.

I lived in an old duplex.  Me on one side and Jimmy and his family on the other.  We shared a large yard as well.  I was doing some renovations in my kitchen and they were helping me from time to time.  Naturally, a few pieces of furniture needed to be moved when I was preparing to redo the floor.  Except one.  An old wooden hutch sitting in the corner.  That particular kitchen accessory was off limits.

 “Cursed?  There’s no such thing as a curse,” Jimmy said, rubbing his hands all over its warped and rotting wood.

 “I'm serious.  If it’s moved, someone close dies.”

 I know it sounded absurd, but it was the truth.  I explained how one of my uncles passed; a friend's grandmother, and even a family pet.

He simply shook his head and chuckled.  “It looks like firewood to me, brother.”

 I shrugged.  “Don’t believe me?  There’s only one way to find out, right?”

Jimmy was a pyromaniac.  He had always been obsessed and entranced by the sight of a large, blazing fire.  I decided to let go of the hutch.  It was falling apart, after all, and nobody wanted the damn thing anyway.  That’s why I was going to watch it burn.

It was a couple of minutes past ten when Jimmy and his two boys smashed the hutch into pieces and put it on the fire.  When it wasn’t catching fast enough, they poured gasoline to get it roaring.  The inferno was created.

 I opted to stay inside and not join in the nighttime festivities.  I turned out all of the lights and watched the party from my kitchen window.

Jimmy, his two sons, and their mother were all sitting around, carrying on.  That’s when his eldest stood up.  He wobbled, trying to keep his balance, but the alcohol wouldn’t allow it.  He took one step forward and tripped, landing right in the fire pit.

 Everyone screamed.  The fire rose higher as the boy’s flesh began to burn.  The parents pulled him onto the grass, smacking him.  The flames didn’t smother.  Instead, a loud POP sound came from the pit, shooting embers into her eyes.  She wailed in pain.  The fire took on a life of its own, spreading like lava across the yard.  One by one, the flames consumed their bodies.  Their bloodcurdling screams filling the night air and I sat alone watching an entire family be destroyed.

 Just as the lights from the fire company shone into my house, I called my dad and left him a message.  “Hey, dad.  It’s Billy.  I think I found a new place for you to live.”",1620127589.0
Broadcast,16,4,"Living on a budget is hard so I'm not able to afford any new technological wonders. Luckily, there's always one channel that comes in clear as day on the old TV from my parents. It was hardly anything worth watching, but when you're broke you're not picky. The shows that played were often erie but there was never any reruns. 

A cartoonist woman named Mother Maryanne danced around the black and white screen of fake landscape. Every once in awhile she would crab walk to the rhythm of the music. Her purple overalls and white painted face made her look like a cross between a milkmaid and a menacing mime. A strange little girl sat down happily in the background. She smiled at Mary then at the camera then back to Mary. Mary stopped the goofy waltz slowly then looked down to the kid. Their speech sounded off so i wasn't able to catch the first part of their conversation. 

""....anything if you just believe in yourself.  You just have to have a good additude and a better sacrifice."" Her tone sounded like a preacher. 

The girl giggled like it was the funniest thing in the world. Once her laughter died down she asked a question in excited voice.

""Can we have a new friend, Miss Mother Maryanne?""

Mary smiled a toothy grin and the camera panned over to a badly injured bloody man hogtied on a sheet of fake grass. He whimpered through a cloth gag in his mouth. My stomach twisted but I didn't dare turn it off. Perhaps this wasn't a kids show. 

""Yes why don't you go retrieve him, Lilith."" Mother Mary motioned for her to leave. The girl got up quickly and walked off screen. Mary watched her leave, then turned her head back to the camera. Now the terrible gaze met mine. They each glowed a deep hungry shade of scarlet this time. Before I could grab the remote, a noise at the front door interrupted me.

The Hammer,6,4,"
She had better fucking run while she still has the chance. I’ve always loved her, but she doesn’t love me back. It's time for her to suffer like I have, feel the pain I have felt. Nothing can change my mind now, i'm no longer in control, but deep down I hope she fucking runs. It's her only chance, she can’t stop me from doing what is right. She’s brought this upon herself.

I make my way down the hall to the room I know she is staying in. Slowly, I creep up to the door and crack it open, no creaks, no noise, no witnesses. She’s lying in the bed, as beautiful as always. Strawberry blonde hair, wide hips, perfect figure. I pull the door closed behind me, no creaks, no noise, no witnesses. Nothing can stop me now, not even myself.

I raise the hammer, as quickly as I do I bring it back down striking her right upon her jaw. Can’t have her screaming now can we? It is immediately smashed to bits as I see her chin flap and crumble with a satisfying crunch to accompany it. Her mandible is split in two, she looks like the goddamn Predator. It gets a chuckle out of me. She immediately wakes up, trying to scream but only managing a whimper and a gurgle. She looks me in my eyes as bright red blood pours from her face onto her elegant bed sheets. I lift the hammer and strike her once again right in the forehead. Blood shoots from both nostrils as her cranium completely caves in. I strike her once more across the temple, bits of skull and teeth and blood shoot out against the wall. I gaze upon my work. An eye popped from the socket, her face mangled and disfigured, her top lip where her bottom lip should be like a Piccasso painting in real life. She looks good like this. Really fucking good.

I finish my work and head down the stairs, hammer still in hand, right behind my back. As soon as I reach the bottom of the stairs a voice calls out to me from the table.

“Max, shake your sister awake will you. Your mother’s made a delicious Chicken Parmesan, it's to die for”

I shower in the dark,90,3,"It didn’t used to be like this.

Growing up we used to leave the lights on and had a ‘no locked door’ policy for our bathroom. My parents were deathly afraid that if I were to slip and fall they would lose precious time to get to me, but nothing ever happened. I chalked it up them being a overbearing. 

I moved to college and lived in the dorms. Communal bathrooms were now my only option and the feeling of privacy began to feel like a luxury. It was now a row of showers, toilets and sinks and everyone had something to ask.

“How are classes?”

“Where are you from?”

“What’s your major?”

“Did you hear about the murders?”

“.....The what?”

“They haven’t caught them yet. The police said it’s a new serial killer. Apparently slashes people up in their showers. The victim they found yesterday brings the number up to six...”

A few days later the campus put out an announcement to ‘stay alert’ and ‘report anything that seems off’ just standard stuff. I had enough to worry about and just pushed on. 

Despite the varying my study hours and trying to shower at different times of the day there always seemed to be just a few people always there. Tonight was no different but luckily for me the two seemed completely absorbed in their conversation to not even hear me sneak into the stall. 

Before I turned the nob for the hot water, the low and heavy thud of the heavy bathroom door closing echoed into the showers.

“Hello?” One of the other stall members called out.

I didn’t want to start my shower until I heard a response but all that came was the sound of heavy boots rounding the corner to the showers.

“Hey!? Everything okay?” For whatever reason the others didn’t turn their shower off. 

A boot fall met a puddle in a splash as the end stall was opened.

“What the he-!?.....”

The last word was gurgled.

A body hit the ground.

The other person screamed. 

I heard their stall open. 

Their noises weren’t silenced nearly as quick. 

I sat in the corner of my stall watching the blood slowly flood in.

I struggled to remain conscious as the blood met my feet.

The sound of cutting finally stopped. 

I could see the form next to the body stand lifting something. 

The steps started to leave but stopped before rounding the corner.

A thrown head lands in my stall with a crashing splash and I am drenched in the others blood.

The lights go out with a low rumbling laugh. 

I fall in the blood. I feel hair and gore as I pushed the head away. 

As I struggled to stand I turned on the hot water.

My mind snapped. I didn’t want to see the horror. I just wanted to be clean.

The Sun,963,53,"Everyone knew that the sun was disappearing. Ten years prior, the great glowing ball in the sky began fading at an alarming rate. Each year plummeted us into more darkness than before. The government had spent the years prior preparing for what would happen when the sun finally burnt out. Thousands of structures were built, filled with artificial sunlight to keep crops alive. Citizens stocked up on food, clothing, and water. Everyone was prepared. We were ready.

But nothing could prepare us for the creatures that would come up out of the caves and holes in the ground once the sun was finally gone. The vile, hideous human shaped creatures that seemed to have waited thousands of years for this exact moment. The earth no longer belonged to us.",1620039639.0
Who's a Good Boi?,385,14,"Dellany couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen a dog; not since all this zombie stuff started, anyway. As far as he knew, the undead didn’t eat animals. They were strict peopletarians; fresh, living humans only, but in all the chaos of the outbreak, most animals had made themselves scarce. Sure, there was still a squirrel or two running around the city, and plenty of birds, but it had been months since Dellany had seen a dog.

This one had light grey fur with black speckles, the color of cookies and cream. Six inches of frayed leash hung from its collar.

“Hey, there,” he whispered, crouching and holding out his hand. “Who’s a good boi?”

The dog cocked its head.

Dellany slipped off his rucksack, fishing out some jerky that he had scrounged from an abandoned gas station down the street. He tore off a piece and tossed it to the dog, who gave it a quick sniff and gobbled it down.

“Who’s a good boi, huh?”

The dog turned and trotted a few yards away, stopping to regard Dellany with ice blue eyes.

“Hey, where ya going?” he cooed, creeping slowly, so as not to spook the animal.

The dog scurried further up the sidewalk. It paused for a backwards glance, before disappearing into an alley. Dellany followed. He’d never been much of an animal lover, but these last few months had been so lonely. It would be good to have a friend.

At the far end of the alley, the dog sat, tail swishing on the pavement. Dellany approached slowly, tearing off another piece of jerky. He had gotten within ten feet of the dog, whispering soothing words and assurances, when it started barking.

“No, no, no! Don’t do that!” Dellany hissed, waving his hands.

The undead couldn’t see very well. Their eyes gummed up with dirt because they never blinked. They didn’t breathe, either, so no sense of smell, but they could hear just fine. They could hear your stomach growling with hunger from a block away. He knew that from personal experience. Dellany decided he didn’t really need a friend after all. Turning to run, he found himself face to face with a zombie.

She wrapped her rotting arms around him, sinking her dirty, broken teeth into his neck, before he could react. Dellany broke free of her embrace, stumbling backward against the wall and clapping a hand to his wound. Blood squirted between his fingers and washed down the front of his shirt in waves. She’d bitten through his carotid artery. The strength went out of legs and he slid to the ground. As she dropped down to bite into his calf, Dellany noticed the other end of the frayed leash, still looped around her decaying wrist. The dog watched her with adoring eyes.

Yes, you’re a good boi, Dellany thought, just before the world went dark. Still loyal to your human, even though she wasn’t really human anymore.",1620055193.0
Grief Counseling,91,23,"“Good evening, I’m back. I...didn’t think I’d be here this long, but a part of me is glad I am. We’ve known each other for a while now, so I think I’m ready to tell the story.

“I loved my son. He had been a sweet, funny kid growing up. He was the sort of child who became deeply immersed in this or that. A singular passion so rare in later years. When he was three, I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. A stupid question. I expected he might say ‘Pay-len-togist.’  He was in a dinosaur phase. Instead, he thought deeply and then yelled, ‘Maybe...you!’ A beautiful answer.”

*I heard the denials.*

“I loved my son.  It broke my heart to see him go to kindergarten. He was so worried they might keep him. He came home with stories about other kids, animals, shapes. ‘A stop sign has eight sides and ‘vertects.’ That’s a octagon!’”

*I heard the pleading.*

“I loved my son. In high school he struggled. Friends came and went, adolescent popularity being the mutable thing it is. He talked about music, politics, women. He was so often wrong, but I didn’t correct, I guided. He would learn in time.”

*I heard the screams.*

“I loved my son. He proposed to his fourth girlfriend after high school. She was pretty, ambitious and whip smart, but I told him he was too young to jump into a commitment like that. He corrected. He loved her. *I* would learn in time.”

*I saw the fear.*

“I loved my son.  After his third child and 10 years of marriage, I *had* learned. He and his wife would argue, but they knew where not to tread. They knew how to forgive and forget. It warmed my heart to see them. 

But at some point in my son’s story, it happened.”

*I saw him sitting there in the dingy room, tied to the chair with a hodgepodge mix of electrical cord and fraying rope. His face was bloody, a jigsaw puzzle scattered across the floor and carelessly reassembled. His shirt was red. I could see the liquid sheen through the fabric, the dozen tiny holes—a shroud concealing something worse. Tiny holes perfectly matching a flathead screwdriver.*

“You know where the truth of the story ends and where the shattered dreams of a father begin. You know because you were there. You ended it. You ended *him*.” 

*I tightened my grip around the handle of the screwdriver. His blood, sticky between my fingers. He tried to speak through the rolled up sock and the duct tape I had just used to hold it in place. Allen Ward was a maintenance worker from Poughkeepsie, no great evil, just a man.  But he killed my son. Nothing he could say would change a thing.*

You are not a failure Rory McGovern,22,1,"You are not a failure Rory Mcgovern and you will never be a failure because even though you tried to break into a house and didn’t manage to get into the house, after the event that family upgraded their house and are even more protected.

Rory Mcgovern listen to me carefully when I tell you that you are definitely not a failure and will never be a failure in my eyes, even though you feel like a failure. When you tried to do a drive by shooting at a certain person but you missed the target, do not feel bad for this. Now that target has gone out of town into a safer and well protected area and you have made him improve his life. The person you did kill accidentally because of missing your target, well that person was so incredibly suicidal who hated life and you did that person a favour. Does that sound like failure rory? No it doesn’t.  

 
Rory Mcgovern believe me when I tell you that you will never be a failure and it is impossible for you to fail in my eyes.

That is not failure that will never be failure in my eyes.  

 
Rory Mcgovern you are the opposite of failure and you are always succeeding even though you don’t know it. When you tried strangling the old man when you broke into his home, because you were strangling him and depriving him of oxygen, the little small alien creature that has been living inside of him all of his life and causing him distress had come out of him, finally giving peace.

They Blamed Video Games,190,11,"At approximately 9:33 a.m. on March 9th, 2005, Ohio senator Lewis White was attending a career day at Jean Miller Elementary School. At that time, he was focused on giving a presentation on his job as a politician to the students. He had no idea of the tragedy that was to occur. 

The disaster seems to have fallen into place all too perfectly. As 7-year-old Tommy Brooks was in the first grade, he had been sitting very close to the stage. As all the students had been rushed into the gym upon their arrival at school, he also had his backpack with him. In it was the pistol he had taken from home. 

Senator White had only been on stage for 9 seconds before Tommy pulled out his gun and shot him. The bullet landed right in the senator's jaw and exited through the senators skull. Not only did this cause White's face to be ripped apart, but it also caused a splatter of blood, skull, and brains to splash the projection screen behind him. 

All was silent for the first few seconds of the gravity of the situation sank in. Then came the chaos. Children begin screaming. Adults gasped and immediately begin rushing the children away from the scene. Some children and adults were trampled but, luckily, none were killed. And Brooks was luckily subdued by two teachers who had seen him perform his deadly deed. 

The papers were more than happy to report the story with a sensationalist headline: 7-year-old student shoots the state senator. The blame was, of course, placed on violent video games. Investigations concluded that the boy played them a lot more than most kids his age, after all. It seemed like an open and shut case. 

Then, the boy's father begin speaking out on Twitter. Tweets upon tweets piled up on top of each other. The image that it painted of the father and his son was haunting. Mr Brooks bragged about how he had essentially made his son into a killer by teaching him how to use a gun. He commended him for killing the state senator that he had told the boy he hated. 

Apparently, all that Brooks wanted to do was impress his father. ",1620055550.0
Actions Speak Louder Than Words,8,1,"I painted on the bright red lipstick on chapped pink lips and picked up the needle. I stuck it through my bottom lip. Skin is not so different from silicone you see, you just need to push a little harder to get things through. I continued to thread it through the top one, repeating the process, over and over. Through the top out the bottom. 

This was how I needed to be, actions speak louder than words they say. So actions I shall perform. My lips now gleam with something other than lipsticks and balms. I slink out of the house, my footsteps falling into a certain rhythm that makes me hum all the way. I arrive at her home, her window slips open easily. What a fool she was to keep it unlocked, does she not know psychopaths would easily be able to get in?

 I slip into her bedroom, my footfalls silent as a mouse.  I see her peacefully sleeping, covers pulled perfectly over her body. For a second, I smile and remember all the times we hung out in this bedroom *before.* I quickly wipe the smile off my face and pull out my needle and thread. “There are things you cannot fix with your sorries'' I begin. She stirs, eyelids fluttering. “Words you cannot take back, but I can fix this problem. I will make it so you never have to take anything back again…” I step closer and seize her hair. She struggles against my grip, but I win at this struggle. I pull the string through her bottom lip repeating the pattern over and over while she screams. Although she can scream no longer, she still tries.

The Incident at the Decatur Meat Processing Plant,33,6,"The room had no windows. Chapman’s hands shook. *It would be better if the room had windows*, he thought. “I’m going to need you to focus,” said the corporate investigator, his voice incongruously deep. Chapman thought he looked like someone who’d recently lost a lot of weight: slack, drooping skin. “Sure thing.”

They were here to talk about the incident at the Decatur meat processing plant.

An incident to which Chapman was the lone witness.

*All those raw bodies—*

*people still—*

*kneeling and crawling, reaching up their arms to that fucking thing in the sky...*

“Tell me again when you first saw it.”

“Had to be past midnight. I’d gone out for a smoke.”

“Anyone else outside?”

“Nah.”

“And you called your floor supervisor?”

“Uh-huh. Over the radio. I said to him, ‘Oddest thing, Joe, but there’s a cow out here in the fucking yard.’”

“When he came out, that’s when the—*transformation* started?”

“Yeah. I mean the cow looked up at me when I was making the call, but it wasn’t till Joe got there it sprouted those goddamn wings.”

*Cartilage spearing flesh—*

*weaving itself into giant filmy wings like an insect’s...*

“Did it fly?”

“More like hovered. Lifted itself off the ground and hung there in the night sky.”

*Screams—*

*from inside the plant—*

*sickening smell of spoiled blood, of decomposing guts—*

“That’s when people started running out, one after the other, some covered in slime, yelling about the animals going nuts inside. Cadavers coming back to life, stuff like that. Then seeing this floating cow and stopping dead in their tracks, dropping to their knees. Joe had a handgun and he was pointing it at the fucking thing, but he couldn’t fire. All the while this *thump-thumping* was coming from inside the plant, and the people started praying.”

“To God?”

“To the floating cow. Begging for forgiveness.”

*Bovine head beginning to spin—*

*cracking of bone—*

*a distension of the skull; a ballooning out and an elongation of the face into a goddamn flesh trumpet!*

“I guess they were all outside by now, the ones who weren’t dead. Kneeling, begging. It floated above them, casting this black shadow. There was this girl, Karen. She looked up at it and said, ‘I don’t deserve to live,’ and it extended its—”

“Proboscis,” the investigator said.

“Yeah, and just...”

Chapman didn’t want to say: didn’t want to remember.

“Tell me.”

“It sucked the skin right off her fucking body, like some kind of freak vacuum. Came off in one piece, leaving her looking like an anatomical drawing—but still fucking praying, *thanking it*—until what was left of her just fell apart, lost its shape and collapsed into a pile of steaming innards. Then it did the others the same, and I swear to God all I heard was this deep voice repeating the same three words: *delicious human nectar*.”

“Yes,” said the investigator. His voice deep, his cheeks impossibly loose. *Like a puppet made from human skin—*

Ornithophobia,43,8,"I was only 13 years old when I learned that my older sister had a terrible fear of birds. She was 16 then and at the time she had a severe aggravation to this fear. 

As I recall, Cindy (my sister) tried to spend as little time in nature as possible, she did not even like to go out into the yard or the street. Nature reserves, parks, ordinary outdoor activities could negatively affect Cindy's psyche.

In the summer I asked a question about this, to which my parents told me a story 8 years ago. They and Cindy went to South America on an excursion. At the end of the excursion, the adults took up a photo session, and Cindy played with a boy in the village. After that, the boy brought Cindy to ""pets corner"", where there were many animals. At the very edge was a harpy cage. The boy handed Cindy the killed mice and offered to feed the birds. Cindy unwittingly agreed, went into the cage and very much regretted it. The birds attacked her, scratched her whole face with their claws, tore the clothes and hair on her head, and left an irreparable trauma on my sister's psyche.

After, Cindy herself began to share her fears with me, talking about her nightmares. One day she had a nightmare where her hands were tied to a tree branch, and she herself was hanging in the air. Her ears heard an eerie, uninterrupted whistle that echoed through the nearby trees. Then she saw a large flock of black birds flying in her direction. The whistle and rustling of feathers was heard louder and louder and then the flock, overtaking Cindy, began to tear her to pieces, ruffle her hair, and peck out her eyes. Because of this noise, Cindy could not hear her own screams.

Because of this unattractive feature, Cindy was often teased at school. Classmates began to draw birds on desks, put on eagle masks and hide live or dead sparrows in Cindy's locker. 

But one day a situation occurred from which none of us could recover.

Cindy, as usual after school, sat in the classroom and waited for her parents (she tried not to ride buses). Once again, classmates decided to make fun of her. A joker named Peter brought a cockatoo cage to school. Peter opened the cage and released the bird straight into the small auditorium, while his buddies held the door to prevent Cindy from escaping. Cindy, in tears and horror, tried unsuccessfully to open the door. The bird began to fly. Cindy decided to open the window, hoping that the bird would fly away. But instead, Cindy jumped from the window herself, five stories down.

On that day, my sister passed away. My parents were depressed and could not believe what was happening. After all these events and Cindy's stories about her fears and nightmares, I myself unwittingly became a victim of ornithophobia.",1620075107.0
The Last Duty,17,5,"Braziers of great orange fires lit up the path to the temple. The preparations were nearly complete now. Already the drums beating in a rhythmic, savage anticipation of what was to come. 

*Do not fear my little child*, whispered the old woman, running a bronze comb through the wet hair of the young girl sitting in front of her. Her hands, grisled and worn with age, performed this duty with exceeding gentleness. The holiness of the occasion demanded no less.

*As we live upon the soil, so do we return to it with dutifulness.*

The girl felt a gust of wind emerge from the darkened treeline behind her and, feeling its touch against her oiled skin, trembled instinctively. She was not alone in this grand preparation; other girls her age were seated in a row beside her, being tended to by numerous women. She saw others tremble as well, and one wept loudly. Yet she herself did not weep, for it was shameful to shed tears on this day.

""I understand, old one,"" she said softly. Yet her voice sounded distant even to her, like an echo she heard once within the veiled valleys.

*You are beautiful, un'dari. The spirits are strong within you.*

Another girl, slightly older than her, carefully weaved and braided her hair. Her feet, tightly fastened with soft cloth made from the river weeds. Around her middle finger a ring tightly coiled, emblazoned with a green jade serpent. She had never worn such fine jewelry before in her life, but as she looked upon it she felt no joy. It was heavy and burdensome, and too tightly fitted. 

*Brief is our stay in this world, and forevermore shall we wander the eternal dusk.* 

The drums beat with grave exigency, as if beckoning to hasten the ceremony. The figure of a man emerged from the darkness, wearing a mask with a complacent grin. He shouted the words of old, beating the ground with his stick and stomping his feet with great vigor. The girls watched, transfixed by this godly apparition. 

*Rise now, un'dari*, *and live into what will come next.* 

In a orderly row the girls climbed the steps of the temple, and more began to weep. Upon each tenth step on either side stood masked men, wearing similar masks that portrayed the myriad states of mortal existence. Each held in their hand a long spear tipped with a brutally sharp edge, to prevent the girls from killing themselves prematurely by jumping off. 

Each entered the temple, and laid down upon hollowed stones facing the ancient kings as to be directed to them in the afterlife. 

And as she laid upon the freezing sandstone, the lid of rock was placed over her. 

Darkness.

Muffled voices. 

Prayers of desperation.

Shouts and whimpers. 

Slaps and grunts against the wall that would not budge.

And as time stretched on like the jungle rivers and clouds of the horizon,

All became quiet.",1620090605.0
Taxes,1565,38,"My old man always said there’s two things certain in life, death and taxes. He’d repeat it all the time. He’d take off his belt, fold it over, and we’d pay the ‘tax.’  He wasn’t the smartest fella on God’s green Earth, but he was bigger than my Ma and me. That was enough. He had the belt, we made the payments. 

When he put another baby in Ma, I thought he might change for a bit. And he did. For a bit. But when my brother, Caleb, was born, the taxes got steeper. When little Caleb cried too much, me and Ma’d have to cry too. 

My brother grew a little older, and he started paying. Not too much at first, but when my old man would see him flinch at a baseball, the taxes got steeper. When my old man found Caleb wearing Ma’s church shoes and a pretty scarf she had, the whole neighborhood heard him cry. And then, they didn’t hear nothing. ‘Death and taxes’, the whole thing goes. The only things certain. 

My old man was drinking buddies with the Sheriff. He didn’t even come around the house to do any policing. ‘An accident,’ he said. That’s all she wrote. 

Well, two years ago my old man had a stroke and was paralyzed from tip to toe. He’d lie in the bed insurance bought him, and me and Ma lived tax free for a change. 

A year later, the Collectors came. 

They were from some far off place beyond the stars, and plenty folks are scared of ‘em, ‘cause they take taxes too. Every year when April comes, a pound of flesh from every home. That’s all they ask. I guess most folks aren’t used to paying taxes every day. 

Me and ma paid enough to my old man, so when tax time comes, we let him pay for us. He’s bigger than us, you see, so he can pay our share. Year after year, when April comes. 

But unlike my old man, the Collectors give us something for the taxes we pay. Some fancy drugs that can keep a fella from infection even if he’s missing a foot or two of flesh here or there. I’d ask my old man if they dulled the pain, but I don’t think he woulda asked Caleb, had *he* been in that bed instead. 

I do sometimes wonder what they do with all the flesh, but then I think: best not to wonder much. Couldn’t be certain. The *only* things certain are death and taxes. That’s what my old man always said. And he’s got a lot more taxes to pay before death becomes certain.",1619991023.0

The best part of the place though, was that **everything** was edible. You could take a bite out of the wobbly jelly, or take a chunk of the wafer walls and if you were very daring, consume the chocolate mountains like an animal..

I followed him across the country as he razed the innocent to the rhythm of his sadistic desires. And I danced along, always one step behind.

I studied his methods, scrutinized the evidence, scoured the security camera footage. He was a pro. A spectre. A frustrating prize I despaired after.

I tried to reach out to him, to let him know he was on my radar, but I didn't seem to even be a blip on his. He never acknowledged my pursuit, leaving me playing a one-sided game of cat-and-mouse.

Diary of A Madman,97,10,"Dear Diary

I met a rude waiter today. He served my food cold and my table had dirt on it. He neither thanked me for my service, nor did he give me back my change. He didn't notice the look I was giving him.

After his shift, I waited for him to leave. In the alley behind the restaurant, I came to him with a hammer. I don't think he screamed when it came down. 

People don't notice much these days. Afterwards I left his body in the alleyway. On my way home, I bought flowers for my wife and some dog food. 

The roads were dark and empty near my house. The windows around here were shuttered and locked. In their bedrooms, the neighbourhood children all stayed away from the windows. They whisper bad things about me when they think I can't hear them. Especially after I took their friend last month.

When I came home, I could hear nothing in the alleys around me. The rats learned to stay quiet at night. Or at least, the quiet ones survived. Muffled sounds came from under the floorboards. The little girl is still alive underneath.

But something is wrong. Someone had been here

My dog's body was splayed out outside our wedding room, where my wife's decaying head stares out at me, surrounded by dead withering flowers. Nothing was moved.

An accident,60,5,"""Can you tell me what happened?"" The police officer asked gently, holding a notepad in his hand. He looked a little uncomfortable, empty hand fiddling with his loose sleeve, as if he had not been trained to console crying children. It was alright - I had long gotten used to controlling myself without outside help.

""I...I saw it when I was walking home."" I began, talking slowly and hiccuping as a spoke. ""I had just gone past the playground when I heard it - crying."" I stopped there, sobbing quietly as the officer patter me awkwardly.

After a few moments, I wiped away my tears and continued. ""Mommy had always told me that I should help people when they were in trouble, so I went over to see what had happened. I did the right thing, right? I think Mommy will be proud of me."" The officer nodded at that, smiling at me but saying nothing.

I took it as an invitation to continue. ""Well, when I got there I saw a bus. A big yellow one, just like my school's bus, except that this one was wedged halfway into a playground slide."" I laughed softly, not with happiness, just sheer disbelief at the absurdity of it all. "" Can you imagine that? A whole bus just stuck there, back tires spinning as they protrude from a plastic tower."" 

Then I frowned again. ""After seeing this, I went to look inside."" I looked down, letting a single tear roll down my cheek. ""There was blood...so much blood...and so many dead bodies. I got scared, so I ran away, and that's when I bumped into you."" 

Now it was the officer's turn to frown. ""But that's not what happened, was it?"" He looked at me in the eye, and spoke, a bit more seriously this time. ""Bystanders saw you running to the playground before they heard shouts, and only a few minutes later did they hear the call for help.

I smiled. ""Don't you get it, officer? I helped that boy. He was in pain, so I stopped him from being in pain, just like Mommy showed me! I did the right thing, right officer?""

He leaned in closer, and spoke very, very slowly. ""Listen to me. I want you to tell me exactly what your Mommy showed you, okay? What did you do to help him?""

I smiled even wider now. ""I took a sharp thing, then cut open his chest, and reached inside! Mommy showed it to me once - she called it 'Sergerie'."" At this the officer recoiled in horror, crawling back in fear.

Your Best Self,10,0,"The company I work for is called Your Best Self, and we do not engage in false promises.

We know that working out is hard. It’s hard to find the time, the inclination, and when you do find those things, often you’ll just go through the motions of working out. You won’t really put the mind in the muscle, where it needs to be. You’ll be thinking about the car that needs to be fixed, the laundry that needs doing, the kids that aren’t making their grades. That’s where I come in. I am *preternaturally* focused.

We’ll work out a time that works with both our schedules; I work in the early evenings, when the horizon’s just swallowed the last sip of sunlight and the smell of nature takes on a sharpness in the cool air. I specialize in cardio workouts, my favorite being the river runs many people take in the outskirts of my city. Through our patented Coach-to-Client link, I will take control of you for the duration of your paid time. My client ratings are superior and I'm available only to people of an advanced fitness level, because I go hard. I don’t come cheap. I command the highest pay bracket available on the app, $160 per 15 minute block, but I’m worth every penny. You will get your cardio.

I’ll take you for a spin around the river paths like a valet on a joyride and I’ll shave, on average, one minute and forty-five seconds off your all-time best mile. Even my advanced clientele report muscle soreness for a couple days after using my services. Most days your workout will be strenuous but uneventful, and I’ll relinquish control of you as soon as I reach the designated offlink point. I don’t run up the meter like some of the less scrupulous Coaches on the app.

Some nights, though, I’ll encounter another runner I think would provide us an extra challenge. I like to let them know early we're a threat, because we want to be tested. They may be thinking about the car, the laundry, or the kids, but when I make us known they become preternaturally focused. Your mile time may suffer a bit on these nights and your GPS tracking of our route may show a brief stop off the trail, but believe me when I say you will get your cardio.

Spiders are similar to humans. But ironically, we are afraid of them. A spider will take its time to build a web. The spider does not have a choice; if it wants to feed itself, it must make one correctly. So, the spider becomes naturally passionate about the web.
 
When a spider begins to build a web, it will start with a single thread. And once the spider uses the thread, with any luck, the free end of the thread will catch onto another branch. 

And once it feels that the thread has caught onto something, it will loop around and attach the thread to the starting point.
 
Mr. Spider sets his trap.
And tonight, I’ve set my own.
 
 In the cupboard under the sink, the black spider continues to build its web, crawling up alongside the silver pipe and around. In the spider's web is a wiggling bug, fighting for its life.
 
But also stuck to the web are other tiny white eggs. I smile, using my husbands’ knife to scrape off a dozen of the eggs. Then I mix the spider eggs underneath the mush pile of food on my husbands plate, whistling to myself.
 
My husband is a pig and devours the food quickly. When he’s done eating, he belches,-- done with me—retreating to his armchair to watch the game.
 
Well, ...I’m done with him. Let's see another week go by. Two. Three? How ever long it takes for a couple hundred eggs too hatch. 
 
I’m happy to make him whatever he likes.",1620013703.0
My Boy Is A Good Boy,133,6,"My Boy is a good boy. He does well in school, he works hard and I'm very proud of him.


After school he walks home from the bus stop. Many kids walk home from that bus stop. Kids from all grades, kids from different schools. Kids who aren't my boy. Kids who could be bad. Kids who could be dangerous. Not like my Boy.


The Police told me that Chelsea Burton was one of those kids. She was in 4th Grade and walked home from the same bus stop that my Boy did. 
My Boy probably saw her, but I don't believe he ever talked to her. My Boy is a good boy. He wouldn't hurt anyone. He would never, ever hurt anyone.


I'm sure there's a reason then, why I found Chelsea Burton in my basement. I could smell the corpse in the crawlspace under the stairs. I'm sure there's a logical reason why she ended up there… I'm sure…
But I knew how it looked. I knew what people would say about my Boy… People might ask questions. They might think he was bad! He's not bad! My Boy is a good boy! He's a good boy…


The Police are asking about another child now. A third grader, named Daniel Canfield. I have never seen him before. But I think that soon I will.
I told the Police I'd tell them if I saw or heard anything. I'm sorry that I had to lie…

But my Boy is a Good Boy.

The screams of agony from the basement don't mean that he isn't. The body I'll find in the crawlspace doesn't mean that my Boy is bad! It doesn't…

My Boy is a good boy… He's a good boy.

He is, isn't he?",1620018964.0
Danny,135,5,"Danny was my boy, my one and only son. I raised him the best I could, I let him play with baby dolls, and make up, even if it went against my own upbringing, I wanted that boy to be happy. 

And he was for awhile. 

Then it all started to sink. He'd come home from his momma's with bruises and cut's, sometimes even a burn. So I confronted her on it, which she threw me into a screaming match, telling me how she'd blame me for it, if I said a word, and get him taken away from me. 

I really wanted to believe she couldn't do us that way, but I had to fight to get primary custody. 

I didn't want to risk getting myself into more trouble.

Then all of a sudden 'Poppy' showed up. He told me he met them near a creek, some kind of imaginary friend, one that he seemed content to find comfort in at his Momma's. If I couldn't be there, I was glad he had someone, even if they weren't real.

The problem *really* started when he turned twelve. He was at his momma's house when it happened, that cynical bitch blew her own brains out. 

I just wished she had waited until my son was gone. I was sure it upset him, even if he never shed a tear. He told me in confidence he knew it was going to happen, because his friend 'Poppy' had told him it was. 

Now I don't know about most kids, but I never meant any who believed in fake people at twelve. 

So I took him to a therapist, since I figured his Momma's death hurt him, it would help.

He refused to tell the therapist anything about his imaginary friend, or even draw it.

So I asked him why.

""Daddy, Poppy get's mad when you draw them.""

""Son, Poppy isn't real."" That sent him into a quick fit, screaming and crying about Poppy being real. 

I got fed up quick, I might let him get away with his usual 'ideas' and 'fun' things to do, but I was stopping that right fast.

I took him out to the creek where he met 'Poppy', letting him look for his friend. He cried big old tears when his friend didn't show, saying that I had scared Poppy away. 

I thought that was that, so we packed up and went home, and I tucked him in. All warm and safe, if not sad. 

I told him Poppy wasn't real, and kissed him goodnight.

Now as I stand outside his door, and listen to him talk with *something* in his room. I worry that I might have made a mistake.",1620015936.0
I bought my son a new toy,34,7,"It always says hi to me every time I pass by it, I chose to ignore it thinking that it had some sensor on it.

One night I came home from a guys night out since my wife and the kids where at her mothers house, the toy was sitting on top of the toy bin the way my son left him and I said drunkenly “hey there” it replied “hi what would you like to do today” jokingly I said to it, let’s play a game, tell me how bad this smells and I let one rip.

Laughing thinking it will probably not even recognize the sound the toy said out loud “ew that’s nasty”

My smile started to fade just a bit when I thought man this toy has a really good AI.

The toy said “you know it” 

I stood up and my concern rose as I walked over and picked it up thinking that there has to be something up with the toy.

That’s when I discovered the toy had no batteries.

Thinking maybe it had some type of internal battery I put it back down and went to sleep.

The next morning I woke up and went downstairs and it said hi to me and I ignored it, I thought to myself “man I wish I could toss that thing in the trash” I heard the doll say “you’ll never get rid of me” 

My eyes jumped up and I went into the living, grabbed it, took it outside, and immediately trashed it.

Reclaimed by Nature,25,1,"I used to be so competitive. 

Everything was something I had to be good at. If I wasn’t good enough, I was devastated. I’d mourn and snap back to the hunt for the next contest and chance to prove myself.

Not sure how this started, or what happened. 

I think it was Thursday. I came home from work and found a small plant growing out of the floor in my apartment. It was crazy; a real dandelion growing in the crack of a sidewalk, moment, except the plant was something else and instead of being outside, it popped up between two wooden boards.

The second day seemed a little frightening, at first. When I came home, the entire living room floor was covered in rows of three-inch plants in evenly spaced lines. Their purple leaves shimmered in the light from the window and their stems had fine, crystalline hairs that sparkled also.

At first, something that had, the day before, given me joy and a bit of whimsy had become just too much. 

Of course, I posted pictures.

No likes, no nothing, and barely a response. I sent the pic to my bestie and she asked why I was sending a picture of apartment, asked if I cleaned it or something. 

I responded, “no,” got hostile, and went downstairs to investigate my neighbor’s apartment.

When I reached the unit, at first, I thought everything was fine. I almost dreaded going back into my home, I mean, what would I find next? Some kind of fully grown tree? A sloth? A jaguar and a bush? 

No, I had to figure this out. 

I knocked on the door and that’s when it eased open.

“Hello?” I called.

The forest before me made me do a triple-check. The entire entryway and rooms behind looked like they’d been completely reclaimed by nature. 

I backed out slowly.

Next, I checked the floor below the two of us, and this time, I didn’t have to knock, because the door was missing. I walked in to the unit directly below both and found gargantuan tree trunks, shrubs, flowers, leaves, and what sounded like birds, in a humid mist.

I turned to leave, and that’s when a cute gray spider bit me on the arm.

The bite swelled up and was purple before I even got halfway back upstairs.

Ever since then, I’ve been just watching everything grow and reflecting on who I was and used to be. 

I feel incredible. And while I can still move, just enough to type all this out here, my skin’s turning rough. My legs are already rooted, to my favorite spot in the apartment no less. I feel connected. I’m one and touching all. Long white tendrils with spiked hairs flow from where my feet used to be and disappear to the boards below. 

I just wanted to say that I’m sorry. I really should have relaxed about everything a whole lot sooner.

He nuzzled his bald head against her thigh, his tongue lolling and his milky eyes stared blindly.

The victim began to stir... and rattled his chains. The ancient wolf man furrowed his brow. 

Recognition- of the sound.

Drool began to pool at the corner of his mouth and dribble down his scraggly chin.

Correction,42,8,"Warden Devi waved his hand and the teleport gate creaked open.

""Prisoner 1166789 ready for transportation.""

1166789 was Kanaan Singh, a young man who had been found guilty of being overdue with the payment of his Amazon Prime subscription. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.

As the gate groaned shut, Singh adjusted his eyes to the absence of light. He knew what happened next: this device transported you to a destination where you would serve your sentence. Singh started to feel his way around in the dark.

Just as he touched a slimy, cold, throbbing wall the area burst brightly with blue light. The air ionised. He felt his skin burn. He shrieked in agony before collapsing and curling into a foetal position.

Singh soon started to crawl, his skin scraping along the floor, leaving a trail of disused flesh and clothing. His sight faltered as the blue light subsided.

The darkness evaporated and Singh felt himself healing. As his vision returned he found himself lying on the pavement. Around him were grey, monotonous buildings, windowless tower blocks and crumbling factories. Singh pulled himself up.

He heard a voice in his head: ""1166789. Can you hear us?""

Singh was disorientated and didn't respond. The voice repeated its question until he confirmed he could. It then asked what he could see. He described the eerie surroundings.

""Where am I?"" Singh cried out.

""That is irrelevant. You have been transferred correctly for the sake of your sentence.""

He never heard from the voice again.

For days Singh explored the colourless landscape. He found food. It was tasteless but edible. Not once did he come across any other person in this abandoned place.

Neither did he ever come across any city perimeter, even after weeks of walking. It was as if the whole world was one vast, dull city. Singh was in despair.

Weeks turned into months, months into years. Loneliness had wrapped its cloak around him and tightened so much he hallucinated and forged a world of make-believe people. This civilisation went about its business, the joyous routine of their lives satisfying his delusions.

Singh made friendships with his creations. They invited him into their lives. He even married one of them and had two imaginary children with her.

As time passed his history became exactly that. His imprisonment was a cancelled memory.

Finally, he forgot that all of it was residing in his imagination. It was now reality.

One day, Singh felt unwell. His wife called the Doctor who informed her that her husband was displaying the initial signs of a stroke.

As his brain malfunctioned, his make-believe world mutated. The change in his mind's structure turned everyone into damaged, disfigured cripples. The buildings became haunting titans of deformed metal and cement. Every last atom was affected.

Singh's world metamorphosed into a nightmarish existence. Everyone started accusing him, berating him for making them suffer like this.

Birthdays,1172,31,"When I awoke the sun had already risen, I bolted out of bed in a panic.

&#x200B;

“Emma!” I bellowed, bounding down the stairs three at a time and bursting into the kitchen. 

&#x200B;

“Happy birthday, Papa…” she said sheepishly, midway through pouring my coffee. I breathed a deep sigh.

&#x200B;

""You shouldn't have let me sleep in, now we're behind,"" I grumbled.

&#x200B;

""It's okay, Papa, I've already made breakfast.""

&#x200B;

“So… how many more birthdays today?”

&#x200B;

“Just one, Mary Billings.”

&#x200B;

We pulled a wagon full of supplies on our five mile walk through the deserted town. Once we arrived at the gates Emma took out her notebook and scanned through it.

&#x200B;

“Mary Billings… hmmm… row nine, six over,” she declared. I grabbed my shovel and made my way to the plot while Emma began double-checking the dates on all the stones. 

&#x200B;

“Papa, come quick!” I had just broken through the soil when I heard her panicked call. I jogged to where she was standing, pointing at the ground. My heart sunk when I saw the pile of fresh soil. Somehow, we had missed one. 

&#x200B;

“Ah,” Emma pointed at an entry in her journal, “You wrote the death date from this plot, not the birth date.”

&#x200B;

“Well… That’s exactly why you took this over,” I said, forcing a weak chuckle.

&#x200B;

They always come back on their birthdays. Always. 

&#x200B;

No one realized the pattern when this began six months ago. It was pure panic. The living were hunted and turned into undead while more rose from their graves each day. 

&#x200B;

Emma was the one who discovered the birthday connection, right after her mother came bursting through our kitchen window, shrieking and wailing and snapping her rotten teeth at us. It had been Emma’s small voice, wise beyond her eleven years, that took me out of my petrified stupor.

&#x200B;

*“Shoot it, Papa, it’s not Mama anymore!”*

Since her realization we'd taken a preemptive approach, digging them up and shooting them before they can get free.

""Damnit... shit,"" I mumbled, walking to the wagon to retrieve my shotgun. I had just reached it when I heard screaming. The corpse had come out of the trees and was rushing at Emma. 

&#x200B;

I didn't dare take a shot in her direction. Cursing, I sprinted toward them, watching as Emma ducked behind a headstone and the ghoul's grasping hands nearly caught her hair. 

&#x200B;

""Hey, over here!"" I called, hoping to distract it. It looked at me for a split second before continuing its pursuit. 

 

I moved faster than I ever had before, closing the gap between us and swinging the machete down. The blade took its head off with ease, slicing through decayed flesh like melting butter. It fell at my feet, still gnashing its teeth. 

&#x200B;

Emma looked up at me, eyes wide, but unscathed. I pulled her up and carried her away, ignoring the pain from the bite on my ankle, already feeling the change.

The Beaten Path,30,8,"Two boulders shaped like rounded giant’s teeth marked the trail-head.  The path between them was well-beaten in spite of the fact that the only one person from our village per year trod it.  Adorned by thick bushes and the canopy overhead, it laid flat like a brown tongue and disappeared behind a slight bump.  This was the first and only time I would be on it and I trembled more than the windless leaves watching my first few steps.  I felt the forest swallow me.

Sweat tickled it’s way through my hair and down my forehead and I wished I could escape the woods as easily.  It was hot in here and humid.  In any other shaded area the temperature drops ten, perhaps twenty degrees.  Here the air was thick and stagnant.  It entered my nose and lungs like molasses suffocatingly.  The scent in the air was sickeningly sweet.

Rounding the bend, I caught sight of a creamy, brownish-yellow post and I had to steady myself.  I had hoped, prayed really, that I wouldn’t see it.  I had secretly wished that this fence and what was beyond was nothing but a hoax or a wives’ tale in our town.  I knew, of course, because of the tributes who never came back that there was something to it, but I didn’t want it to be real.  Yet there it began, the first of many posts which made up the fence.  As I approached the stench, heat and humidity swelled.  I gagged while walking along it.  It was comprised of bones wrapped together in sinew and skin.  Hands grabbed spines which skewered through femurs on top of toes.  And in between, I could see the mouldering shack where it lived.

I wanted to run, but would not.  The tribute process could not be denied.  One year our village scoffed and made none.  No one living wished to repeat what had happened as a result.

This is why I was here, standing before the macabre gates adorned by infantile skulls.  Each of their black sockets were a silent story the wide, open jaws couldn’t tell.  Most were clean, but there were a few which had some leathery jerky stuck in their hinges and between their teeth.  The Andrews boy, last year’s offer, was easily recognizable.  His shock of blond hair had grown since then and his eyeballs had only been half-eaten.  I closed my eyes against seeing his tongue jutting out.

I knelt in front of the gate, like I was told.  It wasn’t long before it opened before me.  My heart started racing as I held out my arms.  Jenna cooed trustingly and stared into my eyes.  Her light red hair was as soft as her features.  She smiled and a single tear drop committed suicide from my cheek.

“I’m so sorry,” I whispered.

The Cost of Divorce,302,18,"We bought our marriage certificate for $5.

That’s cheaper than a Venti Pumpkin Spice Latte from a certain well-known coffee shop chain.

We were never head over heels for each other, but we got along just fine. A stranger might’ve called it love. (Sometimes I believed that I loved him, that he loved me too.) In a moment of impulsiveness, we even had a kid. Raising a child was expensive as hell, but I never resented the money that I spent on my daughter. My little girl deserved the best that money could buy.

I suppose we were a happy family, for a time.

Then he started seeing that whore. 

I knew where the money was going the moment I saw those unfamiliar charges in our bank statement.

I’m not a vindictive person. I’m just practical.

I would’ve left him to his indiscretions, would’ve let him be. I would’ve ignored the prick of anger that I felt when I saw how she made him happier than I ever could. But he was spending so much money on her. (Money that he never would’ve spent on me.) Money that should’ve been for my daughter. He rented an apartment in the city center for his woman, paid for her gambling debts. I don’t know how he expected me to not notice, to not mind.

I could never have afforded a divorce. A divorce would mean giving him half the money and letting a greedy lawyer take a good chunk of the other half. How could I pay for my daughter’s college then?

After walking into my room I instinctively tapped the top of the door frame as it was like second nature for me to do that. I gazed around my bedroom and spotted my old teddy bear still resting on his usual spot in between my pillows. He had kept me safe from monsters on numerous occasions. 

I went over to the kitchen and started opening presses at random to see if there was anything nice to eat. Unsurprisingly there was nothing as my father was never the kind of man to have a large supply of treats.

I picked up an old Nokia mobile phone that was lying in one of the presses and was surprised to see it still had a battery life left even though it probably hadn't been used in months. I pocketed the phone as I used to play Snake on it.

I pulled the light cord and went down to the basement and wandered around aimlessly for a few minutes. I looked down an item lying on the bench and shuddered.

“My next trick is the famous Hindustanee rings. You will notice that the rings are apparently separate; at a blow they all join (clang, clang, clang)-Presto!” 

There was a general buzz of stupefaction till the Quick Man was heard to whisper. “He–must–have– another– lot–up–his–sleeve.” Again everybody nodded and whispered, “The–rings–were–up–his–sleeve.”

It went on like that all through. It transpired from the whispers of the Quick Man as my reputation of was rapidly sinking below zero. At the close of the evening, I rallied for a final effort.

“Will you, sir,” I continued, turning toward the Quick Man, “will you kindly come to stage” He obliged. “Have I your permission to put you in this wooden box for the trick” I asked. The Quick Man nodded and fitted himself in the box. I covered the lid carefully and nail it down.

“Now ladies and gentlemen, I will cut this box in two parts using a chainsaw.” The audience cheered.

And In a snap, the machine buzzed and I cut the box in a half.

Amid the cheering of audience, buzzing of saw and orchestra music the screams were lost.

The Rotten Queen,150,6,"In the time before the Twin Goddesses left their flawed creations behind, there lived a wise woman, who lived alone in a quiet cottage in the wilderness. She was one of the first sorceresses, and was wildly talented. Long before the ways of magic were known, she found ways to twist the world to her whims.

Still, she used these powers for good, healing those who came to her and brewing teas that could cure any ailment. But men are weary of what they don't know. The final straw was when she was delivered a body, two weeks old and perfectly preserved, and breathed new life into it. 

She was deemed a witch, and a pillory was built in her cottage. They forced her into the shackles, and simply left.

But she wouldn't die. Even when her stomach screamed from hunger and her tongue scraped her teeth like sand, she lived. The magic coursing through her veins would never allow her an easy exit.
Days turned to weeks, to months, to years, and eventually she found her way out. Her flesh bubbled and sloughed into green and grey streaks, exposing the bone below. The meat melted from her face into stinking puddles and her clothes, long since turned to dust, gave birth to new life; spores, born of decay, and embodying it.

The spores ate through the wood, made it soft and brittle, and at long last she was free. Her body was never found.

To Keep in Line With My Diet,34,0,"I placed the hand onto the food scale, the thud it made when it came in contact with the platform was frighteningly loud. 

At the start of the month, I set two goals; I'd start a diet, and start lifting weights. 

I suppose killing someone kind of got in the way of both goals. 

I had uselessly stared at the body which was laying at my feet in an awkward position for 20 minutes or so. Then tried to get rid of it in an even more useless way; I managed to drag it a good 2 and a half metres away from the house before I gave up. 

I pulled it by its stiff, cold ankles up the stairs to the guest room, the head thumping on each stair. 

14 hours later, I was bent over the food scale, watching the numbers rise quickly. The hand weighed a good 1200 grams. 1090 more grams than what my meal plan said I could have. 

No matter. 

The kitchen knife had a hard time cutting through the annoyingly tough skin. After a little force, it cut right through. I repeated this over and over again, the fingers making an uncomfortable squelch as blood squirted through the cut and onto the cutting board. 

I individually weighed each piece of the mangled mix of exposed flesh and skin and blood until the food scale showed 110 grams. 

After many squelches and squirts, the pinkie finger and a tiny bit of the palm weighed 112 grams together. 

Close enough.

My wife wants me to get pregnant,10,2,"My wife gave birth a year ago and we both went through it all really well. We adapted and made the necessary changes in our lives to make it easier to having a baby. We were both surprised how well we were both coping as parents. There were a few tough spots but we both got through it and showed up stronger on the other side. It's great being a parent, well it's great for me and my wife any how. Not all couples can survive the baby stage of a relationship and the changes can seriously break people. 

My wife then started hinting to me about wanting a second child and at first I was against it but then warmed up to it. My wife then started getting excited and she started getting baby things and preparing a room for the second baby. She kept asking me what kind of room I would like for the second baby, this confused me as it's usually the mothers who get to decide what kind of baby room they would like. She kept asking me about what colours I wanted and what kind of materials like carpets and rugs I wanted in the new baby room. I laughed and said ""hey you are going to be the pregnant one so you get to decide"" 

My wife looked at me in such horror and replied ""what do you mean about me being the pregnant one again? I have already been pregnant and so it's your turn now"" and I was confused. I then told her ""I'm a man I can't get pregnant"" and she became more emotional and hostile and shouted ""it's not fair that I got pregnant once and you are not going to have a go!"" And I told her to explain to me how a man could get pregnant? 

She then told me of a special treatment that can make men get pregnant as well and she thought everyone knew about it. When I saw this treatment I was shocked and this treatment only existed in her home town in the whole world. The babies the men gave birth to didn't come our right but father deformed and I looked at my wife and told her I'm not getting pregnant. We argued back and forth how it's not fair that only she got pregnant and I haven't. That in a relationship both must share the same experiences. 

I stood my ground and then my wife took our baby and ran away, the next thing that happened to me was the townspeople of men and woman started wiping blood on my house windows. Blood that belonged to dead featuses. I moved with in my wife in her home town where she knows everyone. People screaming that I am selfish for not wanting to get pregnant. People started leaving dead featuses and wombs that have been taken out of women, at front door.

Worm Guy,933,74,"Hey, uh, you got a minute?

Do you know Tilly? Of course you know Tilly. Everyone knows Tilly. I met him at a party, and he just sauntered on up to me and asked me if I liked fucked up shit. I shrugged and asked him “is that a come on?” and, you know, we were best buds after that.

A few days later, or maybe weeks, who the fuck can tell time anymore, right? When everything is a dull, formless nothing, time isn’t really a thing, you know? Anyway, Tilly introduced me to the Worm Guy, and I was like, man, that’s an unfortunate nickname, but Tilly assured me that he had the Stuff. Capital S.

So Tilly left me with the Worm Guy in a dirty motel bathroom, and I suddenly felt, I don’t know, nervous?

Anyway, he pulled out this box, and opened it in my face, like some sort of unveiling. And man… They were so fucked up, the worms. Tiny, white, slimy things, hundreds of them, writhing in imperfect disharmony. But there was something else.

Faces. They had faces. Tiny, pale, animated human faces.

I stared at them for a while, you know? Figured maybe I’d recognize a face or two. I didn’t though, so I figured, *fuck it*, I’ll give them a taste. Slurped them down like wriggling noodles. Tasted like shit too.

And the screams…

You ever step on a baby? Not just stepping on it by accident, but really going in for the damage, you know? Sounded just like that.

That’s when I *really* noticed the Worm Guy, you know? Pasty face, sweaty bulging fat flaps. No clothes. He was naked the whole time, I swear on it. So there I was, standing in a filthy motel bathroom, feasting on screaming human-faced worms fed to me by a naked, morbidly obese man.

Not just naked either, it was something...under his skin. Something moving under his skin. And then I saw them, crawling out of him. Out of his every fucking orifice. Hundreds, thousands, of those things.

Then he, I guess he, uh, he fucking dissolved. He *became* those things. Or they became him? Worm Guy turned into a massive pile of worms. How’s that for irony?

You know, I thought about leaving. Would be the sane thing to do I guess. But I couldn’t do that. It was just too good. The high man, the low, the everything. It’s life, unlife, and everything in between.

So I ate him. Every last, screaming, slithering piece of him. And I’d do it again in a heartbeat.

You look like a nice fella, you know? You can sell me, sure, but you won’t. Believe me, you won’t. I can feel them, you know, inside. They want out. They want someone new. And I swear, it’s the best feeling.

Just make sure, uh, make sure to eat every last wriggling piece of me, yeah?",1619912494.0
Gods Don't Sleep At Night,164,12,"*Gods don't sleep at night,*

*But they watch you when you do;*

*So when I go to close my eyes,*

*Remember to close yours, too.*

&#x200B;

I never understood the rhyme that mother sang to me every night, but then there again, I never understood a lot of things. Like why the snow my father tracks into the house never melts, why the strung-up line of rodent and bird corpses hanging from our ceiling have their eyes all gouged out, or why all the windows are boarded up with steel plates.

But good kids don't ask questions, and good kids don't bother mommy and daddy while they worked. So I went down into the basement to find my scuttling, wriggling, burrowing friends. I put a big, shiny black beetle on my tongue. The chewing comes naturally afterwards.

As I grow older, the fog of boredom dissipates into an itching, restless anxiety for some explanation. I would wander upstairs to find my mother and father diligently at work, digging their knives into the exposed sockets of lifeless animals. With a practiced flick and twist of the wrist, the eyeballs detach with a few thin strands of sinew in-between, and fall within a small bucket. Sometimes I see father dump the bucket outside. His silence absorbed my questions like moss to a raindrop.

They always refused my pleas to be included. So I sulk by the corner where the snow my father tracked in in still hasn't melted - they've accumulated in the little crevices and creases of the floor.

Still I begged, day after day, for them to let me see outside. And one day, my mother finally relented after seeing the tears on my face.

She lifts up a small corner of the metal sheets covering our windows, and allows me to peer out into the world. What I saw, I barely comprehend.

Flesh, nothing but flesh in the pink, pale sky. There is no sky, only the undulating form of veinous, gelatinous flesh that folded upon itself. Tendrils miles long stretched from the formless monstrosity to the earth, searching, writhing, tasting. Within its folds are countless eyes - millions frantically blinking and watching in every possible direction. The eyes well up with tears that ran from rivulets into a flood. Endless streams of salt rain cascaded from the sky, coagulating into *snow* that never melted.

My mind burned with static in its gaze. There are shapes beneath it, humanoid, eyeless, wandering. Father pours a bucket of eyes out on our front porch. A tendril takes our offering, and retreats back into the all-seeing sky.

""As long as it has its eyes, it won't take ours."" Mother whispers to me.

The eyes search aimlessly. A pressure starts to build in my skull, and before my own eyes burst from the pain, mother shuts the window.

Venomous Lobes,5,2,"I fell in love with a woman that wore snakes for earrings. Every day I would see her on the other side of the street, wearing sunglasses and snakes for earrings.

*She* wouldn't look at me but her snakes would, with their beady eyes and flickering tongues.

Then one day I saw her walking along without the snakes in her ears.

""Hey..."" I crossed the road and waved her down. ""Where are the snakes that you usually have in your ears?""

She said, ""Oh, they're in my bag. Would you like to touch them?""

""Yes, please.""

""You're not some thief, are you?""

""No,"" I replied, as she unzipped her bag. ""Can you put them in your ears, please?""

""Quite polite for a stranger...""

""Nothing wrong with some manners...Anyhow, where did you get these glorious snake earrings? I'll have to find some for my daughter. It's her birthday next week.""

She showed me the webpage. There were hundreds of varieties to choose from - different colours and sizes.

""How about a date?""

""I'm sorry, I don't date single fathers.""

When I went home I found the perfect snake earrings for my daughter. Quite pricey.

The package arrived and I opened the box. The snakes were curled up fast asleep, so I didn't disturb them. Inside a plastic bag they'd provided a needle for piercing the ear.

\--

On my daughter's birthday, I handed her my present, eager as can be.

She shook it.

Silence.

She unwrapped it.

The snakes were awake, looking at us both.

""Dada,"" she said, ""Wha-- are dees snakes?""

""Yes, honey, they are. Isn't this the best birthday present you've ever received?""

""Potty, daddy.""

I had the needle ready in between my fingers now. ""Come here,"" I said, ""Then you can have these two bad boys in your ears. How cool is that!""

My gorgeous girl, she'd look wonderful.

I wish she wasn't so tentative.

Why must she race from the room?

*Oh*, she's up in our bedroom!

I stood by the bottom of the stairs. I'd wait as long as I'd have to.",1619996925.0
Radio Ouija,131,26,"Danny, Clark and I sat in the candle-lit basement around an old radio.  Danny had said that he’d created this game and he wanted to explain it. 

“It’s kind of a creepy game, guys,” he said.  We looked at each other mischievously as we sank into an ominous atmosphere.  “It’s called Radio Ouija,” he continued.  “This is not like regular Ouija.  There’s no board.  Just the pentagram I wrote on the floor in red chalk, these five red candles and this old radio.”  My skin crawled as he explained.  He was doing such a good job of setting the mood.  I rubbed my hands in anticipation. 

He waited and the pregnant pause suddenly birthed Clark’s question, “And then?”  

“And then,” he went on.  “We set the radio to an AM station that doesn’t come in perfectly clear.  There has to be static.  That’s important.  After that, we turn the radio off and think of a question to ask.  Once we’ve asked it, we turn the radio on and wait for the first clear word, then turn it off again.  We do this over and over again until we have a complete message…… or it just becomes clear that the message is gobbledygook.”  We all laughed as he broke the tension with that little joke.  “Alright, our first question, what should it be?” he asked. 

“What about:  Is there a spirit willing to talk to us tonight?” I asked and we all thought that would be a good one, so we asked and turned the radio on. 

We heard heavy static over a voice.  Soon, the first clear word we heard was:  *Hey.*  So we turned it off. 

“Should we stop there?” I asked. 

Clark replied, “I don’t think that’s a definite yes.  I say we go for a full sentence.”  I agreed and we turned the station on again.  The buzzing white noise soon cleared for the word:  *Guys.*

“Okay, we’re going for a sentence,” Clark continued pushing the button off and then on again. 

Very clearly, immediately and loudly the speakers blared:  *HELP.*

“Holy shit!” I exclaimed almost pissing myself.  “That’s fucking freaky.” 

Clark had turned a little pale, but forced a grin and said, “Let’s ask a different question.  I doubt very highly that it’ll work again.  Let’s ask:  How can we help you?” 

Agreeing, we both said in unison: “How can we help you?” 

There was just that electric hush for quite a while, but then one word broke through:  *Remember.*  Quickly we clicked the button twice and heard:  *Me.*  After that, it went back to nothing. 

“We should ask who they are,” I said.  We eagerly bent back towards the radio. 

The next few words were indecipherable nonsense.  It almost sounded like someone who was being mixed in a blender.  We waited a while, but both decided to go home. 

Leaving the basement, Clark asked me, “Where’d you hear of that game anyway?” 

Chuckling nervously, I said, “I was going to ask you the same thing.”",1619933211.0
Impartial Justice,30,14,"Raymond drove up to the gate of his neighborhood. He saw the leering grins of the three security guards on duty. Oh great, he thought to himself as he slowed down. *This* again.

He rolled down his window as he came to a stop. ""Hi, fellas. How's your day going?""

""License and registration?"" The red-haired guard's eyes burned with ferocity.

Raymond already had that ready. ""*Really*, guys? We go through this every time. You *know* I live here."" He handed over the paperwork.

The hairy guard shuffled nearby; he scrutinized Raymond closely. ""You match the description of someone who just knocked over a liquor store, out in the nearby town."" The burly guard already had his trunk open, and was rifling through it.

Raymond sighed. ""You *know* I'm not like that. Besides, you can see what's in here.""

The red-haired guard punched up something on his PDA. ""This isn't your car.""

Raymond let out a small chuckle. ""No, it's my stepdad's car. We don't have the same last name. You know that *too*.""

The burly guard slammed the trunk shut. At that instant, the hairy guard whipped out his baton and held it menacingly, twitching. ""Don't sass us! We can strip this car down to the frame if we wanted!""

Raymond smiled wryly. ""My stepdad would be *pissed* if you did that. Do you *really* want to answer to him?""

The security guards froze. None of them spoke for several seconds. Raymond gazed at them, bored. ""Can I go now?""

As the red-haired guard handed Raymond his paperwork, a growl stirred from the burly guard. ""We've got our eyes on you. Don't get out of line, you little punk!""

""Guys, look, if you're *really* this bored, I can bring you by something. Some of my mom's cookies? Games and puzzles? Comic books? *Whatever* you like!""

""*Move along, sir!*"" The hairy guard waved Raymond through, as another car pulled up behind him. He drove off without saying another word.

This was getting out of hand. He'd have to talk to his stepfather about this.

-----

As Raymond approached the gate the next morning, the security guards were nowhere to be found. He was surprised to find gleaming metal robots jump out of the guard shack. They stopped him.

""License and registration?"" The metallic voice vibrated with authority.

Raymond smiled as he handed them over. Finally, some impartial justice! He could get used to this.

An alarm sounded from within the robot guard; the other two followed quickly with their own. ""You are wanted for felony vandalism! Hands in the air, *now*!""

Raymond's heart skipped a beat as he thrust his arms upwards. What was going on?

All three robot guards belched a staccato imitation of a laugh. ""Just kidding. We hope our fun-loving antics have endeared you to us. On your way, citizen!"" The robot guard handed Raymond his paperwork, and motioned him forward with a graceful sweep of his arm.

Raymond couldn't leave fast enough. He missed the old guards already.",1619954403.0
The Voices Outside,34,11,"My therapist came up with a way for me to better deal with my negative, self-critical thoughts. I have many of them. *You’re such a loser. You suck. That was incredibly stupid.* These came at me multiple times a day. 

She shared that for a start, I’m to realise that these thoughts all come from my inner critic, and they are not necessarily true. Thoughts aren’t reality. My inner critic can lobby insults and taunts at me all she wants, but she has no power over me. 

We started off by naming my inner critic. I decided to name her Katrina. I was also asked to draw how I thought she looked like. I scrawled out a tall, skinny lady with a long sharp nose, who was perpetually tight-lipped and frowning.

It’s sometimes a pretty fun way to deal with my negative thoughts. When I had thoughts like *you’re a failure*, I would snap back, aloud, “Shut up, Katrina!”

I also started drawing her into comic strips. I’d feature her as a clumsy, stupid villain, while my protective side, named Harriet, was the kickass heroine. 

I kept drawing the comic strips, practicing talking back to Katrina, giving Harriet a louder voice, and over time, I felt the balance within me shift. I was just a little bit more confident, and a ray of sunshine was peeking through my perpetual dark clouds. 

One night, I drew Katrina grimacing as Harriet blasted a laser at her.

“That’s not what I look like”. An unnaturally high-pitched, childlike voice spoke in a sing-song manner, right beside my left ear, the cold breath tickling my ear lobes. I could almost feel the lips brush my ear. I froze. I didn’t dare to turn, to look to my left. My eyes stayed glued to the front. 

“Don’t you wanna see how I really look like?” The voice spoke again, this time a coy whisper in my right ear.

I wanted to draw on, to ignore it, but my fingers wouldn’t move. I steeled myself, bracing for any sudden movements from the thing with the voice.

It lightly hopped forward, a flash of white and red, and I looked down, refusing to look at it. 

“I think I’m pretty. Don’t you?” The childish, piping voice went on. 

I stared down resolutely, cold beads of sweat forming on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, which had gone icy cold. 

It swooped forward suddenly, pale face looming directly in front of mine. “LOOK AT ME!” The voice had changed, taking on a hellishly low and broken timbre, which blended into the original falsetto. Even staring down, I couldn’t help but make out the pale skin, blood red lips and sharp canine teeth. 

Cold hard hands gripped the sides of my head. “Look at me.” It spoke again, now once gain in the voice of a little girl. 

Heart pounding, I slowly lifted my head.",1619948193.0
