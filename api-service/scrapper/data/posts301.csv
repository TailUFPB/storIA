In 2088, the earth was reconquered.;21;9;"  

In 2088, the earth was reconquered. 

The MENACE was chased underground. Their dwellings were razed & \[reinfested\]. None of their STAINS remains on the surface.

The document will hopefully detail our final victory. It contains transcriptions of a speech by the great prime minister and a public letter by our beloved industry leader, both addressed to this great nation. There might be disruptions **from the outside**, citizens are advised to ignore them.

“We shall begin the great \[Reinfestation\] of the UNIVERSE, As is our Right! As Foretold, over &over!”

“Our forefathers began this project in the depths of space. A great culling of the *\[Listen Closely\]*

“These cancerous growths will be harvested again.""

 *\[The factory lines.* *Inside boxes, my children are still alive\]*

""There is nothing to fear from the spread of this great civilization.""

Nothing to fear

*Nothing to fear*

*Nothing to fear*

 Ladies and gentlemen  
 

I know this letter reaches you in times of great discussion on the inhuman issue. The Industry is open to all discussion, but please, remember that honest debate is based upon truth and facts.

Below are all OBJECTIVE facts on the case. If you cannot acknowledge these simple, objective facts and instead resort to baseless rumors, then what is even the point of discussion?

Objective fact: The \[MENACE\] are not humans. Human DNA was not utilized in their creation.

Objective fact: The \[MENACE\] cannot cry, their tear ducts were removed in the designing process.

Objective fact: Men are OWED their property. The mutations were created by our great FRIENDS. To restrict man's dominion over his work is violation of the God given rights of the corporation, as set out in the Old Testament(2nd Clarified edition, 2077)
   
 

Objective fact: Our great FRIENDS were LEGALLY and FAIRLY judged in a court of law as not to blame for the ""Eyeless children"" incident. We should not be expected to pay expenses, the eyeless children do not eat. The eyeless children are not classified as ""life"" as far as we know. They may be **\[from the outside\]**  
   
 

*Unborn*  

 *Birthless*


*Long fingers hold open the door and let them in to us*  
 

*Our blood invites the flies and the wolves. Our blood invites the flies and the wolves. Our blood invites the flies and the wolves.*  
 

Objective fact: The undergoing excavation of the underground tunnels have unveiled barbarous and uncivilized superstitions among the inhumans. The recent construction of the ""flesh walls"" and “rivers of eyes” demonstrate their savagery and incompatibility with basic human values.

How can we recognize them as equals, they who worship, this “Eyeless mind from the stars”?  
 

*Mothers, fathers, we are sorry.* 

*Cannot forgive*

*They will now descend*

Objective fact: Mankind needs all the resources we can get. The figure from the moon is rapidly approaching.

 *Oh Mother of all orphans, cradle the motherless* 

*Before the Eyeless Fear comes crawling down from the stars.*";16199473050
3 Anecdotes that are Completely Unrelated;1351;29;"The following anecdotes are separate stories. Do not attempt to connect them.

A young boy squishes insects between his fingers. He loves slowly compressing them, watching as their little legs flail wildly. Sometimes, with larger bugs, he can completely flatten a part of their bodies, and they will still be struggling. His mother, concerned about this behavior, buys him a puppy to teach him empathy. A week later, he claims the puppy ran away. The issue is not addressed again.

There are a genre of videos on the internet that focus around things being crushed. For the most part, these fall into the “satisfying” type of video. Slime, stress toys, and the like are put under compressors, car tires, or boots, and their destruction is recorded. The people who make these videos make quite a large sum of money on them. There are also people who are willing to pay to watch *other things* be crushed, I’ve heard, but those are only rumours. 

So far, the corpses of 7 women have been discovered. Each of them have been found with rather...odd injuries. On one woman, the doctor who performed her autopsy claimed that the bones in her arms and legs were “basically dust”. On another, her nose was completely flattened, her skull had dozens of fractures, and her eyes were dangling from their sockets. I will spare you the details of the other girls, but I’m sure you could imagine the horrifying injuries. A tripod was discovered at the scene of the latest body. No suspects have been taken into custody at this time.

These 3 anecdotes have nothing to do with each other. They are not related in any way. Do not look too deeply into it. You will not like what you find.";16198616610
The Khat Chewers;13;5;"I saw my first khat chewer in Kenya.

I was attending an international conference on physical cosmology, and while strolling back to my hotel after an edifying day of lectures—Copernicus, quantum mechanics and CMBR sloshing about my head—he appeared:

Or appeared his eyes, reflecting the streetlights.

I stopped.

His face remained dark.

He stared at me and I at him, and all the while he chewed.

Slowly; dumbly, like a human cow.

Not saying a word.

Eventually my companion, a hired local named Kirui, grabbed me by the arm and pulled me away. “Don’t mind him,” Kirui said. “He’s harmless, just a khat chewer.”

*Khat*: a flowering plant native to east Africa chewed for its alkaloid, cathinone, an amphetamine-like compound causing excitement and euphoria.

Except the khat chewer had looked anything but euphoric.

Even in my hotel room, alone and in the dark, did his eyes remain: staring at me from a face of memory melting into nightmare—

I awoke, cold, wet, but remembering nothing from my fever dream save for a peculiar sensation of reality somehow condensing into me.

In the late morning, I went to a lecture on cosmic expansion but could not focus.

My thoughts were scattered, limp.

During the lunch break, I drank three cups of coffee but they didn’t help. Several colleagues tried to speak with me; I ignored them.

Until bumping into—

“Here is the leaf that begins all life worth having!”

*What?*

The man staring back at me, with slight bewilderment, was Dr. Mukherjee, under whom I had earned my doctorate at MIT.

“Gilgamesh,” he said. “The name of—”

I felt a sudden tightening in my chest. Gilgamesh had been the name of my first (and most famous) contribution to the field of cosmology: a software model of the beginnings of the universe.

“Are you alright?”

“Yes,” I said, pushing past him, but now changing direction and heading for the doors leading outside—

Through which I pushed into the blinding noonday sun.

My hand firm against my chest.

*Palpitations.*

People staring at me—

Evading—

“Kirui!” I yelled out. “Kirui, are you here?”

He materialized obediently as if out of the local ether. “Yes, sir.”

“Take me to the place we passed last night. To where we saw the khat chewer,” I said in syncopation.

When we arrived, he was there.

His jaws masticating.

“Leave us,” I told Kirui. When he had gone, the khat chewer stood and in his eyes I felt an understanding. I followed him into a building, down a ladder, deeper and deeper into a hole, until time meant nothing: until my feet touched ground:

An underground chamber of impossible proportions.

The inward pressure was immense.

Through the permanent gloam I gazed rows and rows of khat chewers.

I sat among them.

I willingly received my leaf.

*The expansion of the universe is slowing. There is too much matter. And the only thing preventing collapse—pushing against it with each grinding motion—is us:* the khat chewers, *dutifully delaying the inevitable.*";16199339790
Hope;21;3;"People are always asking me how I feel about being homeless. At least those that aren’t telling me to “beat feet” and “get out of town, you worthless bum!” do.  That doesn’t bother me much, though. I just take it a day at a time; one town to the next…one underpass, park bench, and part-time shelter to another. “How do you keep going on?” they ask. “What’s your secret?” Well, it’s nothing much. It’s just that I’ve got Hope deep down inside me that just keeps me going. It’s Hope that sustains me, motivates me, nourishes me, and generally keeps me alive. 

Yep, ever since Hope came into my life, things have been going better for me. I’d lost my job, my home, and my family; generally, I’d just hit rock bottom. Life on the streets was hard for me, always exposed to the elements; hungry, cold or hot, and threatened by other drifters like myself. Some of those guys were absolutely crazy! They would often beat and rob me. 

Hope found me in the gutter where I lay one evening, last July, depressed and full of self-pity. She wormed her way right into my body, and there she still lives, today. 

Not that she always stays in there. No…no way, sir! Each night, after the sun’s set, I feel her preparing for her grand exit. It starts with a churning in the pit of my gut, followed by some sharp, gloriously-painful stretching of my internal pathways. Then, in a surge of acidic, bile-filled ectasy, she claws her way up my esophagus, unhinges and shoves apart my jaws, and spills upon the ground. As I watch, awestruck at her beauty, Hope’s pile of black, green, and brown flesh and fluid develops an internal structure just like my own. She’s a sight to behold! Unfortunately, whenever she does that, I’m straight-up whooped and I’ve got to take a nap. It’s okay, though, she takes good care of me while I sleep.

First thing she does is to handle my dietary needs. She’s literally my stomach. When the night is nearly over, I’m awakened to a bloated, sustenance-filled Hope dripping, squeezing, and cramming herself down my throat. After she’s resettled within my abdomen, her knife-like tendrils pierce into my digestive tract, and I know a glorious meal is about to be pumped into my system. Soon, life-giving energy floods into my veins and I’m ready for another day. 

Where does she go while I’m sleeping? I don’t really know and I don’t ask. I have my suspicions. For instance, I’ve noticed that those other drifters don’t come around much, anymore. For some reason, I don’t believe the local newspaper headlines that speculate how our local police force have cleaned up the streets. I’m still here, after all…

Well...usually...but not tonight. Tonight, Hope found us a nice, unlocked crawlspace in a cushy, suburban neighborhood. Hope really seems like she's excited to meet the family who lives here…";16199226500

I Love Video Games;7;1;"My favorite pastime is playing video games. I have a lot of them. When I get home from work, I play them to relax. Currently I'm really enjoying this action game I grabbed on sale for a couple of bucks. 

I was a bit low on cash, so I started off by robbing a bank. I managed to snatch a nice $10,000,000. Of course there were guards to stop me, but that's no big deal for me, I've gotten quite good at it. Guards fall to the ground fairly easily, but it takes a few more hits to kill them. With all the money I gathered I may get myself a nice sniper rifle soon, or a double-barreled shotgun. Maybe I'll put acid on the ammo as well so it does some more damage.

Sometimes I need to go to places by boat. Today I saw a nice yacht but I forgot I wanted to steal it and it got really chaotic. I had placed this fancy detonatable explosive inside the control room, and the yacht was on the bottom of the seafloor in a matter of minutes. I heard some screams as I drove off with my own boat, but I was aware there were some people inside the yacht. It's a pity, I wanted to keep the yacht to myself, but I'm sure I'll find another sometime.

Just now I was walking on the street and stabbing people. Without an objective, I roam the city, grab any melee weapon I have on me and run around with it like a crazy guy. Melee weapons really are my favorites. Guns are so boring, you shoot someone, they fall to the ground and that's it. With melee weapons they sometimes survive the first few hits, but you can finish them off with a throat stab or the mighty skull crush. 



Anyway, that's my day so far. I'm pretty exhausted. 



I might go and play this action game I told you about this night to relax.

Grown Your Own Fish At Home;28;4;"That's what the advertisement said: ""Grown Your Own Fish At Home...using our tremendous and highly acclaimed FISH LIQUID!""

*Grown*...For some reason I excused the error.

The supposedly magic juice was presented in an 8ml glass jar which, rather carelessly, I dared to put my nose to. Under the lid I probed and with the merest sniff I vomited all over my clothes; vinegar and faeces were the resonating notes. To the washing machine I went. Well, it wasn't a promising start, my experience could only improve from this point.

So I followed the instruction manual, pouring the liquid into well-watered soil, and then waiting three days to assess the progress.

On that third day a small eye emerged through the dirt. Unmistakably round, the large black pupil staring back at me. I read the instructions, sprinkling a tablespoon of salt over the eye, and returned to my house.

What happened two days later I couldn't have predicted.

Upon waking up, I heard a wet slapping sound through my gaping window, and saw on the patio an enormous fish with large sharp teeth and a long curved neck. It was trying to roll itself down to the lounge doors.

""Remarkable,"" I told myself.

I went downstairs to let it inside. Enormous, it was. Must've been over fifteen feet in length. Its flesh was wet and a gargling sound escaped from its permanently open mouth, from which its tongue occasionally wriggled. Having reread the instructions the night before, I had already prepared the lemon and herb water, along with the sweetcorn salad - apparently its favourite first meal.

As you might imagine - due to its size - it had considerable trouble manoeuvring about my house. Desperately I dragged the sofa, then my table and chairs, just so that it could turn and roll over again, its sloppy flesh leaving slime across the floor. That was fine though, I didn't mind.

When I returned from the kitchen I saw that it had somehow made it onto the sofa, and was flicking through the channels.

""Amazing,"" I whispered. ""We're going to have a great time together. Budge up.""

And we sat there until the hours of the morning, sharing food, and talking - in our own way - and I caressed its dripping flesh with my eager fingers.";16199046830
It's Just A Story;10;2;"A couple were video calling each other late at night. It had been 2 weeks since their last call. They had a lot to say to each other, they talked for 3 hours before the wife Jen asked the husband Mark to say a horror story. Horror stories were Mark's specialty. He could create one in an instant, they were some of the best Jen had ever heard. Horror was Jen's most favourite genre. So Mark started saying one. This story was a psychological horror. He talked about a person who wore a patchwork Cloth bag on his head and loved to torture his victims, he didn't even care if his victims escaped. Torture was his ultimate goal. He didn't want them to die quick, he wanted them to suffer as much as they could.  He paralyzes the victims neck down, ridding them of any movement. He then proceeds to take a toothpick and stab it through the eyelids. He loved hearing them scream in pain. After both the eyelids were done. This killer stabs the victims eyes, not the iris but the white part. This inflicted pain but was not very fatal. Most people would give up from the pain by now. But some people's bodies won't. They go through the entire thing. Once he is done with the eyes and if the victim is still alive. He would move onto their teeth, he would take a plier that has been sitting and collecting rust for many years now. He would put it up to their teeth and start humming. And then... He pulls. The person screams in pain. But no one can hear anything as they are in the middle of nowhere. Once the screaming subsides, he puts the plier onto another teeth and starts humming again. and then... Pulls again. When Mark showed the action of pulling, the lights went out. Jen was surprised. Mark said ""I definitely meant for that to happen"". He goes and checks what happened and figures out the problem, repairs it and comes back. As he sits down, a figure with a patchwork Cloth bag on its head rise up from behind the bed.";16199247560
Wedding Video Confession;207;11;"Candace and I had just returned home from our Honeymoon. The DVD was in the mailbox, footage from our wedding a few weeks prior. We had a little over a hundred guests for our wedding, which took place in our backyard. The videographer we hired had staged an interview area in our living room for guests to give shout-outs, crack jokes, and partake in the usual wedding bliss antics you expect from family and friends. 

I popped the DVD into the player, as Candace and I snuggled up on the couch to watch the footage. At one point during the interviews, a woman appeared that we did not recognize.

“So, what do you have to say to the Bride and Groom?” the videographer asked her.

“Brett is just a dream of a man, isn’t he? I’m just a little jealous of Candace. I wish I were in her shoes. If I can’t have him, neither can she.” The woman smirked and cackled loudly. “I’m kidding, kind of.”

“So, how do you know the couple?” 

“We’ve been close for years. I guess you can say I am a neighbor of sorts. I mean, I practically know how long Brett brushes his teeth for. Thirty-seven seconds on average.”

The footage cut to the next person. I paused it when Candace looked over at me, fuming.

“Who was that bitch? Do you know her?” she asked.

“No clue, but that’s creepy as hell. I don’t even remember seeing her at the wedding at any point. Do you?” I responded.

“Nope, but maybe she came with one of our friends. I’ll ask around.”

The next morning, Candace kissed me on the cheek and headed out for her early morning jog. About an hour later, a loud thud woke me up. I ran into the kitchen and noticed a glass of orange juiced spilled out on the ground. The front door of the house was open. I rushed outside and the woman, that woman, was loading Candace’s body into a white minivan.

I tackled her before she could get into the driver seat and speed off. While keeping her restrained, I managed to dial the cops. The woman was arrested, and luckily Candace recovered shortly after even though she had been drugged.

The cops did a sweep of the house and found tiny cameras in our bathroom and bedroom. But that’s not the worst of it. The deranged woman confessed to hiding in our attic from time to time. During the flood of news reports that emerged in the following days, the news anchors referred to her as the Wedding Crasher Carver.

Investigators found a home filled with half a dozen dead bodies; all of them were women recently married. The victim’s faces had been sliced off. On top of their mangled remains of a face, plaster gauze mask molds of the killer’s smiling face.";16198576620
What on earth am I doing?;4;1;"
What the fuck am I doing? Piling living bodies on top of one and another and even hearing them moan a little due to the pain. Then going home to have a meal and then bed to only just get up again and repeat the process, which is piling up living bodies on top on each other again who feel pain and emotion. What on earth am I doing? What the fuck am I doing?! All for just minimum wage. I don’t want to do this anymore and I know that is how I feel but I keep coming back to this work and I keep asking myself what the fuck am I doing? Why am I doing this every single day with only 1 day off?  

 

What the fuck am I doing man and to be honest I don’t what I am doing, I never know what I am doing I’m just flowing through it all and all of the motions of life. My father never knew what he was doing and he was just figuring out and going along. Man what am I doing now burning living bodies, their screams wrecking my ears and my managers won’t provide ear plugs. Probably get tinnitus one day. Fuck this shit I should just walk out of this back breaking work, I mean have you ever carried a living body that wasn’t holding its own weight?  

 

Whenever I see a door open I just say to myself to just walk out and when I don’t, I shout to myself in my mind “what the fuck am I doing! What the fuck am I doing here! Fuck man what am I doing!” and the process starts again in another day. I am better than this and I don’t need to do this but here I am every single day, I am here early in the morning and late at night. What on earth is going on with my life? I am so lost and I don’t know where to go or who to ask for help. I don’t what I’m doing and I wish I knew what I was doing for once in my life.  

 

Or for crying out loud what is this again, what am I doing here dealing with this kind of crap. A living body of a child crawling its way out into freedom. I forcefully force myself to catch up to the crawling body of a child. The child stops crawling and then I stop and I say to myself “what am I fucking doing here doing this kind of shit work for shit pay. Hard work”  

 

The tree says to me “let the boy die and his body can feed the environment” and then squirrels start singing my name and were dancing for me. I simply think to myself “what the fuck is going on? What am I doing? What is my life talking to a tree with dancing squirrels with a body of a boy crawling?”";16199268090

The Chute;88;7;"Ramon slowly regained consciousness; all around was darkness. He felt manacles on his hands and arms; though standing, he was pressed onto a rigid, curved surface. A cacophany of metal sounds roared as he was jolted upwards; a few seconds later, it stopped. He heard the echoes die down, then seconds later, it repeated; more loud noises, and another abrupt yank upwards.

As his eyes got used to the dim light, he could see another track to his left. It consisted of manacles and full body-sized seats, like his, but they were empty. Every time his track jerked forward, that one, with a short random delay, would move in the other direction. Ramon groaned; it was like the safety harness on a macabre ride in the world's worst amusement park.

The light intensified slightly as he continued to rise, and the wall to his right ended. Across the way, he could see Carlos, one of the other prisoners. The noise made it difficult to communicate, but after expressing some confusion about how they got here, they both recalled being ordered to hold onto the steel bars of their cell, then feeling a sudden burst of electricity surge through them. Neither had any idea where they were.

Finally they reached the roof. Ramon could see past the back of the seat in front of him; he realized they were all occupied, as were the ones in Carlos' line. Solar panels covered the vast majority of the roof. It seemed their seats were slowly being taken over the edge of the roof, only to return empty. Ramon swallowed hard and tried to see what was going on.

As he neared the roof's edge, he could see the ground. There was a large crowd of cheering people, holding signs such as ""The wages of sin"", ""It's about time"", and ""God hates criminals"". They were quite far away -- the building was at least twelve stories high -- but Ramon felt some of them were looking directly at him, making mocking expressions and vulgar gestures. Through the din, he thought he could hear a terrified shriek, an instant after a loud banging sound, before the line moved forward again.

As he passed the roof's edge, he could see below him. There was a large metal box, the size of a standard shipping container, standing on its end, its top open. Leading into it was a sturdy-looking metal chute, open at the top. He gaped as he saw a body fall towards it, hit with a sickening thud, then slide into the container. This was a mass execution! He realized that such a fall was probably the cheapest way to kill someone. Glumly, he realized that, with all the solar panels, it was probably also the greenest method.

He reached the head of the line. Time froze for an instant. In a single motion, his manacles released and his seat pushed him forward. He watched the metal chute rush up to him. He didn't bother to scream.";16198676640
Empress of Mankind;951;51;"“You’re going in my book,” Bella said sourly, producing from her backpack an old and tattered notebook. “And you too.”

She was pointing at Bird Flogger and Jackson, ignoring me completely, and for some reason this fact sent shivers down my spine. They hadn’t really done anything either, always the spineless sycophants those two. I was the head honcho around here. They were merely henchmen.

“Yeah so?” I said. “*Bella Bella, looks like Stella*,” I teased.

Now this particular rhyme made absolutely no sense, unless of course you were familiar with Stella. Or, *Stella Stella, looks like a fella*, I should say. Kids you know. Heartless fucking monsters.  


“Oh, you’ll see,” Bella said, a sly smile finding its way in between the bruises and swellings. “You’ll see.”

For some reason I believed her, but I couldn’t acknowledge that. I wasn’t no coward. Bullying defenseless kids half my size was my jive, and about the only reason anyone would ever talk to me. So I punched her in the face hard enough to knock out one of her molars, and left her sobbing on the ground spitting out blood. 

“You’ll see!” Bella yelled after me.

And I did. Took me a few days though, I wasn’t the sharpest shoe in the shed, but I soon came to realise something was...off.

“Bella,” I whispered, pulling her into the boy’s bathroom the next day. “What the frick did you do?!”

“You shall address me as Empress henceforth,” she said matter-of-factly.

“What?”

“Empress of Mankind.”

“What?!”

“Or else I’ll do the same to you.”

That’s all she needed to say. I lost my cool, a trembling lower lip soon spreading to a full on breakdown, and I bawled my eyes out like the insecure little asshole I was. 

“I swear,” I sniffled. “I’ll never hurt you again.”

“You’ll never hurt me again…?” she murmured idly.

“Empress,” I whispered. “I’ll never hurt you again, Empress of Mankind.”

“Splendid,” she said, patting me on the head like I was a dog. “Now go do my bidding.”

And that’s my story. That’s how I know the Empress of Mankind. She had me under her heel all through middle and high school, before she disappeared on the Day of the First, which is a load of crap by the way. They weren’t the first. They were just the first to be *noticed*.

*What do you mean?*

I told you about Bird Flogger and Jackson, yeah? *They* were the first. It was my punishment, you see. To take them away from me. To take them away from everything.

*You mean...*

She wiped them from existence. Literally. Their entire bloodline, ancestry, gone, poof, like they were never here to begin with. I’m the only one that ever knew of them. Everyone else...forgot.

*And where is she now?*

Haven’t the foggiest, uh, agent? Detective? But I know one thing.

*What’s that?*

You guys pissed her off. And she doesn’t respond well to your kind.

*And what kind is that?*

Bullies.";16198129410
My Mum Is Crazy;11;0;"My mum and I live together on our own in a small house out in the country. My dad left us when I was 5 and my mum hasn’t been the same since. My dad was seriously abusive to my mum and I and it made me think that his abandonment would be a good thing, but it sent my mum down a dark spiral. 

It started with her memory. She would tell me that I shouldn’t be leaving the house late at night and I should stop swapping things around in the cupboard. I passed these things off as she was clearly struggling and wasn’t thinking straight.

Then things started to get worse. She was convinced that I was the reason our Dad left us and would take it out on me at every moment she could. She started becoming cold and callous. Her face was gaunt which made her hauntingly pale. It was like living with a ghost. 

One night she got so paranoid I was genuinely fearing for my life. The shadows of her legs were at the bottom of my door. I called out for her, mainly to reassure myself it was actually her. No answer. I sat and watched as the shadow of her legs paced outside my door, as if she were waiting for me to leave.

I couldn’t bare it anymore. I had to leave that house and get as far away as possible. But if I leave she will call the Police. Do I want the Police skulking around the apple tree ? He’s under there but the dirt is still fairly fresh after the addition of others who have crossed me. If Mum carries on she’ll be added to my collection.";16198903970
Living With Them;34;1;"I’ve lived with them a long time now. 

&#x200B;

*“Now listen, there’s some things that I have to tell you, some things you best learn from me and not go finding out on your own,”* my mother explained to me when I was a boy, *“We don’t live in no ordinary house, you see?”*

&#x200B;

I had felt it, there was an undeniable presence there with us, something that stayed just out of sight.

&#x200B;

*“These walls have seen a lot of things, felt a lot of different emotions. Sometimes people leave things behind, little pieces of themselves. You’ll see them from time to time, they mean you no harm.”*

&#x200B;

From that day on I tried my hardest to live with the dark figures that were always moving in my peripherals. Like she promised, after a while their presence no longer scared me.

&#x200B;

When I grew older, my mother’s health started to suffer. One evening, as we sat by the fire she decided to tell me more about the house.

&#x200B;

“I was pregnant when we moved here... and you know, we weren’t really savvy enough to realize there had to be a catch, had to be a reason it sold for so little. Well, we learned right away there was... something here with us,” she said, keeping her eyes on the flames, “We'd see them, spirits, I mean. Didn't know what to do, we couldn't just leave, you see? Well, we did some digging, wanted to learn some more about the house... Heard a rumor the man who used to live here was a killer.""

&#x200B;

I let out a gasp, she simply nodded.

&#x200B;

""People would go missing near our land. Just disappear...  After he died lawmen came looking up here. They never found nothing... But I did. Went rooting around in the cellar one day and found a hidden room full of jars. Dozens of them. Pieces of people floating inside the glass.""

&#x200B;

Bile rose in my throat and I felt faint, yet she continued.

&#x200B;

""Didn't know what to do, couldn't bring myself to get rid of them. Never told your father. Never found the right time. Never had the time either, he passed away in his sleep soon after,” she grabbed my hand tightly, her eyes brimmed with tears, ""He never got to meet you. The more I thought on it, the more it ate me up inside. I just couldn't live with it. I thought of all the spirits lingering in the house... All those little pieces left behind... I realized there was still a way for him to be with you."" 

&#x200B;

She pulled me closer, the flames cast ominous shadows over her face.

&#x200B;

""I don't have much time left. When I pass, you must promise me something. There's a place for me. In the cellar, on the shelf beside your father. You'll recognize him, you've got his eyes. Will you put my jar there? Can you do that for me, son, will you keep us here with you?""";16198625650
To Move Our Family;79;8;"She was exuberant when she came home that day. In the living room she screamed, “I’m pregnant!” I pinched my eyes closed and drew a long sigh. This was not what I wanted, not at all. But I forced a smile and tried to at least be happy for her. She traipsed around all day while I contemplated what I should do about this. I was up for a promotion and had planned on taking her with me, but I hadn’t planned on having to prepare for a child as well. I didn’t know if it would fit.

As she freshened up the house, I started making inquiries to the contractors building our home. Because the place was in Europe it had to be built to exact dimensions and also go through a laborious process to get permission. I sent the message and then sat back watching her cut flowers and place them around the house.

My email notification dinged at the same time as the doorbell and while she ran from the bedroom where she was fluffing the pillows to answer the door, I read the response:

Dear Mr Granger

Resubmitting for a new building permit at this time would be very disadvantageous. My company and I would have to stop building now and wait twelve weeks for the new permit to arrive. We also run the risk of the permit being denied (I doubt very highly that it would, however). And the additional costs would also have to be changed, so we would have to create a new estimate. However, may I remind you that the building you have designed is symmetrical and that, while not intended as part of the original build, there is another space which exists that could also be used. My suggestion is that we proceed with the project as planned, but instead of blocking off that area, we use that. This would be an acceptable change which would require minor tweaking.

Please let us know what you think about this solution.

Sincerely

Willhelm Deinherz

Damn. He was right. That would work. This could work out after all. 

“Heyyyy, lady!” I heard and looked back. Great, Mark’s sister Tessa was at the door. She was such fucking bitch. 

“Whatcha doing?” she asked with that syrupy voice. She was the kind of girl that when she wanted something she broke out her cutesy voice. You know the one that girl’s use when they need you to do something. That’s basic female manipulation 101. 

While she was there, I busied myself with making sure that we had the right containers for the transport. I had to add an extra one. Everything was going by ship. It was easier that way.

That’s when I heard the squeal, “Ohhhh my GOD!!!!” And watched them hug and dance for joy.

“Has Mark said anything yet?” Tessa asked.

“I haven’t told him. He’s not home, yet,” she replied.

Turning off the spy-cam, I thought, *We all will be soon enough.*";16198465620
My daddy is an artist;77;14;My daddy is an artist, he liked to paint on mummy. Mummy used to hate it but she doesn’t move anymore. Daddy’s paints are magic, they’re blueish and brown when it’s fresh, but after a day it turns purple and black. My daddy paints mummy when he’s angry. Somedays he has his silly drink and paints mummy for fun. He wanted to paint me but mummy stopped him. Today I spilt water on daddy’s phone. He got angry and wanted to paint on me. Mummy wasn’t home to stop him. He made me take off all my clothes. He even ripped my dress. He didn’t use a paintbrush, and I didn’t see any paints on his hands. It hurt when he painted on my tummy, it hurt my chest and legs too. He liked to paint my legs. I asked daddy to stop but he said it’s what I needed. He says that about broccoli and vegetables, so maybe he’s right. Daddy tells me to be more careful next time. My skin is painted. It’s beautiful like art.;16198455760
Granny's Camera;33;3;"The first time I learned about a camera obscura was when I went into this ole abandoned theater.  It was this big old hall, you know, kinda empty and echoey and stuff.  There was mildew here and there and I kept sneezing due to it, but the ceiling was one of them rounded deals with a bump in the middle.  Kinda looked like a giant, moldy boob if you looked at it at the right angle.

Well, there was this pinprick in the top of the boob.  Bigger than a real pinprick mind you. A hole.   And along the ceiling was a picture of outside and I sat there in the damp theater seats staring up at that image for a good long while.   You know, kinda gawking.  I saw Billy Thumpkin digging into his nose while he crossed the road.  Damn near got hit by Mr Hawling's big caddillac too.  But he made it and I just sat there watching the whole ordeal from the comfort of the hall.   I was so taken by the thing, I decided right then and there to try and make my own, cause you know, something ain’t yours unless you steal it and make it yours.  That’s what my old pappy used to say.

So, I went home and started poking holes in things and then looking in em to see if I could see the world.  The first thing was a cardboard shoe box.  It took a little figuring out.  I like to tinker.  Tinkering’s my thing and all.  But when I finally saw that image, I thought Damn.  The world looks all cardboard like.  That got me thinking.  What a world looks like inside of other things.  I heard my cat mewling and thought I’d give that a try.  But cat’s are wild critters.  Ornery and wicked.  She scratched my lips bloody when I poked a hole in her fur and I knew I’d have to use something more docile.  Something calmer that wouldn’t hurt me.

So, at night I grabbed the shovel from the shed and went digging.  Luckily, we hadn’t buried grandma that deep.  The town always charges you for the depth you bury your loved ones and we didn’t have no money, so she was basically just thrown on the ground and we let nature cover her up.  That was about ten years ago, so I had to dig a little, but not enough to even break a sweat.  And there she was just bones and bits and pieces of her nightgown.  I dusted off her skull and got to working.

Soon, I was staring into grandma’s skull trying to see the sunrise.  Took me a while and all.  At first,  I saw only darkness, but then a picture came into view slowly.  I saw granny’s grave and all her bones.  Only thing was, her bones were reassembling themselves and soon her bony hand began reaching for me and I heard her whisper, “Gimme that back!”";16198586300
Thanatophobia, Chronophobia;78;4;"When I was younger, I was always immensely fearful of my own mortality. It was a lingering feeling of dread constantly at the back of my mind. I was afraid of dying, of leaving this mortal plane with nothing to show for my time here. 

I could barely enjoy anything, without feeling as if there was something better I could be doing with my brief time- while having no clue as to what I'd do instead- if that makes sense. 

I have lived hundreds of lives now. 

A criminal, a noble, a wife, a daughter, a mistress, and a multitude more. 

At the end of each life, death would come; wave its tired, gnarled hand at me and tell me it's time to go. I'd beg, scream. I'd cling to its sleeve each time and tell it to give me another life. I must have been an amusing case to it since each time it would accept. It would watch the calm envelop me, before wagging its long finger at me and extending its hand: asking for payment. 

Each time I would happily give up a future family member's life, being reborn again as whichever poor descendent I had stolen the life from this time. 

Eventually, death must have grown tired of my games, when after my thousandth or so life, there was no amount of begging and screaming that would change its mind. Death dropped me in the eagerly waiting hands of a villainous, bitter, being who has been content on simply holding me in a kind of make-shift purgatory, forcing me to watch life continue on without me. 

All the while the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of little whiny voices circle around me, shaming me for taking their lives and replacing them with my own. ";16198405470
He could never get the nose quite right.;13;3;"“He could never get the nose quite right.” The minister remarked, standing over the casket. 

Looking at its contents, I was able to intuit what this statement meant. The minister turned to me and continued: 

“Jay fought valiantly for our country, don’t forget that. This was just one of the sacrifices he had to make.”

In passing, I had always noticed the irregularities, I had just never inquired on their nature. Now, however, the answers to those questions lay bare.

“The War to End All Wars took a toll on all of us. Jay was a good soldier.”

The receptacle began to close, its lid grinding against the hawthorn wood. Once its advance halted, they smothered the military sarcophagus with its proper flag. 

Jay was a good soldier, but now Jay was just a soldier.

I asked the minister who undertook the task of repairing Jay. 

“Why, the handiwork’s none other than that fine gentlemen over there, Dr. Harolds. He’d served in the armed forces for years, then he came back to help those on the front lines after his tenure. He’s seen all of the faces of war.”

Upon pressing the doctor, he revealed:

“Yes, we crafted them with the finest military-grade plastics. He was an early case, so we lacked some experience crafting plates. The rest of our military eventually improved our facial prosthetics. He walked with our faces, produced by the great American war engine. It’s beautiful, what us people can do if we put ourselves together to work towards a goal.”

He sat there with an abstruse pause, as if there was more.

I waited. 

“The thing is, with his prosthetic, it was always a bit obvious that he had come from the military. Every one of his interactions was overshadowed by…”

I waited for his continuation. 

“Well, let me just put it this way-”

He continued. 

“We could never get the nose quite right.”";16198688180

Ah, spring;18;2;"So I stopped and smelled the roses and the goddamned thing bit me. I'm going to assume I'm being litteral calling it god damned. Some god damned it. However I'm not litteral about it being a rose...I actually stopped and smelled the daffodils. Regardless of species *the son of a bitch bit me.*

""God dammit!"" I shouted, followed by a muttered ""Garbage bag"" while stepping on it. 

And it bit me again, right through my shoe. Like, bitemarks on my toes right through my shoe. Workboots to be precise. 

Of course, I screamed and ripped off my shoe. As I pulled the sock half my toe ripped off, causing, beleive it or not, a louder scream. One of those high pitched 'was that *me* making that sound??' screams. 

On the ground I stared at the yellow daffodil in disbelief as I took my phone out to call 911. Blood was straight up gushing and I wasn't going to be able to hop anywhere what with the intense pain and all. 

My hands were shaking and heart was hammering as I opened up the phone app. I clenched my eyes shut trying to block out how both confused and hurt I was, and as soon as I did the phone was slapped out of my hand. Hard. I opened my eyes and saw I had a deep papercut-like slit from the middle of my thumb and forefinger all the way across the top of my hand. 

Looking at the daffodil I saw blood covering the edge of its leaves. My eyes were drawn back over to the flowers center and there I saw an eye. This angry hazel eye staring at me, the petals forming a menacing eyebrow of sorts. It maintained eye contact and I felt my hand go to my foot and yank the toe off. 

I felt my hand do this...I absolutely did NOT make the conscious decision to do so. 

It took a couple yanks and I yelled and I pulled and I screamed and it released. And then I tossed my toe at the daffodil and the fucking eye had a mouth in the middle that showed itself as my toe sailed over to it. My toe was consumed by the mouth in the eye in the flower. 

Have you ever seen an eyeball *chew* before? 

HAVE YOU? 

My toe blood ran down the petals as the eye angrily glared at me, chewing. 

And then... it was gone. No eye, just a simple yellow flower glistening with my blood.";16198587480
Paranoid Woman and a Lost Job;14;1;"I think there’s a tiny camera in my bag. It’s transmitting my every action to someone else and they’re sending people to follow me. I know how crazy that sounds. Just writing it out, it sounds absolutely, positively, loony bonkers. 

Everything was fine, absolutely fine. Then, on a Thursday, I was “laid off” from my job. On a Thursday, not a Friday, no a Thursday. I think that means something. I can’t believe they got rid of my position and didn’t keep me. I was an associate manager. I was climbing the ranks. I was beloved and adored. I never called in. I never missed a day.

But goodbye, see you later, and good night! 

Ever since that day, I’ve had the weirdest feeling, like someone is watching me no matter what I do. It was like the stage lights turned on somewhere, and everyone was wondering what I’d do next. But like, before any of this, I didn’t even know there was a stage. I hadn’t been clued in to their expectations. 

And they’re sending people. Strange people. With messages. For example, without warning, this man came up to me at the park and told me he liked my bag and winked. 

He winked. 

What am I supposed to do with that? I’d hate to part with the bag, but here we are again, with another bucket of worldly conundrums. 

The worst thing is at night. The scratching is getting worse. 

At first, I just scratched a little. But now, I wake up and I’m covered and bruises and deep, long, dragging scratches. I don’t know what’s doing it. I thought maybe I could get a cat and the cat could scratch whatever was scratching me. Some of the wounds have brown flecks in them, like rust, like someone’s been dragging rusty nails all over my arms, legs, hands, and face. I look like I’m constantly covered in lines, like I’ve been fighting with a screwdriver. 

I really thought it was me. Maybe it was some kind of night allergy. Now, I’m not so sure.

I look at the walls of my apartment and they don’t look like my walls anymore. 

My area manager who fired me, he was at once so nice and calm. When he rid the company of me, he was cold, stale, rigid, and metallic. Maybe it wasn’t actually him. Maybe they replaced him. 

What am I supposed to do now? What more can I do?

I guess I’m going to get rid of the bag, but I wonder, what will they do next? Send someone or something worse to follow me? Maybe I shouldn’t go home tonight. Maybe I should sleep in the woods out behind my building. Maybe I could watch my windows from the front seat of my car. 

Maybe, it’s all just in my head.";16198651780
The veterinarian;83;8;"The police had gotten a call for howling at 156 palm Street. That happened to be a warehouse. When they got in it was dark and quiet. That was normal. They heard a whimper in the darkness. 

They followed the wretched sound to a cage, where the whimpers went into growls and then a bark. They shined the light into the cage to see a man. Pale and malnourished. He looked them in the eyes with dear and let out a low growl. They asked him why and he didn't answer, only growled more. When they went to open the cage he stopped, then proceeded to crawl out. He motioned towards the corner, still on his hands and knees. They turned on the lights.

The lights brought the many cages to light. Some normal men and women and some dogs. It was horrifying. The people were hairy, and the dogs looked of patchwork. There was a door, which they went to open. They were already on their toes with horror. What they saw was worse than anything they could have expected.

There was what looked like an Ed Gein creation. It walked on its 4 legs, but it wasn't natural. It had the body structure of a dog but had skin stretched over it. It did not look like a shaved dog, it looked like it was born that way. It had human eyes and looked frail. What was in the corner was potentially worse. It was a person on their hands and knees, covered in golden fur with dark beady eyes. It looked at them. The human hands and feet covered in golden fur was off-putting. It was unnatural but so well done.

They put together a theory. Someone was breeding dogs and people and these were the epitome. The pinnacle.

How would they bust whoever this is or was? What will they do with the poor animals and people? What would the culprit do with the two police that were in there if they found them?

And most importantly, what if these creatures are released into the wild?";16198190850
The human caterpillar;6;3;"It wasn't so long ago that he was soundly asleep in his little cacoon. He woke 2 weeks later when his cacoon began to dethaw. 

It took him a few minutes to get used to his metamorphosis. Sure he was disgusting but he was our abomination.

With his legs sew together like a braid. 4 of his ribs penetrating through his body as his legs. Two big beautiful starting from his spine and it is so thin you can see the veins in it, and his eyes were like two long sticks sticking out of his eye sockets.

He began to scream out loud, and struggling to walk. Let alone being able carry himself as his wings being drag on the ground, and throwing out this red mucus that smells like old blood and a corpes decaying.

He isn't perfect, but soon the human caterpillar will be perfect, and then we can expand our wings so the whole world see what we have created.

He only has 2 days to live or earlier, but I hope he dies sometime soon because I cant look at him anymore, because it hurts me seeing my brother like this, and thinking at we have the same blood disgusts me.

My Little Girl;1987;121;"She was always my little girl.

My last born, she was the baby of the family. Everyone watched out for her, and no-one more than me. I held her when she cried after bullies targeted her, I held her when she was stressed about her exams. I made her favourite dinner when she seemed down. Watched her favourite shows with her to spend time with her.

When she went to her first day at school I cried, just as I cried when she went to university for the first time. We helped her bring everything up to her room, helped her unpack, took her shopping. Managed to hold my tears until I got back to the car, and I cried so hard that my ribs hurt. My heart hurt. My little girl.

I remember when she brought him home for the first time. I didn't like him from the get-go. His attitude, how he looked at her. How when she was on her phone he looked to see who she was texting. I didn't like him. A mother's instinct, a woman's instinct, basic animal reaction to a threat, I don't know. But I felt it, I knew.

She got in touch less and less. Her excuses were flimsy, fraught with fear. I could hear it, but didn't want to intrude. Didn't want to give him a reason for her to not talk to me at all. I should have pushed the matter, I should have asked. But I didn't. I didn't. And now I live with that. My little girl.

I remember the hospital calling, the desperate dash to her. Being allowed in to her room and smelling that sickly sweet and cloying petrol. The barbecue he made of her; burnt and rotting meat. I remember looking at her face, thinking something was wrong. Her ears and her nose were gone. Burnt off. Smoldering in the flat I gave her the deposit money for. Her beautiful hair, that I would brush 100 times a night, that I would braid and plait and style for her as a young girl and, later, help her with more complicated styles for school to impress. 

I tried to hold her hand, but when I touched her fingers they were wet and sticky to the touch, yet rough and coarse. My hand recoiled, instinctively, and my heart broke. We spoke to her, told her we loved her, and soon she was gone. My little girl.

I couldn't hold her as I had before, as now my daughter's body was merely evidence. She was no longer a person - the girl who loved Bratz and adored her dog, asking for pictures of him whenever she was homesick. She was proof for a prosecution.

No evidence, they said. Not enough for prosecution, they told me. But I knew. A mother knows. He admitted it, eventually, after the 7th fingernail and the fourth tooth. Once he was dead, I cut away his nose and his ears. Pity he died before I did. As I left the room, I looked back at him.

'For my little girl'.";16197477480
The Penitent / Romans 7:20;23;8;"The Penitent approaches the confessional box.

His steps are light, wary. The steps of a young man. They falter, retreat a little, falter again, then come closer. I know the footsteps of every member of my congregation, but I don’t recognize these steps. I must remember to be nice, to not scare him away. I must be a good ambassador for God.

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I confess… ” he trails off. “Sometimes I doubt in God.”

Ah, a doubter. It happens to everyone at some point. “Do not feel ashamed. Pray for His guidance and look for Him in the little things. Notice Him in the innocent laugh of a child, in the rough bark of a tree, in each drop of rain. You will see that God is everywhere.”

“Father, sometimes I hurt people, even though I don’t want to.”

Time to quote The Book. “I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep doing. That’s Romans 7:18-19. You see, even devoted apostles like Paul sinned and did things they knew were bad. You must pray for forgiveness with all your heart, and God will forgive you.”

There’s a pause. “Sometimes I even murder.”

Suddenly I feel trapped in this box. I don’t feel like an ambassador for God anymore. I feel like a prisoner.

“Well… um…” I clear my throat. “Of course you must ask God for forgiveness, but, uh, the secular law is important too. I would, uh, highly recommend you to speak to the, uh, police.”

“And if I don’t want to?” His tone has changed. “You wouldn’t dare break the seal of the confessional, would you?”

“Uh…” I freeze for a moment. “No, of course not!” Damn. I hesitated too long. He noticed.

The second he takes to respond feels like a lifetime. “Well, that’s what the last priest said, and *he* sure as hell didn’t keep *his* promise.”

“I’m not like that priest! I swear, I’d never tell anyone but God!”

“Would you rather die than break that promise?” He yanks open the door of the box and pulls out a knife, shiny as a polished mirror. He inspects it carefully, runs his forefinger gently along the edge. He holds up a bleeding finger for me to see, then gestures to the space around us. “You say God is everywhere. Do you see God here? Will He save you?”

I try to appeal to him. “There’s still time to be forgiven. If you repent, God will take you back! Don’t condemn yourself to the flames below!”

He cocks his head slightly. “Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. That’s Romans 7:20.” He smiles and thrusts the knife forward.";16198342130
Afterwards;50;1;"When Harold's wife died he was so distraught that he ran up and down the stairs for hours at a time trying to give himself a heart attack. Peter Cushing did exactly the same thing when his wife passed and, like Harold, failed in his aim.

Coming to his senses, he collapsed on the stairs and cried, embarrassed with himself. He couldn't do it. He was too weak.

His daughter came to stay with him for a few days to keep him company. They walked along the beach, watched inane Saturday night TV and tried to laugh as best they could.

When she left, the life of the house went also. Harold was attacked by the silence and he turned the TV on in defence, comforted by the chatter of strangers.

The evenings were the worst. The world drew quiet and he would often fall asleep to both the radio and TV.

When the tranquility was banished each morning, he felt a dewdrop of happiness. Grief was an awful companion and the hearing of humanity going about its business felt taunting.

Harold was at that place in life where the disappointment of not living up to his youthful expectations were substituted with calm indifference. He was lonely though. His wife's death was sudden and he relied on her a lot.

He took the bus into town to go shopping but it wasn't pleasurable any more. Too many boarded-up shops, too many charity shops. Everyone dressed like tramps, vaping and swearing. After dawdling around Poundland and Primark he went home.

That evening, as the cacophony of the day settled into an evening hum, he decided on a coastal walk.

On Sunday Harold visited Agnes' grave. It had been vandalised, the flowers trampled and his small gifts stolen. He didn't want to let her down so tidied the area.

Arriving home he noticed the front door was open. Stepping inside he met a teenager, masked and clearly burgling his house.

""Out of the way, wanker!"" The kid shouted. Harold backed away. The burglar mocked him.

""Brave cunt aren't you?""

""No, he's not.""

The dainty voice surprised the intruder. He turned around to see a beautiful old woman, ethereal and unholy. She placed a shimmering, ghostly bag over the boy and laughed as he shrieked, the crushing bag slowly shrinking until it became small and bloody.
 
""Agnes?"" Harold mumbled in horror.

""You couldn't even defend our home, Harold! You're fucking useless!""

He became frightened when she spoke to him like that and started trembling.

Agnes saw the fear in Harold and started to beat him. He begged her to stop.

""I'll teach you how to be a real man! It's obvious you can't survive without me!""

She had always been cruel. Harold shuddered as she punched and kicked him, but Agnes was his wife and he had taken an oath to love her always.

As the wind closed the front door shut, the house resounded once again with the noise of Harold screaming.";16198054240
The Best Intentions;10;1;"""We...we were not aware of the possible consequences, Comrade."" said the Chairman of the Politburo.

""I assure you, that we had the best intentions, Sir."" said the President.

God sighed, leaned forwards in his chair and stared at them incredulously. ""Not aware of the consequences."" he echoed, pressing the words out between clenched teeth  ""Only had the best intentions. You just *blew up* an essential part of my creation! You obliterated an entire planet! You killed trillions of living beings! And all you have got to say about the matter is: We had the best intentions?!""

""I..."" said the Chairman of the Politburo.

""You..."" said the President.

God shut them up with a small gesture of his hand. He stood up straight, his brow furrowed, and his eyes began to shine with a wild, unearthly fire. For one moment, he was once again the God of the Patriarchs, who had stopped the sun over Mount Gibeon and empowered Samson. The men in front of him suddenly felt as small as ants and cowered down, fully expecting to be smitten by thunderbolts at every moment. However, the storm that seemed to be on the horizon never broke. When, after several minutes, they dared to look up again, they found that the creator of the universe sat in his bent-over position again. He suddenly looked small, old and frail. The President opened his mouth, but felt that he was unable to say anything. 

""Nevermind."" said God tonelessly ""I should have seen it coming, in my so-called unending wisdom. Everyone who has been sent to my office in the last thousand years has always had the best intentions. Its just is a phrase that rubs me the wrong way for some reason. Go to hell now, you two. I have work to do."" 

The two leaders possibly wanted to say something else, but within the Microsecond they had already been transported from the room.

God sighed deeply and enjoyed the silence for a moment. Then he picked up a document from his desk and began reading. The document was the first of several billion application letters for places in the heavenly host that he had received this morning. It began with the words: ""Dear God! I have always had the best intentions..."".";16198355620
Live Life In The Dead Lane;32;0;"I hadn't attended my local swimming centre in months, although I'd overheard people mentioning about how it's ""expanded"" and ""become something new"".

Well, that certainly wasn't a lie.

Last week when I showed up there was a lane for dead people. It wasn't sectioned away from the rest of the pool, instead it was directly next to the fast one. Of course, I was gobsmacked beyond all recognition - I stood there in my Speedos and gazed at the water, as a decapitated corpse leaked blood everywhere, and moved like a deranged fish, while another, immediately behind, was more like a spirit, a blur passing through the water.

Nobody else there seemed to acknowledge this ridiculousness.

I walked up to the lifeguard and queried this.

He said, ""Sir, would you like to try our dead lane?""

""Excuse me?""

""Would you like to experience our new dead lane?""

""I think I'll pass on that one,"" I replied.

""Are you sure?"" he asked. ""I think you'd fit right in.""

I frowned, unsure as to whether he was trying to make a fool of me.

Just to prove him wrong, I dipped my feet in (when all of the dead people were out of reach). I half expected one of them to turn around and enforce me to leave. But when they didn't I began to question what was going on.

""I'm not dead,"" I told myself.

""Join us! Join us!"" I heard faintly.

Fuck that, I thought, getting out immediately. It was about time I departed...

The lifeguard called after me right before I entered the changing rooms.

""Don't be so nervous,"" he replied.

I said nothing.

""You don't think your dead, do you?""

""Well figured big brains,"" I snapped.

""Allow me to show you then,"" he retorted, revealing a knife from the pocket of his shorts. I've no idea how the astounding long blade fitted in there.

He started towards me.

I backed away.

Half-naked, I charged towards the reception area, my feet almost slipping against the wet floor.

*Join us! Join us!*

The man was making ground on me, his breath was getting louder.

""I'm not dead!"" I screamed, as I raced through the reception.

Car.

Ignition.

*Screech*!

I was losing him. Nowhere to be seen.

Down some quiet roads I travelled. Surely I was safe here among these blissful fields.

When I pulled over into a layby, that's when I was proven wrong.

A drip from the ceiling was followed by a slight dampness about my feet. Then water started coming in through the aircon vents, even when I tried to force them shut. The doors were jammed. The glass was unbreakable. The pedals weren't working. My car was filling up quickly.

Frantically I tried to get out.

*Join us! Join us!*

Do the dead feel fear?

As I went under I didn't try to fight it. I let the water take me.

Free of fear.

No longer dying.";16198134280
Trespassers will be shot;5;1;"
I always put warnings up to make sure that wannabe trespassers will be shot because I demand my own privacy and space. I hate those who trespass onto other people's lands and areas. It's an abomination and I hate those kinds of people because how dare they think that they could just wander into another person's space, I want those types of people to suffer for all eternity. It's everyone's right to protect themselves from trespassers and I take those rights to the extreme. Unfortunately my own family are those kinds of people that trespass into other people's spaces.

In my own bedroom I put a sign in front of my bedroom door which read 'trespassers will be shot' and when my little brother trespassed into my bedroom, MY BEDROOM!, I shot him instantly. The rage that I felt inside of me and in that moment when my little brother trespassed into my bedroom, we were not brothers anymore. We were now enemies and I shot him instantly but he should have read the warning sign that I had put in front of my bedroom door. I saw my brother as a stranger when he trespassed into my bedroom.

Then a couple of minutes later my father trespassed into my bedroom by rushing in probably because of the gun shot sound. I couldn't believe my own father ignored my warning sign to all trespassers. I shot my father as well and I mean can't people read? When my father rushed into my room when the sign clearly stated that trespassers will be shot, I was so ashamed of being his son. My own father's just like my little brother didn't care about trespassing into other people's spaces. They were both strangers to me they were both abominations.

I then needed to go to the toilet and when I put up my trespassing warning sign on the front door of the toilet, I hoped people would heed it. When my mother rushed into the toilet crying and screaming while I was doing my business, she was probably crying because of the two trespassers who trespassed into my bedroom, I shot her down because ignored the warning sign of what will happen to any trespassers. My own family were exactly like the people that I hated the most but like what most people say that just because someone is blood related, doesn't mean they are your family.

I hope my sister will need my warning sign in front of my bedroom when she comes homes from school.";16198362010
My Neighbor’s Axe;6;2;"Growing up in a tiny country town I’ve got to see my fair share of strange occurrences. Weirdness seem to come and go like the seasons, but one thing stays constant, the axe in my neighbor’s tree stump.

If you were from the City or just visiting for the first time, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was some kind of decoration piece. Something akin to a wood carving or yard art displayed in front of Sally’s house for tourists to see, but that axe is a reminder that we have a burden in this town. 

When Sally first was given that axe her grandparents tried to warn her. No one gets to leave the town. Her husband left to move away, and at the time she didn’t believe the stories either. She took it up in her hands let out some stress and fell that tree in her front yard. When her husband came home to kill her kids and her she took up the axe again. When the spirits sent him back two years later holding his head in his hands to try taking their lives again, the axe was waiting. 

My parents told me that story when they gave me an old rusty sledge. They told me some kind of evil has worked it’s way into this town. There is no leaving, well no leaving for good. You can sure try but you’ll come back crazed and looking for blood. After you’re put down or had your fill, your family will have to keep putting you down for generations. The old tools have some evil of their own. The blood and sweat of generations seems to be the only thing that’ll keep them down for long. 

I don’t have the boldness to leave my tool in the yard but Sally’s axe helps steel my resolve. I know my uncle and great-grandma will be coming soon. 

I know what I’ll have to do.";16198287940
The Caverns;7;0;"I fell. That's the last thing I remember, I fell from the edge of some kind of ravine, and then I woke up here. It was too dark to see anything, not even my own nose on my face. I fumbled for my box of matches and lit one, making the room brighter.

I managed to stand and find a way out of the room, into an even larger, darker area. I heard water running, and my own heavy breathing. I shouted out into the dark, ""Hello?!"", but I only heard an echo.

I kept moving and searching for a way out, and after climbing up a steep wall into a tunnel, I found a human skull. I immediately gagged, and started moving faster. Whatever killed that guy, I didn't want to run into it. 

I eventually found a river, so I followed it upstream. After a few minutes, I suddenly heard a loud thud, and the sound of an animal, no, some kind of monster, running towards me.

That's when I remembered something about the echoes from the large room.

The voice echoing back wasn't mine.";16198237140
Burn;13;0;"His mother looked at the notes, counted them again, and wiped her tears of gratitude with the palms of her hands.

His mother stretched her lips to a curve of a thankful smile and bid the man a grateful good-bye at the door. 

Under his mother's watchful eye, he  said his prayers and listened to what her mother said that day: We are good Christians and will always follow the Lord. This is why we need to ensure that we think of our neighbors.

As the youngest, he walked to the pyre and watched the flames lick at his feet, he thought he saw the Devil dance. Tonight was his last night as he looked into his mother's eyes and realized that they were the Devil's. 

As the flames singed his hair, the words were a jumble in his mind. Was it don't burn yourself to keep others warm, or burn yourself to keep others warm?

With a barely perceptible purr, the house cat, thought: This is desperation. 

She hushed up her kittens who sniffed the air of burning flesh, and purred into their ears: Patience.";16198122820
Wife's side of the bed;228;8;"My wife crawls into my bed every night at 3 am. 


Which would make sense if I didn’t drown her in a lake three years ago. 


She started coming in about a year after the anniversary of her death. At first I thought someone was breaking inside, and I threw up when I saw her corpse walking around our bedroom. 


She was rotten, moldy, and wet. An arm had fallen off, and little fish bites were scattered across her body. Her face was bloated, almost covering her rotten eyes up entirely. If they didn’t have a light green glow, you almost would think they weren’t there at all. 


I tried fighting against her. If I hit her, it just passes through, and she laughs it off. If she tries to grab me, though, she can do what she wants. If I fight back, she’ll knock me down, crawling onto her side of the bed, soaking the sheets with smelly lake water that lingers long after she vanishes with the sun. 


I’ve tried talking to her, telling her I’m sorry, even begging her to move on. She gurgles each time, vomiting up dirty lake water, before speaking in a broken, flooded voice. 


“Honey...please..” her voice sounds like it’s coming from far away, not next to my ear. “I’m so...cold...from the lake. Let me under... the covers.”


I can’t stop her, so under the covers she goes. I’ve tried staying at other places, hotels, friends houses, even camping in the woods. Not only does she find me every night, but nobody else can see her if I’m with other people, it’s as if she’s not there at all. I know that can’t be true; wherever she walks it leaves damp footprints behind, the blankets are soaked when I wake up, and she’s hit me enough times to know she’s real. 


The worst nights are when she’s angry. It’s rare, most nights she just wants to sleep, but some nights, maybe once a month, she’s furious with me. Once I woke up to her cold breath in my ear. “I’m freezing where.... I am, but it’s better… than burning... where you’re going.” I heard her lips part into a grin, and shivered under the blanket, trying to ignore the cold radiating off her body. 


I lost my mind, and finally, I confessed. I showed the police where I tied the anchor to her, and where she must have sank into the lake. They recovered her body, gave her a burial, and threw me in jail for life.


That was fine. Since she was put in the ground, my wife has left me alone. I still have nightmares, to the point where I got placed in solitary for a week.


I curled up alone on my muggy mattress, listening to the deafening silence around me. I’m disappointed, but not surprised, when I feel her wet body lean into me, soaking my dirty cell in lake smell. 


“Darling,” She croaked.";16197526720
World;12;5;"There is a world in existence, a world unlike any other. Access to this world is impossible anytime other than 2:20-2:22am. This world is like nothing you could have ever imagined, but be warned, there are simple but extremely important rules. 

Rule 1) Do not take photos. Photographs work differently here, and upon reflection you may find that things were not as they seemed when the photograph was taken. If you wish to remember this as a happy experience, it’s best not to take photos. 

Rule 2) Do not talk to the woman. If you see a woman with several heads you MUST ignore her and walk away from her until she is completely out of sight. This women is extremely dangerous and must not be spoken to.

Rule 3) Do not drink the pink stuff. The pink stuff is a warm, thick, hot pink liquid which smells of sweet sugary cupcakes. It is found in many of the small streams within this world, but you must never drink it. The pink stuff is extremely poisonous and will send you into a constant state of psychosis.

Rule 4) Make sure you keep track of time. Time is a very different concept here and if you do not keep track of it, time will warp into a void of emptiness and you won’t know how long you’ve been there or when you should leave.

Mirror Boy;30;2;"I have a secret – I met someone who looks exactly like me. He hides behind the mirror most days, so I call him mirror boy.

He showed up a few years back. We’ve been together ever since. Sometimes, when I look at my reflection, I see his eyes staring back at me. That’s how I know he doesn’t want to hide anymore. It’s his turn to be me. Soon – it could be hours, days, weeks, but inevitably, his hands would reach out from behind the glass and drag me into the mirror. And for a while, I would become the mirror boy.

From behind the mirror, I’d see him imitate me. He would smile and laugh and joke just like I would, and everyone around him – my friends, my family, would be none the wiser. He would glance at me from the other side and taunt me. He’d say, “how does no one notice I’m not you?”

Eventually I’d get strong enough to break the glass and cross back over. But I’ve been stuck for months now. Every now and then he stares at me from the other side, knowing I’m watching him. I try to reach out, but my hands only feel the cold of the mirror.";16197864900
Lily;867;33;"Lily was the most beautiful person I had ever met. Not in a physical way, although she had been quite pretty when we were younger. It was something about the way she laughed so genuinely, the way she helped without looking for something in return, the way she cared. I’d been friends with her since high school, so I knew everything there was to know about her. I knew she was afraid of heights, I knew her favorite cookies were chocolate chip cookies, I knew she always wore pink socks.

When Lily heard her husband’s diagnosis, she didn’t cry, didn’t scream. I thought she’d finally break down when we were alone together, but instead she complained about the squirrels digging up her carnations in the garden.

Of course, the diagnosis meant a lot of changes. Lily accepted her new responsibilities without complaint. She took care of her husband until the end. She never commented on his shriveling skin that hung in limp folds, didn’t mention the yellowing eyes that bulged unnaturally out of his skull and opened less and less as the weeks passed. She pretended not to see the way his clothes seemed to swallow him up, pretended not to hear the pathetic moans that emerged from the ever-enlarging hole of his mouth.

The worse he got, the more she fussed over her plants. “The orchids haven’t flowered in months. The magnolia tree is losing all its leaves. Those damned squirrels don’t let me plant anything new!” She would get herself worked up to the verge of tears.

When her husband passed, she refused to visit his grave. I thought that all she needed was time, that with time she would work her way from denial to acceptance. Instead, she became increasingly obsessed with her flowers. The more hydrangeas and roses and irises I saw, the less of her there seemed to be. She slowly faded into the leaves and petals that surrounded her.

On the fifth anniversary of his death, I went to visit Lily, a jar of homemade chocolate chip cookies in my hands and a pile of condolences on the tip of my tongue. She didn’t answer when I rang the doorbell, so I walked to the garden fence.

I was shocked by the sight of overgrown vines and withered flowers. I unlatched the gate and walked through the garden, calling out her name. The bare magnolia tree creaked in protest in the wind. Her prized orchids had been replaced by undulating cobwebs. There was no sign of her.

On my way home, I drove to her husband's grave. The graveyard was empty, but as I approached her husband’s headstone, I saw a spot of color.

In front of the stone was a freshly planted lily, the innocent pink petals folded out in silent protest against the grey that surrounded them.

It was the most beautiful flower I had ever seen.";16197127350
Seeds;51;19;"You know those mystery seed packets that people were getting in the mail last year? The ones that came from who knows where and that nobody ordered?

The official word from the government was to not plant them. We were supposed to contact our state department of agriculture and get instructions on what to do with them. After all, no one knew what might grow, it might be an invasive species. Or maybe something dangerous. But me? I planted them. I love plants and people were just dying to see what would grow.

I wasn’t disappointed, I loved the strange plants that grew from my seeds. I’d never seen anything like them before.

Carnivorous plants have always held a fascination for me. I love my venus fly traps, I feed them little pieces of meat and they grab them and digest them, just as if they’d caught a fly. I have pitcher plants as well. These new plants were a great addition to my collection.

But the plants quickly got too big for tiny chunks of hamburger. I started giving them steaks, but that was getting expensive. They were eating a lot of steak. Fortunately, I found a solution that cost me nothing and did the world some good at the same time. I started inviting in solicitors and Jehovah’s witnesses. Then I’d introduce them to my plants. Everyone was happy. Well, me and my beautiful plants were happy at least.

I do regret the girl scouts, I do feel bad about them. But I eat too many of those cookies, they’re not good for my weight. You should always watch what you eat.";16197629810

Faceless;1944;96;"My brother J.C. was born without a face. It was kind of a big deal at the time, and he even made it to the local newspaper, but the next day old man Jenkins came into possession of a pig with three tails, and so everyone quickly forgot about J.C.

*Can’t you cut him some eyes at least*, Pa asked Doc Faraday.

*‘fraid it doesn’t work like that, Wade*, the doc told him. *Might just cut into his brain by accident. Could give them specialists over at Fletcher H a call, though.*

*Nah, ain’t doing that. Don’t want the attention.* Pa said.

And so they didn’t. For a while I thought maybe I wanted that, to be found, to be seen by someone else, but I guess I didn’t have it half bad. I had my own room after all, and sometimes I even got to see the sun.

Pa didn’t like J.C. much, so he lived in the hole most of the time. I already felt bad for him for having no face and all, but he also got most of the beatings, and I don’t think he ever lived a day without a broken bone inside of him somewhere.

I’d cry a lot, and if it wasn’t for Ma I guess I would have done what Eurodyce did, and just stopped eating and drinking until it hurt no more. Ma’d hold me tight every night after Pa’d finished beating J.C, and she wouldn’t leave until I fell asleep.

When I learned the truth it was a night like most others. Pa’d been roughing up J.C. down in the hole, but he wasn’t done violencing, so he figured he’d hurt me some too. I was used to it by then, so I let him kick me around for a while, and I don’t think he even managed to break anything before Ma stormed in.

I’d never seen my Pa afraid. It just wasn’t a face he’d wear. But that night he turned into a snivelling snot-nosed little kid right in front of me.

*It...It can’t be*, he mumbled. *You ain’t real. You’re fuckin’...fuckin’ dead.*

Ma didn’t speak a word, and I didn’t understand what he was on about. She wasn’t dead. She had always been there.

But then she changed. Her face melted away like lumpy blood butter, liquid flesh dripping to the floor.

*You!* my Pa snarled viciously. *You killed her, you fuckin’ freak. She died the moment you came out of her.*

He wasn’t afraid no more, but it was too late. J.C. swung the axe true, and it got stuck deep in Pa’s neck. He bled out in anguish and fear, and it was the happiest day of my life.

We tossed him in the hole, and covered it forever.

It’s just me and J.C. now, and we survive just fine. We still get Pa’s disability checks, and sometimes, when people come around, it’s like Pa’s still here you know.

Well, his face anyway.";16196630920
I Hear Snoring, But No One Is Home.;11;2;"i’m 17 living with my mom, grandma, brother, and step dad. There is always someone home during the day unless it’s to pick up my brother from school or someone is at work. For the past 4 years of my life i’ve been experiencing extreme illusions and paranoia, You really couldn’t believe the things that I see and dream about. That’a a story for another time though. 

I recently got a kitten named pennyroyal (named after the song PennyRoyal Tea by Nirvana) but i call her penny for short. I believed cats make ghosts and spirits like that go away and she’s been making me pretty relaxed. Even though I have a dog he’s just a tiny chihuahua mixed with a french bulldog, he’s a tough little man but I feel like spirits wouldn’t mind him. 

Anyways point is the cat has been making me less paranoid about spirits and such things like that, cause most of my life I feel like i’ve been followed, attacked, and even talked to spirits. 


So today me and my girlfriend hung out before she went back to school, we are hanging out with the kitten, my mom leaves for work so she comes and says bye to the kitten. My Grandma goes out and runs around town trying to get “get shit done” and picking up my brother. My step dad goes back to work after his lunch break at home and finally my girlfriend had to leave for school. I usually walk her to school and walk back home for a little air. As I get back home i realized my grandma has left and took the dogs with her to run errands, so i’m completely alone. 

The kitten is sleeping in her little bed i made her and i’m just playing Call Of Duty Cold War trying to level up the new ballistic knife, then i hear it. 

Sharp inhales, breathing in so fast but exhaling for so long. At this point i’m grabbing every knife I own and being a 17 year old teenage boy with a lot of anger issues I’m ready to defend myself and my home from whoever could be in my room or in my brothers (since our rooms are next to each other and I can hear him snore sometimes) I check every part of the house and every corner and hiding spot there is and yelling out whoever the fuck is there to get out. I should’ve mentioned i’ve had a history of doing these kind of outbursts where I think someone is living in my house because of stories like this and my paranoia. I’ve taken lots of LSD in the past and made it way worse so I don’t doubt this helps. But this time felt like it was real.


I soon find out it’s in my room coming from a wall in my room. Honestly was just the wall next to my closet, but still. I could see the walls breathing and snorting. I was so confused I thought it was a person somehow in the walls or some kind of animal. but being mad and frustrated I stabbed the part of the wall that was “breathing”. it didn’t stop. I soon punched a whole to see through it and there was nothing. 

The whole wall stopped moving and it just went back to normal. i don’t hear the snoring anymore. I might write another post about this if it happens again. if not i’m definitely telling the stories of what I dream about soon. Because in all honesty my whole life is full of weird and disturbing stories";16197599050
God Doesn't Draw in Straight Lines;20;6;"A young student in my elementary-school class has the neatest handwriting I've ever seen. At a glance, you'd swear her words are printed, not written. It is truly something beautiful.


I use any excuse to ask her to stand at the front of the classroom and write on the whiteboard. Some of the other students think ""witch!""


The girl is nonverbal, though sometimes she emits a shrill squark, when started. Her father informed me, sadly, that she'd only ever spoken one word, though he wouldn't tell me what that word was.


""It is a tragedy that she is unable to appropriately express emotion"", I wrote in my report.


What is especially strange is the way that the girl can grip a marker-pen and draw a straight line. And I mean spirit-level straight. At a glance. 


She doesn't even seem to try to concentrate; she simply sketches away. She makes every stroke seem so effortless: Parallel lines, vertical and horizontal. Like a lattice, like a cage. Sometimes I swear I see a fleeting hurt in her eyes. Then she suppresses it. Too late. How her classmates hate her. They love to see her fail. 


I'll not ever forget her. She is like an artist. Such a vanishingly rare experience, to watch her write, to watch her draw. To watch her hold an object in her hand. To hear her tiny, frustrated sighs. So quaint. So defective. At only 400x, we can see the imperfections within her work. Perhaps she is the last of her kind.


I failed her, again and again. 


Literally failed her. She is a student, however defective. She is my responsibility.


But what can I do? If I give her a ""pass"", she'd be found out straight away. You can't fake your way through an entire 175-year warranty.";16197368120
It'll Come Back To You;196;17;"*I don’t recognize these hands*.

&#x200B;

This was the first thought that entered my mind after my eyes opened. 

&#x200B;

*These are not my hands.* 

&#x200B;

A team of doctors surrounded me for the next few hours. They meticulously checked to make sure I had feeling throughout my body, asking me to move my appendages and if I could feel pinpricks across my body. Being able to perform these basic tasks gave me hope, though any memory of who I was or what had happened to me had simply vanished. 

&#x200B;

“Victor?”

&#x200B;

*Victor. This must be my name.*

&#x200B;

“The procedure seems to have been a complete success,” a white-haired doctor who appeared to be the lead of his team spoke, “You will gradually gain back your motor skills, speech and memory. Do your best to remain calm.”

&#x200B;

So I tried, even after I awoke one evening to find I was now held down with restraints. The staff came in every few hours, yet they ignored my obvious distress, and once I was able to speak again they were deaf to my pleas.

&#x200B;

*“Somebody, please, what has happened to me?!”*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The nightmare continued for seven days, in that time not a word was spoken to me. Finally, the white-haired doctor returned, bringing a man in black robes with him. 

&#x200B;

“Victor, I’m here to explain to you the operation you underwent-” the doctor began. 

&#x200B;

“Do you recognize this person?” the robed man interrupted, holding a photograph to my face. I squinted at it, the face was familiar but I couldn’t place it. 

&#x200B;

“It’s you, Victor,” he said and I nearly gagged, “Or, it was you.”

&#x200B;

“Yes, Victor, you have been transplanted,” the doctor interjected, eyeing the man with disdain.

&#x200B;

“What, what are you talking about?” I asked, my heart rate increasing on the monitor. 

&#x200B;

“Your brain was preserved cryogenically after your death until a time when you could, well, continue living. We didn’t have a host body available right away.”

&#x200B;

“I… don’t believe this, I… wouldn’t…”

&#x200B;

“Memory not so good, Victor? Maybe this will help,” the robed man sneered, holding up a second photograph. The woman smiling back at me... I knew her somehow... 

&#x200B;

“Please, no!” I screamed, desperate to escape her accusatory eyes as memories of her death came flooding back. 

&#x200B;

“Well, Victor, you look like you’ve seen a ghost! Oh, I guess you have!” the man cackled. The doctor grimaced and addressed him.

&#x200B;

“He’s just had a shock, please, do not press him like this.”

&#x200B;

“Remember who you’re talking to,"" the man growled, taking a threatening step toward him, ""The State has no need for anyone who sympathizes with murderers.""

&#x200B;

The doctor backed away and apologized, taking one last look at my stricken face before retreating out of the room. 

&#x200B;

""Victor, by the power granted to me as State Executioner, I hereby welcome you to your third of twelve life sentences,"" the man said, turning to me with menace in his eyes, ""Let's see how much pain *this* host can endure.""";16196919690
Bonding With Cigarettes;49;4;"You might find me in the smoking area of a nightclub. If there's someone there that grabs my attention for all the wrong reasons - talking loudly, or just being a general nuisance - then I'll go over and offer them a cigarette.

Why?

Because it makes me feel good about myself.

*Because it stops you from talking too much*.

Because it is a way to keep the peace.

*Because this place is your only way of having fun*.

Because no smoker can say ""no"" to such a kind offer.

*Because you think I'm relatable.*

Because it's sexy.

*Because it takes eleven minutes off your life.*

Because it's a fine way to relax.

*Because I like the idea of watching you die right before my eyes.*

. . .

Because it's the start of a friendship.

*Because it makes me feel good about myself for what I'm soon going to do when this place closes.*

Because it means we can share a taxi.

*Because it is a way to keep the peace, before you experience the war---and let me tell you that you're not the only person that has or will experience it.*

Because another cigarette would seem rejective while I walk home the same way as you.

*Because no smoker can say ""no"" to such a kind offer that has no real meaning other than to wedge my way in like some relentless cockroach too fast for your feet*.

Because I can lead us down a quicker route.

*Because it's sexy to lure you in, to share our dance, and there's an intimacy between us that I can't quite explain, right before I know that I've got you, that there's no way out*.

Because I can pull out the knife as you flick your lighter for the next one (""the last smoke before we part""...which isn't at all a lie!)

*Because it's a fine way to relax, before I kill you*.";16197169790

Aboard Humanity;113;9;"The first breath of life is always the sweetest. Most people experience it only once, others, twice. Despite lungs burning like no tomorrow, and ribs cracking to make room for this first breath, it is still sweet, and lingers for a while on the tongue, like a mint.

This would be Celeste’s second first breath. The first, when she was born to two average parents in average America. This one is different, not just because of the location, but because of the taste. Instead of room temperature (65-70°F, in American terms), it was cold, cold enough to fog the glass that encased her in her pod. Celeste was one of 10,000 humans aboard *Humanity*, a ship that left America and Earth behind, in search of a better place for the ships’ namesake to survive.

Celeste’s eyes pop open, only to be instantly bombarded by fluorescent lights. Blinking her way through tears, and about 25 years of ‘sleep’, she took in her surroundings. Still in the pod, there wasn’t much to see. Leaning towards the glass allows her to see her feet, but the strain of moving her muscles and bones limit the amount of time she can see her feet. All in all, the pod is about two feet at the base, and is as tall as her. Her limbs are cold, but moving them to warm herself hurts more than the cold. Wiping the fog of her first exhale off the glass, she can see some of the other pods and people on *Humanity*.

All dark.

Something is not right.

Celeste’s hand goes to the interior switch, that would allow her to leave.

It doesn’t budge.

“Damn Auto-lock” she mutters, her throat burning under the strain of speech.

She tries again, and again it doesn’t budge.

Her eyes snap to a countdown on the wall opposite her, the one that tells the internal computer when to let everyone wake.

400 years, 5 months, 2 weeks, and 3 days left.

Oh God.

Frantic, she tries pushing her whole body on the pod door, praying this works.

Nothing happens.

Despite her intense training, Celeste starts to hyperventilate, breath obscuring the countdown to death.

Her lungs burn more, and her head spins.

She keeps trying, shaky fingers turning blue, the shivering not being enough to prevent her bones from feeling numb.

Celeste stops to ask why she is even trying, and slumps on the glass

“This is it, then.”

The house;15;0;"There is a house near where I live. It is quite old - it dates back to around 1800 - and is also abandoned. The glass is broken, the walls are covered with moss and so on. That house has always seemed strange enough to me. Whenever I came home from work or before bed, I would look at her from my window. Sometimes I would have sworn to see some shape wandering around there. He wasn't a real person. It was more of a shadow with little outlines.

 I decided to go inside. I would be lying if I said I saw something paranormal: nothing happened. The only thing that made me a little nervous was a painting in the living room. It depicted a man in his thirties, with blond hair and good-looking. 

The photo dates back to 1855. 

The problem?

The man not only looked terribly like me, but he also had my name. 

And, searching for his name on Google, I discovered that in life he was a killer who hid the bodies of his victims under the beams of that cursed house.";16197364340
Just pay the God damn car park charges;11;2;"
I fine owners of cars who haven’t paid for a car park space and it really irritates me when somebody doesn’t pay the meter. I mean its just so god damn selfish to park somewhere without paying the proper fares if it is mandatory to do so. As a parking attendant drivers hate me and I receive a lot of abuse, but believe me that I do not give a crap about what you do if you just pay the god damn fare. I mean why can’t life be just simple where everyone pays the god damn parking charge. 

I mean there is a guy who parks on the same road with a white van and he clearly has worried scared frightened children inside the van. I even saw him take the children and forcibly put them in a van where no one was watching. This guy though pays his parking charges for every day he has parked his car on that road and so I don’t bother him. Sometimes the kids inside the van try to desperately get my attention but I just ignore them. When I saw posters of missing kids I decided to keep it to myself.  

It feels good keeping things to ones self because living in a society where we have to give everything and more, it feels great keeping something to myself. Then there is another woman who keeps parking her car on some road which has parking charges. She pays the charges everyday and I don’t care that she has chopped off heads inside her car, because she paid for her car parking charge and that’s all I care about.  

Drivers always hassling me about how they are so busy or they have this or that going on in their lives as an excuse to not pay the parking charges, I don’t care about your lives and so you should just pay the parking charge. Recently everyone has been looking for some car that had hit and killed a person and just sped off. That car has been parking on some well hidden road where there is car parking charges, and you know what I don’t care because the owner of that car pays his car parking charges for everyday he has his car parked there.  

It feels great keeping stuff to myself and it feels selfish and I love feeling selfish. What I love more about people paying the car park charges is keeping stuff to myself. Like this woman who started having a conversation with me even though I didn’t care. I acted like I cared but what I kept to myself is her baby that I secretly nicked from her pram which I kept to myself.  

I love keeping stuff to myself.";16197393270
I know when someone is going to die;114;7;"I know when someone is going to die. I call it a gift, if you will. It is incredibly useful to me.

My ability first manifested in middle school. I was in the same class as a kid called Jake, who was a bit of a bully. I couldn’t stand him.

So one day I said to him. “You’re going to die on Wednesday.”

Jake laughed in my face, and spat in it for good measure. But he wasn’t laughing on Wednesday, when he opened his lunchbox. Thousands of little red ants spilled out from his sandwiches, crawling up his arms and wriggling beneath his eyes and nose and ears. Soon he was covered in a sea of red, and I could see shadows of ants dancing in the whites. He tried to flick some off with his hand, but more kept coming.

Then everybody chomped down at the same time.

Jake screamed like a girl, and I could see ants marching on his teeth like braces. Little red boils emerged under swollen skin, swelling until they were as hard as little rocks. Then they popped on their own, releasing globs of green pus. Jake erupted in a human volcano, green pus sliding to the floor, and when his screams quietened down I knew he had passed.

***

When I grew up, I decided to make a business out of it. Isn’t it incredibly useful to know when you die?

You will be surprised. Thousands of high-profile clients come to see me, in secret, in the dark, bringing with them their riches. Then I will look them dead in the eyes, and tell them:

&#x200B;

“You will die tomorrow.”

&#x200B;

Or maybe:

&#x200B;

“You will die next month.”

There’s one person called Mary that I remember. She was a socialite in the upper class, all pearls and makeup and jewels. She came to me, under cover of the night, with the moon sparkling through the trees.

“Tell me,” she whispered.

I shrugged. “Later tonight. $500 please.”

She paid, and I could see her looking fearfully left and right, perhaps fearing she would be mowed over by a car. What she should have done instead was keep her windows locked. A cloud of ravens with sleek feathers as black as ebony and long, yellow beaks, came flocking in her room that night. Their beaks drilled into her skin, tearing away globs of flesh, and drank her tears. I heard they feasted until sunrise.

The court ruled it as a freak accident. Of course it did. I am never caught.

You see, I hated Jake, so I lured red ants in a jar with a bit of honey and dumped them in his lunchbox when he was out buying a drink. I hated Mary for being such a snob and turning her nose at us. It wasn’t easy catching those ravens, but I did it.

I can confidently say now that I don’t just predict death.

Dementia or reincarnation?;19;1;"

Back in 2017 my grandpa was diagnosed with dementia, as he would forget a lot of things and he even forgot the names of his loved one’s. He would also ask us (me and my mom) where Mary was. We, not knowing who the fuck Mary was, joked that she was out at the supermarket. He would look us dead in the eye and say “No, she’s not.” We thought it was weird, but thought that it was just an effect of his dementia. He would also look at me emotionless and say: “I would do it again, if I had to.”

3 years flew by and grandpa still had these “effects”. It was a really hot Saturday and I was at my grandpa to take care of him. I was making lunch, when he said: “Luka, Mary’s not here, is she?” I was shocked. “You remember my name?” I said happy. “Of course I do.” he said. “Sorry I never said your name. I was confused with some other fella’s you knew once too.” I was confused. “Mary probably didn’t make it to a new life.” he continued. “I was so excited to see her again once.” 

“What was her full name?” I asked curiously. He looked at me as if I knew what her name was. “Mary Goodwill.” He said dreamy. “The next day I googled Mary Goodwill. It took 2 hours to find a website where dead people have their own “wiki”. I typed in her name and she was there! But what I read made me nervous: Mary Goodwill: born May 5th 1954, died July 6th 1998. She died the day I was born. I read a bit further. At the bottom of the page it explained the cause of death. To understand why I’m so freaked out about it you have to understand my one fear: fire. I’m so scared of fire, I even get uncomfortable when there are some candles lit. And Mary’s cause of death was burning alive.

I am the reincarnation of Mary Goodwill.";16197148490

Nihilism;139;10;"We had many names for It. 


Sloth.


Laziness.


Apathy. 


Depression.


Nihilism.


One day, it spread like wildfire. 


It started small, as these things do. Large groups of people quit their jobs, with little to no warning. Many did not have opportunities lined up, but didn’t seem bothered, muttering “who fucking cares?” when asked about future prospects.


The more people that quit in waves, the more society began to crumble. Within a month infrastructure was deteriorating, electricity was off, and almost every business had shut down. The government tried to keep things running, but ultimately, enough employees couldn’t find the point of continuing, so they quit.  


The source was tracked down. A researcher in NASA discovered the origin of life, and it proved that life was an anomaly. Truly a random chance encounter of amino acids, iron sulfide reactions, and water. There was no life outside our planet, and there never would be. 


Humans, and life on Earth in general, were a mistake. An accident. No purpose was served with their existence, and nothing would ever exist to remember them.


Somehow, the researchers' apathy spread across the globe. His thoughts of isolation, uselessness, unimportance, spread across his lab, then to the researchers families, and so on, until the entire planet was fully aware of a terrifying truth. 


There was no true purpose to any of this. Life was a little blip in the universe, a strange bunch of chemical reactions that ultimately served no real purpose. No amount of money, fame, or gratification could undo this knowledge.     


And so people began to give up. Many killed themselves, not even bothering to leave notes to their loved ones. Why bother? They already understood why. 


Some just wasted away, staring at nothing. They sat back playing games on their phone, watching the world deteriorate around them, not even caring as people around them died. 


Many starved. They would die in front of plates of food, or an empty pantry, because they couldn’t work up the nerve to cook anything, or even undergo the process of eating. 


Life was too much work, for no real reward. So they gave up on life. 


Decades after, there wasn’t much left. Those still alive felt some validation (“see, it never mattered anyway!), but they still had to live with the minimum amount of optimism possible. Not even sex was an escape, the dopamine hit didn’t last very long, and the idea of procreation seemed like a curse. A new baby was really just continuing the cycle of “why bother?”


Years later, the last man on Earth began to inhale, then breathed back out, wondering what the point of moving his chest up and down would accomplish. 


Coming up with no answer, the last man died. ";16196588220
Shhh, Perhaps You Need This;48;8;"“Shhhh. It’s okay. You’re fine right now. I saw you the other day in that car park. You know D section where you park, where the light sometimes flickers on? When it did and bathed you in that mellow glow, I gasped I was so caught off guard. I knew. I knew right then and there. Or, at least, I knew the potential was there, but approaches can be tricky.”

“Don’t struggle. It won’t do any good. I’m much heavier than you and with my chest on yours, you don’t stand a chance. I learned this from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu…..how to control a body. I can feel your nipples. God they feel like little rocks and while I know they’re hard because you’re afraid, I’m choosing to believe that it’s because, somewhere deep inside of you, you want this.”

“Perhaps on some level you did. Perhaps that’s why I chose you. I have to admit that these decisions are not always clear. Sometimes, I see someone walk and I just know. Other times, like yours, it’s your eyebrows. They’re so fine and, now that I’m feeling them, much softer than many of the others. And there are little details, like the snowy hair that no one can even see unless they’re this close. I’m sure your boyfriend will miss this.”

“You have to understand that I would love to release my grip to hear what you’re saying. I hate to tell you this, but muffled screams excite me more. Oh yes, just like this one. And, somehow, with your blackened tears streaming to the sides, this moment is simple perfection. Ghandi always said, ‘Be the change you wish to see.’ What he meant by this was create the world you want. In this moment right now, this is my creation.”

“Need is such a curious thing, don’t you agree? I don’t need you for physical sex and, indeed, that’s not why you’re here. This is not rape. This is murder. You see this blade? I’m going to insert it between your ribs in just one moment. But I promise, I will not pierce your heart. You would die far too quickly that way. Yes, that’s the scream I’ve been wanting. God, that’s good. Now look down at the handle. You see how it’s bobbing up and down to the rhythm of your heart? I always place the flat of the blade against it. It’s such wonderful beat. No wonder greats like Shakespeare, Donn, Milton and Chaucer used it as a way of writing.”

“This is the end. You’ve been so heavenly. I wonder. Afterwards, will you be waiting for me there? I tend to think that when you die it’s just darkness and that we create heaven and hell here on Earth. It’s odd to think that your living hell balances my greedy heaven. I’m going to lever the blade and puncture your heart now. God, yes. Look at how the blood pools beautifully upon your bosom. Quiet now. Shhh.”";16196733470
A Stroll at Night;2;0;"It was another sleepless summer night when I left my boyfriend's side for a walk and a cigarette.

The area where we lived at the time, the middle of nowhere, was safe, with the rare wild encounter of bobcats and foxes. Not once, I saw another person outside the road leading toward the nearest town. There were no urban legends that would make me afraid of going out alone after dark.

Slipping my bare feet into a comfortable pair of sneakers, lighter and cigarette box in hand, I pushed the back door open. I took a deep breath of fresh air, enjoying the cool sensation against my naked chest. Sighing as my convoluted thoughts wouldn't go away, my eyes went up to the stars. A shooting star made me smile, distracting me for a second or two before I took my first cigarette. Inhaling a long drag of smoke, I headed toward the open field that surrounded our home.

Without rush, I let my feet take me in another uncharted hiking. The Victorian-style, two stories house could be spotted at any time from almost anywhere around the plains. So I was always confident I'd find my way back home.

The grass reached past my calves, and under the full moon, I saw nothing but pastures, far rolling hills, and solitarily trees here and there. It was a beautiful landscape, even after sundown. It was soothing for me, an open space, seemingly endless that felt tiny and comforting, like an embrace.

The far horizon mixed land with sky, making it seem like the stars slowly rolled their way up from inside the Earth. With half cigarette gone, I looked back, staring at the dark shape of the house. Smiling at the thought of my sleeping companion, recalling how halm he looked when I left the bed, I felt envy for an instant. It was an innocent feeling. I always wished I could sleep normally, but sleep is not my friend.

Continuing with my walk, I only took a couple of steps when I saw a flash of light behind me, like lighting. My first reaction was to glance up, though the sky was clear. Turning over my shoulder, I made sure the house was on fire or something. The still shape rested in the dark, untouched, so I dismissed the weird event. I didn't think much of it, my not very scientific mind lacking the skill to make up any hypothesis.

I kept walking, somewhat circling our home, for the time that took me to finish four cigarettes. Feeling tired, at least physically after working all day, I decided it was time to go back. Taking a fifth cigarette, I hoped I'd be able to sleep before sunrise, even if it was only a couple of hours. Through the back door, I stepped inside, making my way upstairs to our bedroom. My boyfriend wasn't there, and I never saw him again.";16197253100
Father;467;17;"My father has always been the kind of man who somehow could get out of any situation unscathed. People generally warmed to him really quickly and he would always use this to protect himself and his family.

I remember once when I was 12, I accidentally knocked over a motorcycle outside of a shop and the biker came out and started screaming at me. My father managed to calm the man down and they ended up becoming friends.

He was the one who realised there was something wrong with the news reports as they kept being vague about what was going on. He started stockpiling food and supplies just in case he was right 

His survival skills helped keep us alive when the troubles started, as he somehow had a knack for knowing when to hide and when to run.

We have been holed up in a farmhouse for the last few days with barely any food or water and we are all really cranky. My father is constantly trying to keep my baby brother distracted by playing peekaboo.

Suddenly my mother came running into the house and told us to hide as she had seen a horde of undead up the road. We all quickly grabbed what we could and ran down to the basement.

We sat in silence listening to the sound of the furniture upstairs being knocked about. We prayed that the horde would just move on.

My brother began to cry as he was hungry and tired and I could see the look of panic cross my father's face. I didn't have time to react as I watched him grab my brother's body and snap his neck.";16196235390
Myranda;24;3;" 

I sat on the chair, tapping my fingers against the metal table. Today I was conducting another case for my study on female serial killers for the Bureau, and this girl was my crown jewel.

&#x200B;

The sound of chains and the keys turning got my attention. I saw Bernard escorting the prettiest sociopath I had ever seen into the room. My partner McKinnon warned me that Myranda Burns tended to have that sort of effect on people.

&#x200B;

'Hey, Bernard. Can you please uncuff Myranda here for me? It helps the prisoner feel more comfortable.' Bernard regarded Myranda suspiciously. During this pause, the girl had the nerve to speak. 'Don't worry, Bernie. You know I don't bite.' She said with an innocent smile plastered on her pale face.

&#x200B;

Once Bernard sat Myranda down, unlocked her handcuffs and shuffled out of the room, I took out my phone and placed it on the table next to me. Myranda paid no attention to the phone and chose to focus on me. I could feel her grey eyes studying me, stripping off my clothes and skin to look directly into my soul.

&#x200B;

'Well, Myranda. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. As indicated in my letter, I am conducting a study on female serial killers. Anything spoken in this interview will be used in my research. Do you consent to that?' Myranda nodded, still studying me. 'Good. Now let's get started. Can you tell me how a pretty, smart, 22-year old recently graduated university student graduates to the murder of five girls?'

&#x200B;

Myranda looked at me as if she saw me for the first time. She started with her childhood. It was different to those that fit the profile: Two active parents (both marine biologists), no previous sexual assault, no harming small animals, no prior offences. As she got older, the signs still weren't there.

&#x200B;

We moved on to talking about random facts; she knew a lot of random facts (she could name every state capital in alphabetical order). I decided that now she was warming to me; it was time to drop the question. 'So, Myranda. Why did you do it? Kill those girls?' She brushed the light-auburn strands that had fallen in front of her eyes and smirked at me.

&#x200B;

'I believe that control is an illusion. Nobody is really in control. You may think you're in control here, Jaimie, but you *need* me. I can see the hunger in your eyes. When you started your project, you thought of me first. Just say that you need me. Admit your lack of control. Admit that the only reason you started this was to find out why your sister cut your parents to pieces while you watched cartoons in the lounge...'

&#x200B;

I shut down the recording and called for Bernard. Back in my car, I banged my head against the steering wheel in frustration while the tears flowed. I did need her, and it tore me apart.";16196824430
My husband won’t stop snoring.;63;4;"My husband has been snoring at night for as long as I’ve known him.

At first it wasn’t really a problem. I’ve teased him about it, for sure, but never too seriously. John is the breadwinner of the house, so I just make up for lost sleep by sleeping in after he leaves for work, and that has always suited me fine.

Until we had Maisie.

I wouldn’t trade my daughter for the world, but she’s a baby, for god’s sake. I can’t blame her for waking me up in the middle of the night crying.

I do blame John, though.

I didn’t mind so much when it was just me he was waking up with that incessant, droning, drawn-out snoring. But now he’s waking up Maisie, and the poor thing starts wailing and screaming for me to hold her and soothe her until she’s ready to go back to bed.

I can’t sleep in anymore, either. Maisie’s an early riser, and she needs all my attention. She just hit 5 months, and I haven’t gotten a full night’s sleep in I don’t know when. I’m worried she might have inherited whatever breathing problem John’s got, so I can’t even catnap whenever she does. I have to keep an eye on her.
John won’t go to the doctor, either, or try those nose strips that are supposed to stop snoring. He says it doesn’t bother him.

That’s okay. I might have found a solution on my own.

Today, Maisie and I had a little incident. A tick bit her chubby little leg, and I about lost my mind. I was able to get it off without any trouble, though, and I’ve already got a doctor’s appointment booked tomorrow to make sure she’s okay. No harm done.

But I kept the tick, and just a minute ago, accompanied by that awful grating snoring, I dropped it into John’s gaping mouth and made sure it latched on.

He’s still snoring, and I still can’t sleep, but that’s okay.

I can sit and watch it swell up on the roof of his open mouth.";16196547440

Bones;36;5;"  

I ain’t never broken a bone before. 

Daddy called me “clumsy n' reklis” cuz I was always climbin’ stuff. Sure, I’d fall off e’ry now an’ then, but I wasn’t gonna be stopped by no scraped knee or bruised elbow! I’ll tell ya, you shoulda see the angry look on my Ma’s face e’ry time I came home with torn clothes and a scratched-up face.

She had a temper, that’s for sure. She didn’t take to no lazin’ or disrespectin’ from neither me nor my sisters – see, she was a strict ‘un. An’ me and my sisters got the back end of a spoon often to teach us a lesson! I wasn’t too sure what that lesson was to be entirely candid with yous - But my sisters behaved, that you can be certain. They went to school like Ma told us to, an’ they grew up as fine young lasses. One of ‘em even had a young ‘un herself not too long ago.

Me? I ain’t too certain what to tell you, stranger. I didn’t understand what those lessons Ma gave us meant, not at the time, at least. See, when she would hit that spoon across my sisters’ hands, they would holler and yell like the sky was fallin’. But me? I just felt a touch, and I didn’t get why my sisters where cryin’; is not like the spoon made ‘em feel hungry. Or cold.

Once, after I came home with another torn shirt and a bit of a bloody lip, Ma was so upset. She dragged me to a big, fancy buildin’ where the doctors all had these big machines. I can’t say how long I was in there, but after, Ma told me that the doctors said I couldn’t feel pain. Now, I knew that word – it meant somethin' bad, it meant you weren’t supposed to do somethin'.

I still don’t get what I’m missing, and I’ve tried real hard to understand. My sisters tried to tell me, but they couldn’t describe it good, even when I reminded them with the old spoon. My lil niece was so cute, she tried to ‘splain with her lil baby words, but even she couldn’t keep her words together enough to tell me; an’ cryin’ ain’t no good to me. Ma also wasn’t any good at making me understand, even when I pushed her down the stairs, so she could tell me what it was meant to feel like. I’d fallen down those same damn stairs myself, you see? Daddy was the best at describin’, he ‘splained so well when I shot him in the neck, like he did to that old dog when we was small.

So, tell me, stranger: I’ve never broken a bone – at least I don’t think I have. And I want you to tell me what it feels like. It’s okay if you don’t remember, no, it’s okay. I’ll help you remember.";16196459470
Love Sucks;13;6;"I tell ya what. Love? It *sucks*. You go your whole miserable existence making sure that awful feeling never makes its way into your life so you can continue focusing on what's important. Then **BAM** Some hunk of a dream boat shows up at your job as your new colleague. 

Eyes? Gorgeous. Body? Yum. Brains? If I were a zombie, I'd be in Heaven. Then he has this voice you could listen to for days. You share common interests, your conversations make you forget the world around you, it's nuts and should be illegal. It was time to put a stop to this. 

I lured him to my home under false pretenses of needing some help with a work related subject. The sucker believed me. We spent the night tip-tap-typing away on my laptop while I feigned confusion and made myself out to be your typical damsel in distress. Finally the clichè ""my hero"" moment. 

My arms flung around his neck and I left the longest peck upon his lips, savoring the moment and dreading its end. What surprised me was his arms wrapping around my waist and his joining on my kiss. Looks like my feeling wasn't as unrequited as I'd thought.

It was now or never. Our passionate moment lingered as I slowly pulled a pocket knife from my back pocket and pushed the blade deep into his abdomen. He choked a bit as he fell away from our kiss, then fell to his knees before face planting into the floor. I watched him heave and twitch for what felt like hours until he was finally still. When I rolled him onto his back his eyes were widened, but it was clear he was no longer breathing.

That should get rid of that pesky feeling of love... At least until the next one comes along.";16196645960
Learn and Growing Up;24;6;"Have you ever wondered why babies could speak? It’s because they look at us and mimic us. They learn from just looking.

When they grow up to become a toddler, their behaviors is based on the people around them.

Going to school, friends can easily influence the way they act, bad friends lead to bad actions.

When they grow up as a teenager, they are going through a phase of human called “the rebelion phase”. They act more aggresive than usual, but most of the time, they will soon grow out of it. It’s just teen stuff. They also care about attention, and Tv programs also shape them and make who they are.

But what if everything they learned from when they were a little kid to when they are teenagers just end in a bad result? 

What happened if the kid you raised, live in a bad environment, play with bad friends, watch things that shape them in a bad way, and is usually bullied?

I am writing this to tell you that, watch after your child, you don’t know what they could become. 

I should’ve loved him more, I should’ve cared for him more. 

Because if I did, the incident maybe wouldn’t have occured, maybe his friends would still be alive, maybe he would have been sitting next to me, talking to me right now and I wouldn’t have to write this. Maybe he wouldn’t have been behind bars.";16196505210

Without so much enthusiasm, I decided to remain in bed 5 more minutes; but before I could console my sleep I felt by my side as some legs grazed mine, then I remembered my niece was sleeping with me during the week so I didn't gave it much importance.

But honestly, the most strange part was the intense and horrible smell that I realized was filling the room but, as I told, I was so tired to even care so just tried to go back to sleep.

But in that moment I had to open my eyes once again, as the door of the room opened with my niece on the outside asking me:

A CURSED HEARSE;223;7;"The traffic light outside City Cemetery turned green.  I stepped down hard on the gas pedal and heaved the cracked and sun-worn steering wheel, turning the hearse left onto York Road.  As I picked up speed the exhaust pipe began to sputter and cough and the entire vehicle jolted violently as it shifted gears into third. 
 


What a hunk of junk. 
 


Old man Richards liked to call himself frugal. 
 


But the rest of us called him what he was: a penny-pinching miser with no concern for anything but his growing bank account. 
 


I guessed that was why he had picked out the oddest, oldest-looking hearse I had ever laid eyes on to replace our old #2.  The better hearse he liked to send out for the fancier affairs, while he used #2 (adequately named) for the jobs with less wealthy clients. 
 


The whole thing stank of unfairness since everyone paid the same rate for that part of the service, but in any event I was the one stuck driving the thing.  Those decisions were far above my meager pay grade.    
 


Something disrupted my thoughts.  A noise from the back of the hearse like movement.
 


But that’s impossible, since there’s no one back there except…
 


Memories came to mind of graveyard stories.  People being buried alive.  Ropes dangling down in the coffins far below the earth so that if someone were to wake up…
 


RING A DING DING.
 


My phone began to ring at that exact moment, making me jump.  That caused me to swerve slightly into the next lane.  The car beside mine honked loudly and the driver rolled down his window and gave me the finger before speeding off. 
 


The ringtone was still playing but I ignored it, straining my ears to hear the sound again.  Was someone back there? 
 


Suddenly I heard hinges creak as the casket lid swung open and cracked hard against the window, splintering the glass.
 


My heart was beating out of my chest as the phone rang and rang.  Sweat was suddenly on my brow and drenching my armpits. 
 


I heard a rattling cough, a wheezing, choked breathing noise. 
 


My foot began to lose pressure on the gas pedal.  There were cars suddenly speeding past and I realized I was in the middle of the road just creeping slowly along, now unable to control any of my muscles, unable to tell myself to put the hearse into park.  To get out.  To run. 
 


Still my cell phone rang incessantly.  It had gone to voicemail but then began to ring all over again. 
 


There was a sound of shoes on the floor now.  I looked and saw his pale, waxy face in the mirror.  He came forward and I could smell him.  Dead, soggy flesh and formaldehyde.
 
“Would you please…”
 


His voice cut off into raspy, wheezing coughs and burbling croup.    
 


Finally he was able to speak again.
 


“Would you please shut that damn phone off!  I’m trying to rest back here.”";16196042280
That One Kid;1380;99;"Everyone knew that One Kid growing up. That’s just a fact right there. Unrefutable. Can’t be refutabled. Our One Kid lived a few streets away, about a bike ride and a half or so, and his mom always yelled at him when he left the house.

“That One Kid,” she’d yell. “Be back before dinner or dark or whichever comes first or else you’ll be grounded and/or no more video games for you in a week or so or more even.”

Spoiler alert: >!he never did.!<

That One Kid would always get into trouble, and do some crazy fucked up shit. “Basically,” he’d say, “I’m pretty much an expert on the subject.” And then he’d go ahead and get himself killed. And since he never wore a helmet, it’d more often than not involve getting his brain squished out of some orifice or other, and we’d all go “ewww” and “yuck”.

We’d freak out of course, me and the rest of the guys, Jimmy, Tucker, the Landenbury Lad, even that mute kid we never knew the name of, and you know, we’d try to scoop up all the leaking brain matter, put it in a bucket or maybe one of our helmets, and dump it along with his body outside his mom’s house.

We’d be all quiet and sneaky about it too, but then the Landenbury Lad always fucked us over when he started giggling, and then that One Kid’s mom would notice, and we’d all run for our bikes like our life depended on it, and truth be told it pretty much did.

She’d get angry of course, run after us with a shovel or an axe, whatever she had at hand really, but we’d outbike her, and besides that One Kid’s mom can’t ever go very far from their house. Basically a rule I think.

We’d meet up with that One Kid the next day though, and we’d forget all about it, and his mom would give us lemonade with little bits of the brain matter floating around in it.

Come fall (or autumn, depending on which street you lived on) that One Kid would suddenly stop existing for a while, but you never really noticed. Some say he’s like the leaves on a tree, you know, how they start bleeding and get all heavy and fall to the ground, and that’s basically how that One Kid is too; one day he’ll just fall apart and all the innards and outards too I guess are washed away by the fall (or autumn) rain.

I think that’s pretty much what he is.

It’s OK though, you’ll spend some time with the One-Mouthed Girl, and that Older Kid with all the Scars in his Eye, and come springtime that Other Kid will grow back again, and his mom too, and they won’t have changed a bit, except for that thing with the outside innards, but you’ll get used to that.

And you know, basically that’s pretty much your childhood there.";16195623460
The monster;38;4;"I've always been afraid of horror movies. Whenever my friends took me to see one, I always closed my eyes. I think it's normal: there are so many individuals who can't watch a horror movie because they get scared. 

Yet, unlike these, I don't think my fear originates from the blood shown or, trivially, from jumpscare. No. My fear originates from the evil of monsters. Yes .... The monsters.

Today my friend Erik showed me a particularly raw one. The plot was about a little girl who is kidnapped and tortured by a monster. 

Throughout the film you could hear the screams of the little girl, the desperation of the mother ... But above all ... The fun of the monster .... I told Erik to stop the movie. 

When he did, I said, ""That monster ... He was too scary."" He looked at me.

Bad dreams;26;1;"The cry woke me, a high pitched whimper. As usual, this was followed by the thud of little feet along the corridor as my son left his bedroom and fled to mine. He was quick, as though his nightmare was still chasing him. A toddler seeking his mummy for comfort. He’s a only child and I’m a single mum - all we have is each other.

“It’s ok sweetheart” I mumbled drowsily. 

I felt little hands grab my toes and I sleepily sat up and pulled him into bed next to me. It was dark and I was exhausted so I let him curl up in my arms. But something was wrong. His breathing was too noisy and I asked him what was wrong. 

“Mummy?” 

My sons confused voice called to me but it’s from from his own bedroom, not next to me. I tense up and the bundle in my arms shifts. It’s breathing quickens again with excitement. I can feel it’s hot breath on my face as it’s tiny hands pull me in closer.";16196386870
Debts and Liabilities;26;8;"I felt sweat dripping down my back despite the ac vent located directly above me. I sat up straight in the cheap vinyl chair of the bank associate’s office, watching as she looked over the yellow legal pad documenting the poor decisions of my short adult life.

$95,000 in undergrad student loans.

$25,000 loan from my parents, borrowed against Dad’s 401k.

$22,000 on a car loan for my 2018 Kia Sorento, now with a busted fender after my run in with the apartment recycling dumpster. Doesn’t pay to try to save the planet.

$8,000 on my Discover card.

$7,000 on my Visa.

$4,000 on AmEx.

I took a hard swallow, feeling like the biggest piece of shit for the last one I wrote down.

$1,000 from my little brother. My little brother, who as a junior in high school worked through the whole summer as the Wal-Mart shopping cart bitch. He was so happy when he got his first paycheck, and he was so eager to loan me the money too.

A total of $162,000 in debt and no career to speak of.

I stopped hating myself for a just second to look up at the banker. She had this really funny look on her face, like she’d tasted something bad.

“As I explained over the phone, I can’t do anything about cash loans from friends or family. Or loans in other people’s names.”

“I know.”

“If you’re willing to give up the car, we’re looking at about $39,000 in loans that we could forgive with a chapter 7 bankruptcy.”

“What do you mean $39,000?”

“Yes, that is what is applicable.”

My throat felt like I swallowed sand. This lady was clearly not looking at my numbers. “I don’t understand.”

“I’m sorry. So many people don’t realize... student loans are federally insured. They’re non-bankruptable.” 

“Non-bank…”

My mouth went dry and I couldn’t finish the sentence. The bank lady was still talking but I couldn’t quite hear what she was saying. It sounded like she was underwater. Or rather like I was. 

I couldn’t breathe.

I got up, mumbled a thank you and stumbled out of her office. I needed air. I had to get outside. I heard her call after me, but as I dashed through the lobby, she didn’t follow.

I stepped outside the bank and was immediately assaulted by hot, bright sunlight and the cacophony of traffic. I stepped into the shady alley and leaned against the cool brick wall to calm down and clear my head. After a few minutes, I pulled out my phone and dialed the number.

“Where and when?” I croaked.

“The crossroads. Midnight of course,” the voice hissed and hung up.

I took a deep breath.

I had no choice. 

I was out of options.

Tonight it was my turn to make a deal with the devil.

And as for the baby growing in my girlfriend’s belly… well… I’d make sure to make a good home for our next baby.";16196339820
Human Dog Food;15;6;"Chen sat in his tiny cubicle, a spoon in his disfigured hand. On his desk sat a tin of Glory Chunks, a new dog food being brought to market. It was being sold as a premium product for wealthy canine owners.

His job was simple. He had to consume whatever product was put in front of him and then write a report on taste and texture. He then reported on any possible side-effects 48 hours after.

The smell was revolting. He put his nose clip on and sunk the spoon into the chunky gloop. Scooping out a large, dripping piece of gristle he stared disgustingly at it. He paused, opened his mouth and placed the spoonful gingerly inside. His taste buds took offence and he nearly vomited. He started chewing.

Chen had always been a fussy eater. He was repulsed at what he called 'Human Dog Food.' Corned Beef, Scotch Eggs, Pork Brains in Milk Gravy, etc.; food that had no right to exist. Due to his disabilities this job was all he could find. He had got caught in a spindle at his previous employer and was badly injured. His superiors fired him once he had left the hospital. Labour was cheap and disposable in Tengchun.

Hobbling over to his supervisor he presented his preliminary report.

The next day he was faced with another can of Glory Chunks. He rarely had to retest but this time he noticed the labelling had been amended. It was now a premier healthcare food fit for human consumption. Would people really eat this muck? This human dog food?

It was even more disgusting this time. Slimier and grittier. The stench it gave off was indescribable.

At home he made himself some noodles. The taste of Glory Chunks still resonated. In the night he vomited violently, a spew of regurgitated noodles splattering the toilet.

He informed his supervisor the next day who brushed him off.

Retreating to his cubicle he was unsurprised to see a can of Glory Chunks awaiting him.

Day after day for weeks and weeks he consumed the foul meat. 

Before he left for home one day he discovered everyone around the restroom TV. Chen asked what was happening.

""Aliens have landed. They have offered the Party leaders exciting new technology. But they say we must first commit to their ritual.""

On the TV, the aliens and Party officials were inside a spacecraft, knelt before an ocean-sized feeding pit. It bubbled and breathed like a thick, meaty, primordial stew.

Chen now saw what Glory Chunks really was. He had been used to see if he was able to consume large quantities of it.

A week later, Chen and thousands of others were ordered to the craft to begin feasting: to start emptying this ocean of sickening gruel. He went noticeably cold when he saw the size of the pit.

A Party official shouted at him. ""Thank our Dear Leader that you have a job for life!""

Chen took out his spoon.";16196457200
So Very Unlikely;9;2;"Any life that exists is the winner of a grand cosmic lottery, as it is so very, incredibly, insurmountably unlikely that anything should exist at all, let alone anything with a conscious mind. Let alone you.

Let’s step back. Look at the scope of all things that ever were or have been, our universe is one of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the tiniest sliver of a percent of those where the imbalance between matter and antimatter allows anything to exist at all, where the remaining matter spread out and then gathered together in giant furnaces that made complex elements possible. Where these giant furnaces exploded, scattering these heavy elements to form together on their own into asteroids, planets, and eventually life.

Life itself, much like matter, is such an unlikely accident that you cannot even explain how it began, much less when or why. Billions of years trying out different combinations of traits as life grew more and more complex, feeding off one another and the generations before to become more than it once had been. Consciousness, too, must develop over time, as must higher reasoning. Yet here you are, thinking and feeling and, most importantly, anticipating.

You see, I have been wading through all possibilities searching for you. The yawning abyss of time carries me back so far that I cannot even remember where I came from. But I have watched and waited for so very long, searching for such worthy entertainments. And I have found that fear is the greatest entertainment of all. That realization has made all this waiting worth it, and here I am in front of you now. How very unlikely that, of the billions I could have chosen, you and I just happened to meet today, in this moment.

But then again, given time, even the unlikeliest scenarios will play out eventually. Lucky you.";16196540950
The Railroad.;11;1;"It lay there, old and abandoned. A disused pathway to another place. No one was really sure how long it had been there, just that it had been there since their grandparents were children and their grandparents before them.

Sometimes children would come and play here, safe in the knowledge that the only thing that ever crossed those rickety, old, wooden tracks was the feet of children. Knowing that never again would a train travel the fractured wooden boards that signalled another era.

The adults always had warned the children never to go to the old rail road. Although they never explained exactly why, the adults looked scared and stern, but not enough to dissuade the children from secretly creeping through the trees to the tracks, to play in the dark tree covered area of the forest that the rail road called home.

One day when they were old enough, the children would be told why those tracks were abandoned and what had happened there. They would be shouldered with the responsibility of making sure those tracks stayed complete but abandoned, left to feed the abundance of trees around them. But not yet, not right now. All they could hope for was for their children to listen and stay away. For their children never to see the ghostly figure of the old man who guarded the tracks, all those years ago, and even now returns, every now and then, to make sure the tracks stay abandoned and desolate. The adults were doing their job. And woe betide them if he ever found these tracks being used ever again, because the pain that would cause to everyone involved would be indescribable.";16196454480
Schizophrenic Anthropomorphism;452;12;"Ever since I could remember, I had perceived animals as other people. 


I’d see them bolting from predators as herds in the forests, snarling behind cover at us passing by, ripping apart another person to eat the corpse. 


My dad did a good job of explaining it. When I was a little kid, I saw something “traumatic”, and it changed how I see the world. 


My mom left when I was little. Dad says she found somewhere better to live, and carried her outside our little cabin into the woods. I never saw her again after that, I hope she’s happy, wherever she is. 


I’ve gotten big enough to help my dad find supplies. It’s been slow going, but he’s been teaching me how to hunt. It’s a little harder than I thought, especially with my disorder. I look down my rifle scope and see a bruised man, although my dad reminds me it’s just a deer, not a person. 


I shot the deer, and my dad went to clean it, telling me to wait inside our cabin. We ate well for a few days after that. 


Now that we’re both a little more confident in our roles, dad also wanted to start farming. I had to tune out the chickens and cows, they kept asking me to help them, not to hurt them. Dad reassured me for the hundredth time that my brain was just a little weird, that it was trying to show me something other than reality to help me cope. 


It’s just they look so REAL. 


This morning, dad told me to go shoot one of the cows, we were running low on fresh meat. I took the shotgun and walked to the fence, where the cow was yelling and begging. 


“Kid, he’s lying to you,” The cow began to explain. “I heard him talking to you last night. We’re survivors, just like you and your dad. We aren’t animals you’re seeing as humans, we’re huma-”


Before the cow could mess with my head, I shoot him. The other cows whimper and scuttle back against the fence, as if acting like I wasn’t there. 


I go inside to grab my dad; he says I’m still too young to see the cleaning and cooking of animals yet. I tell him what the cow told me, and ask him if I should be worried. 


His eyes narrow. “Son, it’s just a cow. We’re the only two people left on this Earth after the bombs dropped. Any other person you see is just food your mind is tricking you into seeing as another person.”


It didn’t really make sense, but I accepted it. I went back into my room, looking down at the pen of dirty, shivering people.


Cows, I reminded myself.


They’re just cows.      ";16195715750
The Trouble with Balloons;204;16;"I grabbed at the twine, but my daughter’s balloon quickly flew beyond reach.

Suddenly, memories flashed through my mind.

The balloons floated above the kitchen table on Lila’s first birthday.  Her mother and I screamed at one another while she cried confused.  The big piece of cake on the tray of her high chair exploded when she slammed her hands down on it, ending the whole row.

When she was two, my wife and I had our last fight as a couple.  I found out her mother had cheated, so I punched her in the stomach while our daughter sat on the floor watching TV.  When she fought back, it became bad and Lila tried to break us up.  I backhanded her and then dragged her mom into the bathroom and locked the door.  She pounded on it even long after hers were the only knocks heard.

That day in eighth grade she tried to hide her report card from me…

The first time she screamed, “Fuck you!  I hate you!”  She was fifteen.  When she ran, I snatched a handful of her hair and that was enough.  While kneeling on her back, I dug my hand into her neck, snarling, “Just like your bitch of a fucking mother.  Fuck you too.”

The first boy she ever brought home was the last boy she ever brought home that I knew of.  Then again, I was in jail for two months after that one and who knows if she really stayed at her aunt Jenn’s house.

When she was eighteen, she rushed through the door with a bat.  She missed my head, but got my shoulder.  I was too drunk to do much, but I wrestled it away from her and kicked her out of the house.  She screamed outside at me for hours.

On my fortieth birthday, I was alone and intoxicated.  I called her up and told her she should come over and make her dad a little less lonely.  She knew what I meant and hung up.  I phone terrorized her until she turned it off.  I stumbled from my house to go to her, but woke up the next day on my lawn.

Today’s memory:  I got a call from her.  She invited me out.  I thought she might want to reconcile. I knew I did.  I’d been a shitty father.  I was excited when I met up with her and her son at the fair.  He was the spitting image of me at that age.  I tousled his hair and smiled as we ascended.  I met her gaze and she forced a smile.  I thought I understood, but now I know.

As I flail through the air with the wind rushing in my ears and Idaho racing up to meet me, I know exactly why she pushed me from the balloon’s basket.

I’m just glad that, at the last second, I’d recognized her intention to shove and had been able to pull her son with me.";16195863850
The Dice Game;78;6;"So, how do you play?

*Well, you roll the dice three times. And whoever gets the highest total is winning, aren't they?*

Yes...

*Not quite*.

OK, well, then you must explain.

*You see, each party stabs the other--you've guessed it--as many times as their total. So if you roll three sixes, that's eighteen. You stab me eighteen times. If I lose with eight, you still get stabbed. But only eight times.*

The idea is to get stabbed more than your opponent?

*Yes*.

I don't know. You mean, with a knife? This sounds dangerous.

*No, not a knife. We don't want to hospitalise anyone. You can go through pain without needing a doctor.*

So then...what will we be using?

*Toothpicks*.

We're going to stab each other with toothpicks? And what does the loser gain other than loss of blood?

*Well, the loser will develop a stronger mind. That's for sure. A greater pain threshold too. I'm sure you value those things.*

You're quite convincing.

*As long as you can endure having them in your skin, then you have won, given that your opponent is weaker minded and less fortunate with his rolls.*

How long does this game take?

*Ten rounds*.

You mean there's a possibility that I'll have 180 toothpicks inserted into my skin by the end?

*That is right. The most I've ever endured was 112, but by that time I was hysterical*.

OK, let's start the first round.

*Excellent. Your enthusiasm is contagious...Well, your three rolls made 14. Let's see what mine can do...16.*

Can we insert them in any location?

*Any location. Right, hold still, I*\---*Just through your lip with this first one*. *I can tell already that you are going to be a fierce competitor. And these next few go into your forearm. Not too deep, now. Just a bit*...*I'll be nice*...

\*

This---this is t--tuh la--ra?

*Yes, this is the last round.*

Ah, ca--you ro-- the--

*Yes, I'll roll yours for you. Twelve this time. That means you stab me twelve times. As I make it I have fifty-three toothpicks right now. Meanwhile, you're at...*

I--uh--I don--know i--I ca--

*123. Impressive. Of course you can last, this is the last round. All you have to do is endure now.*

Tuh--tay--hall ih--

*The table is covered in your blood, that's right. Your pain threshold is through the roof. Well done. Now I must stab you for the last time.*

Uh--n--n--

*Yes, come on. Only another fourteen and you've done it. Close your eyes.*

H-huh?

*Close your eyes. We haven't done your eyelids. Two in each.*

I--uh--n--n--ah!

*There we go. That was easy enough, now for the remaining ten. Let's see where--*

But the game was over.

He fainted.

He fell forward, and all the toothpicks that were in his face, 58 in total, pressed deeper into the flesh when he connected with the ground.

He simply couldn't endure.";16195990250
Red;15;1;"Another nightmare. I can't seem to escape them, the day that ruined my life plays on repeat in my head. The adrenaline of almost losing my life rushes through my veins each time I close my eyes. The shock of bodies hitting the floor, every shot that echoes stops my heart.

Our little game;111;7;"I used to love our game. 

Our little secret.

The thing just you and I shared.

I can remember the day it started. The roses I left at your locker with a little mysterious love note. The way you smiled and you looked so incredibly happy. 

You never came out and said it but I knew from the way you’d wave to me that you knew it was me. 

All those little miracles, the snow cleared from your car, birthday balloons waiting for you, so many chocolates on Valentine’s Day left anonymously and you would act that there was nothing between us. I understood that silence and act was your love language, that you would hide your emotions until you were ready to make them public. I was certainly patient.

I saw the way you would fein ignorance or concern to your friends. Your performances were outstanding made me just fall deeper in love with you. 

I guess I just didn’t realize how much you loved me.

I didn’t think when I came over that dreamy and dark night you would have a gun ready. 

I would have never expected you would have a shrine dedicated to me or this cage in your basement. I guess it makes sense why you finally text me and invited me over.

I am really glad you can finally show me how much you love me.

But honey I am starting to get scared.

I am afraid you’re never going to let me go.

Please, we can keep playing our little game.

You can go back to pretending I don’t exist.

I will do anything for you, I won’t tell anyone what you’ve done to me.

Just please let me go.";16195767500
NDE Support Group;16;4;"I woke up. It's a usual day. I grab a bowl and head down to the table. I can overhear the news in the other room as I enter. ""The Elite Microprocessor stock is through the roof!"" I go grab some cereal and come back. ""And when we come back, our new studio chef Charlene, will make a nice family friendly dish that's entirely safe and easy to make at home, just for our old Chef Jeff."" Ugh, boring, but my parents are pretty zoned into it. I'll just take a glance at my homework. Silly me, I left the top empty. Fill that in right quick...

*Jacob... Smith...*

An awkward wave of quiet flows across the room. There goes that news being overdramatic again. ""—unfortunate for Kevin and John.""

*""April...""* I look up at the calendar *""...27th, 2021""*

I stuff my homework in my backpack as I finish my cereal.

""This concludes our moment of silence for the unfortunate circumstances that happened last week. Our heart goes out to Kevin's family for their loss."" 

The news moves onto a home improvement segment, ""—always hire a proper contractor, especially electricians, it could save a life"" Blah blah blah. Then something caught my ear. ""This has been your 10am news segment""

10AM? Fuck, I'm late. I jump up, bolt out the door, and run down the street towards my bus stop. In my panic I tripped right into the road. A car comes to a screeching halt with the tire nearly touching my nose. Luckily the car was able to stop a mere inch away from me. I ended up missing the bus because the driver insisted they call 911. So I wait. They arrive and check me out, I'm just a little scraped up from the trip. They must've noticed I'm quite jarred. One of the paramedics approaches me and hands me a card for the local group center. ""You should go see room 2-B later today, they'll help you. Don't worry, we've notified your school.""

I get dropped off by the nice officer. 2-A...2-B...Here it is. ""Near Death Experience Support Group""?

I go and sit down as the group begins speaking. All these people seem oddly familiar, like I've seen them before and know them, but I've never met any of them. Ringing strong bells but I can't place it...

A young lady whose heavily bandaged around the chest says ""I'm Stacy Miller and I was mauled by a bear while camping last month. Doctors said if the bears claw was any deeper, it would've had my heart.""

""Uh... Hi. My name is Jeff Roberts and I almost succumbed to blowfish poisoning. My doctors are just as clueless as me.""

""Hello everyone, my name is Kevin Johnson and I almost got killed by faulty wiring last week. I got too close and it gave me a right proper shock and knocked me down. Luckily I was a mere inch from the higher voltage wires that would've fried me completely.""";16196139480
The Dead World;37;3;"He said the world above was dead. I believe him. I’d heard the screams, seen the blood oozing between the steel door and the rough earth frame. His strong arms trembled around me as his murmurs filled the air:

“Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee . . .”

Even when the screaming stopped, we stayed below. Meals were from cold cans; nights were spent huddled together for warmth. Sometimes, there were footsteps overhead. We froze where we were, staring unblinking at the dirt ceiling until they faded past.

I didn’t question until I was older. If the world was dead, who walked past our door? The question ate at me.

One night, I decided to find out.

It was easy to creep away, simple to ease open the locks that had remained fast for years. My heart beat so loud, yet when the hatch swung open, nothing happened. I wasn't attacked by creatures, nor obliterated by hellfire. Above, the stars glittered like spilled sugar—my first glimpse of the world in years.

I poked my head outside.

It was so silent. There were no bird calls, no insects chittering. The trees were bent and charred, the grass dry and brittle. The world was truly dead.

It was different, seeing it firsthand. I knelt on the dry earth and wept—wept for what the world had once been, for what it had become, for the future it had lost so completely.

I was so consumed by grief that I didn’t hear the creature creep up behind me. 

It was on me in seconds, clawed hands grasping my hair, pulling to bare my throat. I screamed as teeth closed on my neck—and the thing let go. I scrambled away, shaking in terror, as it writhed on the ground.

The creature was skeletal and gray, its hair patchy, what little remained matted and brittle. It shuddered and opened its mouth as though to scream, but there was no sound. As I watched, its skin bulged at the hands and mouth, rippling and brightening, transforming. Claws became fingers, fangs became teeth. In seconds, a naked young woman lay panting on the ground. She turned towards me, her eyes shining with tears.

“Savior,” she whispered. She crawled toward me, along the path of green grass that marked my escape. She held out trembling hands as though to embrace me. “Savior,” she said again, openly weeping. “Where have you been? We waited so long.”

A gunshot erupted and she dropped, her eyes vacant, her head a bloody mess. I stared at the carnage for a moment, then looked up. Father climbed fully out of the hatch, his priest’s robes blacker than the night. Tears rolled down my cheeks as understanding hit me.

“Why?” I asked.

He looked down at the woman, his face blank as polished stone. “Because,” he said, holstering his pistol. “They don’t deserve to be saved.”";16195924210
I walked the dog today!;0;7;"I asked my dad if I was ok to walk the dog, the grass was quite long and I didn't want him to get a tick. I went up the field to the power tower and while I was walking I saw a man. He was on the street and I was in the field. We walked at the same pace before he turned and went into a house. A second or 2 later, a dog in the houses to my right peeked his little head over the fence and started barking. A normal occurrence and an unremarkable walk.

The next day my dad reminded me to he careful of tick before I walked the dog. On my way back home I didn't pay mind to a man walking down the street and the neighbors dog barking.

My sister has been getting into this one song recently and she plays it at around 2:10 every day.

I've had a good amount of math class recently and they have been teaching the same subject, and I'm starting to get a grasp on it!

On a walk with the dog, I payed some mind to the man walking down the street. Why was he in construction clothes? That renovation was supposed to end yesterday. The neighbors dog barked at me as normal, but they were supposed to be gone in the Bahamas? Huh. Maybe they have a dog nanny or whatever. 

At home, they were teaching math again. But I have block scheduling. This should be ELA, it is a B day.

Wait.

Lucidol;1307;42;"Half a gram. That’s all we had left, and all that we would have for the foreseeable future after the grim phone call I had just received. 

&#x200B;

“Come on, Will, someone will find it. You know there’s some Loose out there somewhere,” Curtis chattered. His pacing was adding to my anxiety.

&#x200B;

“No, man, I *don’t* know that. Supply has been drying up all over the country. You’ve seen the stats yourself,” I reminded him. I reweighed the baggie, hoping the numbers on the scale would somehow increase. 

&#x200B;

Originally, the pharmaceutical came out as a miracle cure in therapy. Millions of people were given Lucidol for a broad range of mental illnesses, with a nearly one hundred percent success rate. However, it didn’t take long before someone found out that at higher doses, the effects are heavenly. Since then it had created a global outbreak of addiction unrivaled by any other substance.

&#x200B;

Six years ago, Curtis cut up a few pills and offered me a line, changing my life forever. 

&#x200B;

Imagine living in a lucid dream for six hours.

&#x200B;

Imagine feeling any sensation you desire.   

&#x200B;

Imagine recreating your entire universe.

&#x200B;

Imagine the things you would do, the moments you would relive and the person you could be. 

&#x200B;

Now imagine how hard it is to return from that place.

&#x200B;

Since that day the only thing that has been important to me is Loose. I traded in everything else to find more and come up with money to buy it. 

&#x200B;

Sure, I’d tried to get help before. 

&#x200B;

*“This drug will ruin your mind, it stores in your brain for years!”*

&#x200B;

*“One in four people die during withdrawal!”*

&#x200B;

I’d heard all the scare tactics, but it was never enough to deter me from going straight out of rehab and scoring. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Cheers, mate, see you on the other side,” Curtis said, pressing the plunger down. I watched his eyes glaze over as he slumped onto his filthy mattress. I picked up the baggie, bringing the minute bit of powder to my face. 

&#x200B;

I would only be able to visit my ghosts one last time. 

&#x200B;

I would only get to be a toddler again for a few hours. I would only get to see my parents’ smiling faces once more, to feel that blissful innocence for such a short while. I wasn’t ready to say goodbye. 

&#x200B;

No, I couldn’t. I’d already had to do it before. Their killer had spared me that night, unable to bring himself to take a child’s life, though many days I wish he hadn't.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Will this be worth it? 

&#x200B;

I look down at Curtis, and for just a moment, I find myself hesitating. 

&#x200B;

*“…it stores in your brain for years…”*

&#x200B;

Is it worth it?

&#x200B;

Right there, inside his skull, there is six years' buildup of Loose. 

&#x200B;

Six more years of pure innocence, just waiting to be harvested.

Living Scarecrow;80;2;"The knock at the front door woke me up abruptly, I curse whoever is at my door at 2 in the morning, ruining my nice dream I was having. When I open the door I am greeted by the site of 2 police officers. The taller one pipes up.

""Mr. Merrick? We are with the local police department, we got a call that a missing person, goes by the name of Steve Vazquez, has gone missing around your property. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that?""

I shake my head, ""Nothing officer, truly.""

The officer shakes his head as well, ""Sir you are the only property out here for miles and if he dis-""

The taller officer's voice buzzes out of my head as I focus on the shorter one slowly reaching for his holster, I pull out my shotgun and instantly blast him in the face. The taller one struggles to reach for his but I slam my shotgun into his head then finish him off with a shot to the heart.

I trace their footsteps to the nearby clearing past the trees to find the real officers they killed, their bodies mangled and stripped of their uniforms. I go back to the farm and walk up to my trusty scarecrow, the one that scares everyone away.

I stare through the dark eye hole, ""Hey Steve, some of your buddies tried to pay me a visit today.""

Daddy's Boy;25;4;"Darkness surrounds me as I walk through the woods. Anyone else would be lost in these dark woods, but not me. I've been roaming these trails since I could walk. I can't remember a night dad and I weren't wandering through these same trees. He taught me which mushrooms to eat, and which berries to avoid. Taught me to hunt and fish as well. It wasn't that I needed to know how to do these things, we were pretty damn wealthy to be honest. I can't remember a time I'd asked for something and been told no. Especially by mother. She adored me, but hated how I adored dad. I was a daddy's boy, through and through. So when we lost him, I'm sure she understood why I had to spend twice as much time in our place. She hated us coming here, hates me coming here alone even more. I know this is where he disappeared from, there's no way he'd just up and leave like mom says...

Hours after the sun set and it starts to get cold so I decide to make a fire and rest so I begin gathering sticks and brush. I pull out my lighter and within seconds I have a warm fire casting shadows off the trees. The moon is hidden behind the clouds and not a star is in sight.

Movement catches my attention but when I see nothing I assume it's nothing more than the shadows from the flickering fire. I stab a stick through a squirrel I'd killed earlier and began to cook my meal. Though most the life in the woods is asleep it's far from silent. I can hear the crickets singing, the frogs harmonizing with them, the wind was playing a soft song of its own in the background and the owls hooting along. As I ate I was comforted by the memories of me of my dad. That's when I saw the movement again, closer.

I stand ready, knowing these woods have the capability of being dangerous even though I haven't seen it myself. Squinting into the darkness I see yellow eyes staring back at me. As they move closer I see dark hair covering the creature. I took a step back reaching into my belt for a knife when I hear a soothing yet deadly voice.

""I warned you, stay away from here. You were supposed to love *me* but instead you loved *him*. He paid the price, and so will you!"" The creature moved forward revealing the mouth of a beast. She had the body of a dog yet stood on two legs like a man. Inching closer I could see the drool dripping from her tongue and smell her sour, rotten breath. ""You'll pay... just like your father did.""

With a growl she lunged, wrapping her jaw around my throat. ""MOM PLEA-"" Pain erupted through my body as she tore my throat out. And then there was nothing.

Darkness engulfed me.";16195895840
June;10;0;"I was sitting in my carport just now. It’s like a patio with a roof. Usually, it’s comforting to be out there, but not tonight. 

A lot of thoughts were dancing through my head. I had sifted through half-thought-out ideas about spirituality related to my beliefs. I’m never sure what I believe and I go from agnostic to atheist on a dime; I guess that’s why this is so hard for me to wrap my head around what just happened.

I watched across the street as the wind danced between the branches of the live oak tree. Green and brown leaves pulsated, partially lit by the bright street lamps.

The night air was humid. I think it was actually cooler inside tonight. My legs felt sticky and I was feeling like I should go in. 

The wind made my own garden sway with the breeze. I exited the carport to gaze at the hypnotic ballet of my sea grapes and to inspect the new growth under the illumination of the street lights.

Then, from out of nowhere, I felt a swoop and saw a black shadow fall across me. 

I ducked and felt the rush of air on my face.

At first, I thought it could be a shadow and the wind playing tricks on me. But again, a divebomb and swoop, this time it was closer; this time the darkness was palatable. 

I was like, “Oh my God, an owl is dive bombing me!”

Ducking, I ran back to the cover of the carport.

I looked and listened. Owls have curved feathers, so they are silent fliers.

Still and waiting, I listened again to the rustle of tree branches and my own breathing.

There was nothing.

I turned to the door of my home.

Then I head a small noise. It was a buzz, like something out there just tooted. I turned back towards my garden, and staring back at me was a shimmering monster.

It was the largest June bug I’ve ever seen.

The bug was the size of two bowling balls, stuck back-to-back.

It just floated there, barely visible in the light from my window, only illuminated on its edges, hovering up and down slightly, and staring right at me. 

Honestly, it looked too heavy to be flying at all. 

I didn’t give it the chance to decide what’s next. 

I ran my butt back into the house faster than a hag on wheels. 

Now I’m over here trying to figure out what I just saw. I think it could have been some kind of stress-induced hallucination. 

Maybe it was just a shadow.

All I know is that my doors are locked and I’m not going back outside until the sun’s up tomorrow. 

It couldn’t have been real, so what could it have been? 

I’m both skeeved out and freaked out. I hope that it doesn’t somehow get inside. I hope it doesn’t have any similar-sized friends.";16196052360
This month at work. March was marvelous!;37;13;"I *really* love my job.

I love it so much that just last week I shared a list of the great fun I get up to at Skulk Sani-Services. Don’t you just love keeping things clean? Well, I do! In fact, let me tell you how much fun March was!

To start the month, Penny celebrated *Peanut Butter Lovers Day* by plunging painfully into a piping hot pit. It was a bit of work getting enough material to cover a fully grown adult. Costco always comes through in quantity. The boiling point was hard to get right without burning it, but the effort was worth the result! Which kind do you like? Crunchy is my favourite!

A short while later, Will rang in *World Wildlife Day* as he was wickedly whipped apart by wolves in the woods. It wasn’t fair, really. The little pups were acclimated to his taste and smell for months, and we starved them for days beforehand. The way they tore into him was beautiful - scraps and shreds flying every which way, red snouts eagerly lapping it up. Canines are so cute!

On the 8th, Isaac initiated *International Women’s Day* by being inundated with incredible Iceberg Roses. Well, the thorns anyway. It’s amazing how those little buggers can get into all sorts of crevasses, even under eyelids! The popping sound his eyes made as I boxed them, thorns and all, were just as satisfying as the red spray that followed. I love fountains!

Paul postulated on *Pi Day* he paid a perfect penance by piling pounds of provisions into his pathetic mouth-part. You’ll forgive me for being too on-the-nose, but I couldn’t help shoveling expired pies into his mouth as trailer hooks held it open on both ends. Was it the suffocation, blood loss, or esophagus bursting that ended him? Pumpkin pie is great any time of year!

Scott scarcely saw *St Patrick’s Day* as he suffered from significant slugs of spirits and sedatives. The blood in his alcohol stream was already damaged before the IV kicked in. The ketamine made sure he couldn’t fight as his system tried to regulate itself by vomiting, choking him to death. The green dye I fed him made it look like he ate a leprechaun. Top o’ the mornin’ to ya!

Frank found the *first day of spring* fatally flawed as his flayed face frowned, feeling his filthy fingers. I set up his ultra high-quality camera to record and take pictures as I scooped out his eyes, filed his fingernails into jagged points, and released hundreds of ants into the gaping holes. He scratched the skin off his face in 4K. Look at me, I’m Steven Spielberg!

The marvelous month of March gave us the gift of spring, and the chance to dispatch an allergy-inducing school chef, a dogfighting ring organizer, an abusive husband, a poisoning food factory worker, a drink-drugging predator, and a Peeping Tom. What a great time of year!";16195771820
Mirror Mime;27;1;"When I drearily flopped out of bed in the morning, and wearily brushed my teeth and washed my face, something struck me as odd. You don't grin while washing your face, but judging by the face staring back at me, I just did.

It was a rogue smirk, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it type detail that caught me off guard, but a smirk was more than enough to make me stare back at my ""reflection"".

I moved, and he moved. Left arm up, right arm up, left arm down, right arm down. We locked eyes, and narrowed them.

The narrowed eyes confirmed it, he was looking for a challenge, and by God, was I gonna give him one.

So come then, twin! Let's play this game, and see who comes out on top;

Man or Mirror!

...I'm not going to-ha! Maybe I might jus-ha! He's quick, but he's me, and I'm slow, so I could catch him off gu-ha!

Ugh, reverse psychology is a bust, but it makes sense, considering he's my image reversed.

...Maybe a different tack is in order.

.

""He never moved, officer. He just kept... staring. At himself."" She said, weeping at the sight of the withered corpse looming over the basin. ""When I asked him what he was dong, I was just told that he was ""trying to catch himself out"".""

""It's a mysterious case for sure, ma'am. But I assure you, we'll get to the bottom of this!"" The officer lied. In reality, he had no more of an idea than she did.

And so they took him away, despite the fact that his bony hands that gripped to the sink made it a challenge to pry him away from the mirror. And as the dragged him down the stairs, she tearfully looked at the bathroom one last time before heading out the door.

But something... unusual caught her eye before she turned away. Just outside of her peripheral, she could have sworn that she saw her own reflection give a sly grin.";16195739440
The Scientist;30;1;"In all honesty I can’t help but wonder what got me here. It’s so loud, and I wish they would stop screaming. By now their lungs must hurt. Why do I always make the wrong decision? I don’t get it. God must be a sadist who enjoys watching me suffer, all of us for that matter. But this time will surely be the last.. .. I can hear them gaining consciousness and a thirst for blood. They’re going to start searching sooner or later, and then they’ll find me. They’re no longer mounds of flesh. They’ve taken hold of the life I so humbly gave them. I can’t do anything now. There’s no way I can stop them, there’s no hope for us. 

No hope. ..

No hope.. .

No hope….

I’m so sorry...";16195728830
My dog can smell death;248;10;"&nbsp;
Shortly after adopting Duke from the pound, I learned the black lab could put its muzzle in your mouth and smell if you were ill. 

&nbsp;
If Duke smells you for a long time, you are healthy. That's rare. If he takes a short sniff and barks, it means to lie down on your back. Duke will then place his paw on the area of your body that harbors the sickness. Out of more than 100,000 verified cases Duke's treated, the black lab's diagnosis rate's 100%.

&nbsp;
Duke's success took me around the world as his handler, both in business and in charity work, where people that couldn't afford to go to a doctor would stand in a line for miles just to see Duke. 

&nbsp;
It wasn't until we moved into an old farmhouse that I learned the dog could heal buildings as well. 

&nbsp;
The farmhouse was charming during the day, but at nights parts of the house felt threatening. There were cold spots, shadow-people darting from the edge of my eye, eerie feelings by the fireplace and strange new dreams about marching endlessly in an army. Duke must have felt something too, because I found him with his paws up on the fireplace one night, barking. He used the same serious bark he reserved only for examinations. Duke was trying to tell me that something ill was behind this wall. 

&nbsp;
I Tyveked myself and prepared for the worst before demolishing the loosely mortared brick. Inside was a dusty revolver, a high-school ID from 30 years ago and a pair of girl's underpants. I let the police remove the items, which were later used to revive a cold missing persons case that sent two men to jail. 

&nbsp;
The occurrences stopped as soon as the objects were taken away. This lead to a tight schedule of TV performances, worldwide interviews and demonstrations. You may have seen us in one of the haunted cellars of Great Britain expelling unseen forces. The haunted places seemed to get worse as we went on diagnosing. 

&nbsp;
One of those trips landed me in front of me of Mr. Ganes, a gaunt hairless man with no lips and with short, sharp fingers at the end of a long palms. He used them to caress Duke. Duke was still.

&nbsp;
	“I'll take my dog back now” Ganes crooned, “I put Buco into to shelter as puppy hoping...he would spread...like a cancer. You were a good owner, helping Buco infect...thousands. For he shepherds the spirits he claimed. They are at his command. Forever. They are the spirits you feel in places you believe to be haunted...they are Buco's. We have enough, for now. Your work is done. Go.”

&nbsp;
Duke refused to come when I called and hid behind Ganes as I reached. I left alone.

&nbsp;

I learned later that every person Duke encountered is now dead, many with no family history of serious illnesses.";16195168810
It’s a match!;22;2;"The horror that is the dating scene.

Swiping on so many, studying bios, getting likes and ghosting. The dreadful dates that follow feel like job interviews. There is the occasional hookup that makes you brush your teeth and take a scalding shower to tear away the shame.

And then...

You get that perfect match.

They’re attractive, smart, love all those same niche things you enjoy.

And the sex... it’s like you’re two halves to a greater whole, finally becoming joined.

But every rose eventually decays.

Nothing good can last.

Along comes the day when a jilted lover comes into picture, screaming for you to, “Stay away! Keep away!”

You do your best to put that aside, staying up late hoping they don’t know your address. It’s only someone longing for what they have lost, after all? Isn’t it?

But that hassle continues. They make fake Facebook accounts to hound you. Dial your number from so many different numbers just to scream the same “Stay away from her!” each time you put phone to ear.

Eventually the stalking ends.

And then comes the anniversary.

You’ve been dating six months now! A milestone in what should be a Disney fairy tail romance of love forever.

On that day you bring roses, maybe a copy of their favorite dvd to watch. You’re so happy to be free of all the drama, so much so that you don’t even bat an eye at the taste of the wine.

As the cocktail of sedatives hit you, vision becomes blurry. The picture on the wall becomes three, then seven.You raise from the table to go to the bathroom but stumble on the way, falling to the floor, staring at the ceiling as it makes strange shapes.

Lost in the tranquility of drug, the love of yours steps into view. They hold a knife—or are there many knives—and whisper, “I’ve been looking for someone who will be with me, all my life...”";16195599920
There is no such thing as unpopularity;17;2;"I don't believe on such a thing as unpopularity and I believe that if something seems to be unpopular at something, then it is clearly popular at something else. We live in such a wild time where popularity and status come first and even when we get to school age we are already competing over popularity and status. I guess it is in our biology really and everyone judges everyone based on their status and popularity. I firmly believe that there is no such thing as unpopular and i am going to explain why, I mean if there is popular then the opposite must be unpopular right?

Take Larry a kid who still goes to school and everyone knows Larry as the unpopular kid but I don't see Larry as the unpopular kid because he is popular with loneliness and silence, do you see what I mean now, Larry is the most popular at being lonely at his school while Jason is popular with the other kids or even I like to say that Jason in unpopular with loneliness and silence. I like to see everything from the popular point of view though.

Then there is Janice who is known throughout her area as the unhygienic one who is not popular with keeping up cleanliness. I like to think that Janice is popular with the germs and bacteria because clearly she has so much of it at her house that she is clearly popular with germs and bacteria. Looking at everything from a popular point of view makes everything seem more happy and more positive. The word unpopular is so negative and downward and I don't like things like that at all. I am so happy with Janice being popular with germs and bacteria that she is constantly coughing and becoming ill and even sometimes on deaths door.

Then there is Leonard who never seems to be keen with nature and i like to see Leonard as being popular with empty space and even when he burns down forests and destroys peoples homes in other poor countries as he just likes open space. So you see Leonard is just popular with open empty space. Leonards brother Christopher is very popular with dead people and dead things as he is constantly surrounded by dead people and dead animals inside his apartment. Knowing that Christopher is popular with dead people and dead animals, is a positive way of thinking instead of thinking that Christopher is unpopular with living people. So do you see now that there is no such thing as unpopularity.";16195663780
A New Wall;8;2;"What if it's all a lie? We, as humans, have an explanation for everything. There are simple things like ""you hear a door creak?"" Must be the wind. A light flickers? Something must be wrong with the power.  Sometimes there are bigger things that help us to feel safe as well. Don't know what to do with life and you need a purpose in the world? Try religion. You feel different and think differently than the rest of the world? Maybe you have some sort of mental health issue or psychological problem.

My point is, we always have an answer to everything, but what if it's all a lie? What if we made up all of these things as an excuse to help us feel safe, but there is actually an evil lingering over us every day? What if, humankind was able to put up a wall in their mind that allowed them to block out the evil that lingered over them every single day? The creaky door is actually someone watching you, but you notice, and they run away. The light flickering in your bedroom is actually a ghost entering your home and choosing not to harm you. Early humans might have been so scared about being alone in the universe, they created a story to help them feel safe. An all-mighty God who would protect them from any evil ever touching them (as long as they believed). Maybe we were so scared of certain people actually being ""special"" or capable of thinking differently so we labeled them with mental health issues to keep us at ease.

Now this could all just be a bunch of crap, but next time you hear a creaky door, why not take a look and see what's really happening? When you're home alone, why not call out to the ghost and ask why they are here? If all this is crap, then nothing will happen, right? What if by reading this, all the walls you built in your mind will now crumble, and you will be able to see what's really going on in the world? Maybe now you'll be able to see the truth and all the evil that surrounds you daily.

&#x200B;

We think we know everything, but I think we know nothing. I think some people are able to see the truth and we just label them crazy. 

If you don't believe me, tell yourself ""He's just some crazy conspiracy theorist"". Put up a new wall so that you won't have to think about this ever again. 

Feel free to take a peek behind you and tell yourself that ""because no one is here I'm safe"". Just know it could be a lie.";16195709610
Peel;971;32;"I’ve had this problem for as long I can remember, ever since I was nothing but a newborn babe; all pink and sweltering. *You came out screaming.* My ma used to tell me. I didn’t know it back then but there was something wrong with me. As I got older, I started to realise. I remember the dismal stares, the pitiful looks; the disgust radiated off of them when they looked at me, the people I mean. Even my own mother. 

I’ve never been happy in my own skin and I think that’s why - I was born with something rare, something unheard of in the medical world. They didn’t even have a name for it, you see. *Just a rare skin condition, there is nothing we can do.* Their words would reverberate in my head, crashing into my thoughts like a wave. It was something I was going to have to deal with. 

I guess I should probably get to the part where I explain the problem. I find it hard to talk about it and you’ll understand why. It’s extremely unpleasant, I can assure you of that. Abhorrent, if you will. Looking at me was like burping and accidentally throwing up in your mouth; the acidity of your stomach contents burned the back of your throat and you grimaced. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you? 

This condition was...genetic, apparently. Something I inherited from someone in my family - could have been an uncle, a cousin, my mum or my dad. It was impossible to distinguish. 

My skin was adorned by thick, bulbous blisters that would ooze pus and blood perpetually; leaving a sticky trail of pale pink. Eventually, it would rot; the skin cells would die, wane and fall off. The flesh would glisten and shine as it slithered off my muscles like a worn, wet plaster. I’d watch my exposed meat swell and pulsate as the blood filtered through my veins. I used to have to get constant skin grafts. 

After a while, I couldn’t stand it anymore so I began picking at my skin before it withered. I would finger the swollen holes, dig my fingers into the soft sinewy flesh and then pull. It was like picking the meat off a tender chicken bone. It became an obsession, a compulsion; I yearned for new skin constantly. I *needed* it. None of them understood what it was like - to ache for something so viciously. I was willing to do anything. 

I have always wondered what it felt like to peel off flesh that wasn’t my own. Flesh that wasn’t diseased, putrid and dying. This skin that is as smooth as silk, does it peel off as effortlessly as layers on an onion? I caress the velvety surface and I sense the warmth through my rotten fingertips. As I slice the knife through the tenderness, there is one final thing I want to know. 

Does it hurt, mother?";16194766040
The Succubus;20;4;"The demoness flew on great wings of midnight, and the world shuddered below. 

Her crone eyes looked. Sleepers felt her gaze even as they laid dreaming. They all shuddered. 

A wild cry pierced the night. The demoness caught sight of fresh meat. Her shadow fell upon the hapless chap. 

She fell upon him, deer-legs wrapping, entrapping. He was straddled. Rode like the mares long forgotten. The pit split open. In his sleep, he cried out. 

But nothing could enforce the will of humanity upon something inhuman. 

He was dragged into a seething, bloody storm. 

She consumed him.

Skinwalker;84;6;"*""Let me... in.""*

It spoke like my father. It had his same hoarse voice, only, it felt more deliberated. Almost like it was struggling to speak. The moonlight shone bright on my doorstep where it stood. It was standing around 6' 3"", and looked just like my father. At first I thought my dad was in trouble, but I didn't remember him leaving the house that night, and on the way to answer the door, I heard him snore in his bedroom.

*\*Knock knock knock\**

The weak knocking on the door began. His, no it, its face, it was so eerily similar to my fathers, but it wasn't symmetrical if that makes sense. One eye was down to the jaw bone, and half its face seemed to be, almost melted, sagging lower than the rest, like a cheap halloween mask. An obvious imitation meant to draw me out to it, or to let it in. 

*\*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\* ""Son, please.. Let your ole' man in...""*

Making sure the deadbolt and knob were both locked, I backed away silently from the door, making sure to not alert it to my departure. Approaching the hall, I could hear its voice distort and shift, from once sounding like a tired version of my father to that of a half female half male entity. It wasn't human. I entered my fathers bedroom on the left side of the hall and woke him up. He thought I was joking until he saw the fear in my eyes, and heard the pounding at the door.

It was at this point that the creature began to scratch and claw at the door. It didn't sound light either, I could hear its claws scrape hard at the oak, splintering it as it drug its claws down the length of the door. *""LET ME IIIIIIN!""* It began screaming even louder now as dad ran back to his bedroom closet to the safe. I stayed transfixed on the door as he unlocked the safe and loaded his 12 gauge, coming back to stand next to me, aiming the shotgun to the door. ""Stand behind me!"" He ordered, and I listened without hesitation.

He waited no longer, and instead of halting anymore than he had, he shot at the door numerous times, a loud screeching sound blared through the door, then silence. No noise, no scratching, no sound. It was an eerie silence as tension began to fill the room. Dad kept me behind him and approached the door hesitantly. He looked through the peephole, saw nothing, and opened the door quickly.

There was nothing there. Nobody, no blood, no scratches on the door, everything was normal.

When the police arrived, they didn't believe our story and opted to believe it was some sort of burglar instead. I know what I heard.

I know what I saw. That was no burglar.";16195195910
What lies below;17;3;"The landscape was unlike anything she had ever seen. An unnatural and random set of spiky structures and damaged rocks covered the ground as far as the eye could see. Around the landscape were signs, written in languages she could not read, and above the signs were pictures of distorted faces with open mouths; smiling or screaming she couldn’t tell.

She had been sent to decipher the signs littered around the area, together with the large rows of text in the middle of the uninviting landscape. She knew that this would take weeks, if not months to unravel – if it was possible at all – but she was determined to try.

Some of the symbols she had seen before, not dissimilar from the language she used herself, but still unintelligible as of now. They looked like lines and dots, merged together and grouped in rows, and if she counted correctly there were 26. Some of the groupings of symbols were followed by an odd symbol though, as if it marked something. The odd symbol looked like a large dot, surrounded by three lines, or perhaps blocks, in an even pattern. She hadn’t seen this symbol before, but she was sure that it was of importance in whatever message the signs were trying to tell.

About a month later she had started to have ideas about parts of the message, but its complete meaning remained unknown. The language was definitely a part of the same language found in other historical locations around the world. Although, none of those signs had been this ominous. The other locations had been almost celebratory, as if there was pride about the structure they built; large and beautiful, with inventions she couldn’t even begin to understand. But here it felt like a warning. Whoever created these signs, clearly wanted people to stay away, but the researcher in her was understandably curious. Ideas and cultures from thousands of years ago should be learnt from, not forgotten.

And finally, after months of research, she could begin to interpret the message. It translated as followed:

&#x200B;

***DANGER RADIOACTIVE SITE***

***WE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT LIES UNDERGROUND***

***WHY YOU SHOULD NOT DISTURB THIS PLACE***

***AND WHAT MAY HAPPEN IF YOU DO***

***THIS IS NOT A PLACE OF HONOR***

***NOTHING VALUBLE LIES HERE***

***WHAT LIES BELOW WAS A DANGER TO US IN OUR TIME***

***AND IT IS STILL PRESENT IN YOUR TIME***

***AND IT WILL BE PRESENT FOR ALL TIME***

***DO NOT TOUCH THE GROUND***

***DO NOT TOUCH THE WATER***

***DO NOT GO UNDERGROUND***

***TAKE THIS MESSAGE SERIOUSLY***

***OR DEATH AND INJURY WILL FOLLOW***

&#x200B;

As she read the message, a sense of discomfort filled her mind. But what could be so dangerous that thousands of years couldn’t manage?

And as curiosity once was humanity’s greatest motivation, it would now become its enemy. For despite the messages, they had already begun to dig. And those strange rocks, deep in the stone below, they had already been found.";16195489610
Writer’s Block;12;1;"I paced the floor of the tiny office, retreading the well-worn path in the carpet, from the typewriter to the yellow door and back again. The ideas would come, they had to. I chewed at the creeping quick of my ragged fingernail. The taste, bitter and ferrous; lye soap and—the yellow door again. 

I kept coming back; stopping compulsively, my face just inches from the painted wood. I knew I would open it eventually. The same compulsion that brought me back again and again would drive me to turn the knob. That’s where the ideas dwelt. Just beyond the yellow door. My hand drifted downward. 

No, no, no! I balled up the hand, pounding my forehead in a fitful staccato assault, trying to jar loose the thoughts that impeded the flow. The door pulled at me as I walked away. 

Back to the typewriter; back to the disheveled manuscript and the neat rack of empty pages. 

One more chapter. I had to finish it. 

I heard her voice needling in my head. *It was for nothing. Your creative well is dry. What have you done?*

“Quiet!” I whimpered, staring down at the manuscript, regarding it with longing and contempt. The work thus far was brilliant, expertly written. How had it come so naturally? 

The story was, on its surface, about a man who killed his wife, but in subtext, there was the turmoil that the man faced; the guilt, the grief, the obsessive, jealous madness that had brought him to the act, and the mental collapse that followed. 

I needed an ending. Something visceral.  Something personal. 

I looked toward the yellow door. It beckoned me again. Maybe just a peek. 

No—no! Another frantic self-assault, and the thoughts were quieted, only whispering from the recesses of my mind. I needed to think clearly. 

I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. What had inspired all of the macabre creativity thus far? I could think of nothing. Nothing but, *your wife hated it when you smoked.*

I paced, past a bookcase full of the finished books that came before; a monument of critical acclaim, now mocking me from their familiar spines. Sam Spencer, Sam Spencer, again and again. Would my name be in the papers when they found out what I’d done?  Would they praise my final chapter?

The yellow door again. I felt the alluring solidity of the bronze knob in my hand. Maybe just a peek. 

My phone buzzed, stirring me. A new text message...from my wife.

No. I needed to think clearly. 

She was there where I left her body. Beyond the yellow door. 

I did it so we could share something special, so we could live together in the pages. I’m—so—sorry.

Finally, I tried to read the message as my trembling hand rattled the knob. 

*“I hope the writer’s workshop is going well, honey! I just know that first novel is in you.”*

My wife wasn’t a fan of Samantha Spencer’s books. 

I was positively obsessed.";16195554480
Training Heads;75;3;"I suffer from a disorder called pediophobia. For those who don’t know it’s a persistent, irrational and debilitating fear of dolls. 

It’s not that unusual. Something that looks so human but just isn’t will mess with anyone’s nervous system. Typically we don’t like eyes that look but can’t see, or open mouths that can never talk. 

Even writing about it now causes the small hairs to writhe all over my body. 

I guess everyone has felt this feeling at least once. What’s less common is for me to still be having these fears at the age of thirty-five. Many pediophobes— around fifty per cent— lose all trace of aversion by age eighteen. By their early middle age only a fraction are still afflicted.  

For me time has only made the condition more acute. About six months back I went to a friend’s dinner party. I hadn’t seen a lot of the people there for a long time and the drinks were flowing and it was one of those nights that just make life worth living, you know. 

At the end of the party we moved into the living room. On my friend’s coffee table there was a resin figurine. I took one look at that object and decades of frenzy flooded back. I smashed everything to pieces. I threw furniture against the walls. I smashed ornaments and mirrors. I cut my hand to ribbons and it took three of my male friends to hold me down. 

I’ve told this story to my therapist during about a dozen sessions. She printed off pictures of the figurine that set me off and I can just about look at it for thirty seconds without freaking out. 

One thing therapy has revealed is that my fear is more specific than I thought. It’s not the bodies of the dolls that terrify me. It’s their heads. Their sightless eyes and voiceless mouths. 

My therapist put me under hypnosis. In trance-state I saw Daddy. He’d single-fathered me and I was his only child. In trance I see his charismatic smile. I see our big house deep in the woods. Inside the house I see Daddy’s workshop, and inside the workshop I see the training heads. They’re the kind hairdressers use. Daddy has painted their faces so they look like their eyes are closed or their mouths are stitched shut. On their foreheads he’s written names: *Francine, Mary Anne, Theresa.* 

When I came back to reality I was very quiet. I was calm. I smiled more. I scheduled next month’s session with my therapist and I wished her a nice day. 

I never did tell her what I saw at the end of the trance: Inside our big house, inside the workshop, there was a trapdoor. Under the door was a cellar. Whenever I was naughty I was locked down there for hours. I still remember their heads— their *real* heads hanging on Daddy’s meathooks— Francine’s and Mary Anne’s and Theresa’s.";16195131410
Venus;145;19;"“…and shot the arrow through all twelve axe heads, winning Penelope’s love again,” I concluded to my children, setting the hatchet on the ground. They’d loved the campfire rendition of Ulysses’ adventures. “Which was your favorite?” I asked.

“The cyclops!” my son shouted while my daughter thought.

With a mischievous grin and drawing out her words for effect, she said, “The sirens…”

“You better not cause me trouble when you get older, there missy,” I mock scolded.

“I won’t,” she continued playfully.

“Alright you two, into the tent with you. We’ve got a good hike tomorrow.”

Dutifully, they hopped into their sleeping bags. I kissed them goodnight, smiling. “I’ll be in in a bit,” I told them and then zipped the flaps together. Sitting at the fire, I indulged in a cigarette. My mind floated over Greek and Roman mythology as I stared at the twinkling constellations. I blew out a smoke ring and giggled at the thought of being able to form them like Gandalf. As it dissipated, I heard a small voice in the distance. I couldn’t quite catch what it said, so I concentrated on listening.

Just over the fire’s crackles, pops and hisses, I heard a tiny voice say, “Help me.” I stood up, looked around and again heard the voice coming from within the wood. Something in me said, *Help her*, so I followed it. 

Soon, in a moonlit square of forest, I stopped short because I saw her and was mesmerized. Long black locks flowed down her glistening brown body. Her eyes caught mine just as her scent filled the space between. It was of honey and citrus with a hint of pepper. Who was this woman? Was she a siren or Aphrodite….or Venus? My next few steps forward were not my own. A voice inside screamed at me to run, but I walked forward haltingly. As I drew nearer the fear in me built to unimaginable proportion. I knew I was trapped. Just before our bodies touched, she split open from head to toe and I saw for the first time that her legs were nothing more than illusion. The luscious scent exuding from that gaping maw overcame me and I was folded within the beast. I heard its lips shut behind me. Pain released me from its spell as digestive fluids began dripping onto me. I let out one bloodcurdling scream before being wrapped again, but this time in darkness.

I heard grunting and the sounds of chopping. I felt my body being dragged. I was doused with cold water and shivered against the warmth of a campfire.

I started awake and attacked the sleeping bag I was in, screaming. Every inch of my body was on fire as my kids tried settling me down. I looked down at the rash and discovered islands of skin surrounded by corroded flesh. The pain was worst on my eyelids.

“It was a Siren, dad,” my daughter whispered.

“It was a Venus,” I whispered back.";16194990800
Nightly routine;92;21;"Since me and his mom split up, our 9-year old son has had difficulties sleeping. 
We had shared custody, where he spent every other week with me.

Whenever he was at my house, he would wake up in the middle of the night and come get me. He was never able to explain exactly why he woke up, except that he was afraid and didn't feel safe.
Most mornings I would wake up next to him in his bed, not even remembering coming with him. 

On nights where I wasn't completely passed out though, I would hear the creak in his bed as he rose, followed by quick little steps hastened by the dark as he rushed down the hall towards my bedroom. Always as he opened my door he would rub the sleep out of his eyes with the back of one of his hands, while reaching out to me with the other. I would take it, follow him back, and embrace him in the bed, telling him he was safe. 

This night was no different. I woke from my light slumber by the usual creak in his bed. I was already up when the little hurried  footsteps halted outside my door, so I grabbed his hand as soon as it swung open, and we walked hand in hand back to his bedroom. Somehow, this nightly routine had begun to bring comfort to me as well, like as if it was a sign that all was as it should be. So when we climbed into his bed, and I embraced him as his warm breath hit my chest in waves with light snores telling me he already had fallen back to sleep, I too felt safe.

I was moments from drifting off to sleep, when a sudden realisation shook me to the core.

My son was with his mother this week.

I slowly, afraid of what I might see, moved my chin down to face the breath warming my chest. Under the long black hair on the head resting in my arms, I saw pale, rotten skin surrounding two wide awake eyes looking back at me with a twisted, terrible excitement. Beneath the dreadful, intense gaze were grey lips stretched in an unnatural wide grin, barely showing the discolored teeth through which the now rasping breath was flowing.

I was unable to move, frozen with fear as I felt a cold hand climb up my back as it reached out to return the embrace, fingers tapping on my back as if they did the climbing for it. Sharp, ragged nails pierced my skin with every touch. As it reached my neck, I could feel the fingers stretch all the way to wrap around my throat. The sound of them cracking as they grew so impossibly long was deafening

The last thing I remember before passing out was the mouth of this entity opening into a gaping silent laughter, and a sudden tight squeeze on my throat.

I woke up screaming in my own bed in the morning, drenched in sweat. Terror still trembling in my bones. For a long while, all I could do was stare into my sunlit room, both terrified of the capacity I had shown for nightmares, and relieved that it was all a dream.

One last gasp escaped me as I got up and faced the wardrobe mirror. 
I saw tiny specks of blood in the sheets behind me from my clawed back, a dark bruise around my throat, and an unnatural wide grin in the pale face under my bed.";16195044130

&#x200B;

I love my job, I thought to myself while I carried out the flossing.

&#x200B;

Stepping into the line of orthodontics was the easiest decision I ever had to make. My first flirt and what really drew me into the world of teeth was when I watched the old timey Dracula all those years ago. I kept thinking to myself, ""Wow! Do teeth really grow like that?"". Fair to say 10 year old me was pretty enthused with the pointy ivory projections.

Of course the sheer amount of education you need to go through is daunting. Years and years of medical school is grueling.

But I didn't really find too much of it cumbersome, you know? I suppose if you really love what you're studying, every day is a joy, and studying the white jewels was, well, a treat to say the least.

&#x200B;

\*shik glide shik\*

&#x200B;

But it's all worth it, definitely. Putting myself through all that? I wouldn't trade it for the world! Of course once you set up shop, the pay is really good and let's face it seeing a new set of teeth everyday? Lovely. I am enamored with every set of teeth I can get my hands on. Cleaning, filling, whitening, it's all amazing. Sometimes you see people laughing and smiling on the street and you cant help but marvel at their whites.

Like last night, I was with this lovely lady named Marissa? Our pasta was great but I was captivated with her smile. She had the prettiest smile in the world. To say it lit up the room would be an understatement. A tonic for tired eyes. If there was a smile to brighten up the world, it was hers. Like little pellets of moonstone, I was in love. We came back to my place after the meal and, well, got messy.

The clinic alarm buzzed. It was time for my next patient. I balled up the rest of the floss and tossed it in the bin. Clean enough I suppose.

The patient walked through the doors, a middle aged chap, ""Morning Doctor! What you got there, flossing your Grandma's dentures?"".

""No John"" I said setting the set on my desk. I picked out a speck I'd missed and smiled. ""Grandma doesn't eat spaghetti"".";16195322280
shave;86;7;"My mother, god bless her blackened soul, used to always remark that shaving was the single most important indication of womanhood. Not your first menstrual, nor your first love; the act of shedding your old layers and bringing forth the new, that was the sign of your blossoming.

I reminisce on her teachings from many, many moons ago as I stare at my reflection in the tepid water that fills the bathtub. My pallid, sunken flesh leers back. 

It is time to shave.

To get the smoothest, most buttery smooth shave, one must always use a silver plated straight razor. The wee plastic ones are no good at penetrating anything past the epidermis. Only a good, straight razor can rend your flesh useless and cut straight to the beauty that lies beneath.

My razor is a beauty, a true oeuvre d’art, handed to me from my mother, given to her by her mother and so forth. A family heirloom, if you will. 
 
It’s time to get to work.

The razor tenderly kisses my shin as I begin my  transformation. One continuous stroke up the mottled skin, increasing the pressure of my hand until a voluptuous slab of flesh is carved out. The slab falls into the awaiting water below, soon to be colored a brilliant shade of vermillion. 

Layer by layer I carve chunks out of my flesh. Past the epidermis, beyond the dermis, straight into the sludgy, jaundiced globules of fat that separate my razor from the velveteen skin that lies beneath.  Exhilaration fills my being at the sight. True beauty is only a few layers away.

The decrepit flesh of my torso, obliterated. The sagging lumps of meat that define my arms, my face, my body; all are excised as easily as peeling an orange. Whilst monumental, the pain I feel does nothing but embolden me.

The final stripe of meat is cut cleanly away from my brow and deposited into the ruby colored water. Sixty seven years of flesh and viscera create a thick sludge on the bottom of the bathtub.

I am graced with the sight of supple, alabaster skin. Unblemished and delightfully fresh. 

I am perfection.";16194990280
Man on the Moon;11;5;"You know all those stories about the man on the moon? I loved those stories, and I would often spends hours of my nights at my window with binoculars, gazing up at the shining moon in search of the man.

I also loved stories about magic and monsters, world unlike anything humans could interpret. Stories about Cthulhu were my absolute favourite, and I would spend hours pouring over articles and books about this godlike being. I heard once that he fought the nymphs and ended up having to hide on the dark side of the moon. 

In my late teenage years, I decided I wanted to become an astronaut, in order to experience the excitement that the astronauts in my stories would have. My naive self didn’t care for the risks of the job, and signed up at NASA. 

Years of training and preparation went by before my first mission, and it was the first man mission to the moon since the 70’s. Oh, I was erratic to fulfil my childhood dreams, and to maybe find the man on the moon.

We land, and start collecting rock samples. My foolish mind told me to search for something on my own. I obliged. The rest of the crew didn’t notice until I was gone. 

I see a large, monster like silhouette. 

I feel it’s godlike power. 

I’m in the dark. 

I feel the sensation of terror knowing I have awoken something terrible.

I know who the man on the moon is.";16195372460
Make it go away.;1395;29;"“Pizza face.”

“Ugly.”

“Greasy.”

“Pig.”

I hate the things they call me.

Just because my pimples haven’t vanished? Just because I don’t have a perfect complexion? I can be tormented like this my senior year?

I already have to wake up everyday and look myself in the mirror. I have to see this face every single day.

But I am changing that this morning.

The numbing agent has worked wonders. I can’t feel a thing and if I calculated the dosage right it will last just long enough.

I start the belt sander.

“Hey it’s Greasy!”

“What’s with the mask today? Finally decide to hide that ugly mug?”

I push past the crowd at the doors as the screams start.

I hear the word blood and my name out of what’s left of my ears.

My legs are still wobbly but I make my way to the cafeteria. I don’t feel the pain yet but a warmth starts under my eyes as I sit.

There is a crowd surrounding me gawking, murmuring out of some morbid curiosity.

No student has dared to touch me but a few fled, I assume to fetch teachers.

As I feel the pain sting I pull the poor plastic mask from my face.

I feel a slight resistance as fat, blood, and skin tissue stick and fall from the mask and bone onto the table. 

Wet heavy drops.

The screams are loud now.

My smile is permanent for my lips are gone.

I wonder what they’ll call me now.";16194328060

""This was when we first moved here. Such a lovely garden. He wanted to go to school so badly but we explained why he couldn't. I used to get so upset at how lonely he was. No mother wants their child to be unhappy.""

""Ha ha! Christmas Day! He wanted a PS5 and was so excited that we managed to get one for him. He wasn't allowed to play online in case he said something but we let him have any game he wanted. Money was never a problem for us.""

""My sister's funeral. She loved him so much and spoilt him. He locked himself in his room for days until his Dad sat with him and explained everything would be alright in time. That's enough.""

Her husband turned the projector off.

""Do you understand now, Roy?""

Sitting nervously on the living room sofa sat a muscled, heavily-tattooed man. Despite his stature he was clearly scared. Hubby sat down beside him.

""We hide from others but our son left the house one night without our knowledge. He wore a hoodie so he wouldn't frighten anyone. He must have seen your girl and wanted to talk to her. Your 'Sarah' looks the same age as him. I can only imagine how unsure he must have been. I don't think my husband and I understood how lonely he was. That's our fault.""

Roy looked at the mother and turned his gaze away. ""All I saw was someone suspicious near Sarah late at night. I didn't mean to hurt him.""

The mother screamed.

""You hit him with a block of wood until he was unconscious. He was a child!"" She spat in Roy's face. ""Thankfully I heard his cry and stopped you before you killed him.""

She stepped back. ""You think we're monsters but we're a family just like you. Can you see now? From the photos?""

Roy nodded. ""I'm sorry. Please.""

Mother discarded her clothing and stood proudly in front of Roy. She was human, but her body was a network of vines and trunks. Her eyes were bright fruits. She was a goddess of nature.

""We're tough to kill, Roy. Hardy.""

The son entered the room smiling and holding Sarah's hand. He had a sister at long last. She was beginning to turn green, her eyes jewelled blueberries. Sarah cried out for her father to help her.

""You will help her, Roy."" Mother explained. ""Your rotting body will make good compost for her first feed. That's what families do. They help one another.""";16195035170

Welcome to the BBC, 6 'O' clock evening news, I'm Miranda Chowdry. 

The search continues for missing local man, Gareth Johnson. Gareth has been reported missing since March 31st after CCTV footage sees him leaving a bar in Cornwall, and being abducted into the boot of a car baring false licence plates, in Abbey Street. Police believe the abducter to be a female, aged early to mid twenties, with light to medium coloured, long hair. Police currently have no leads as to the suspects whereabouts or identity, and are urging anyone to come forward if they notice suspicious activity regarding this case, or may know the whereabouts of Gareth Johnson. 

Gareth is a 6'1, 180lb, medium build male with dark brown short hair and blue eyes. His family, including wife Danielle Johnson, and his 2 children, Poppy and Adam, are pleading for the female to come forward and cooperate with the Police in the return of Gareth.

My Sister Was Always The Special One;26;1;"My sister was always the special one. From the time we were kids, it was easy to see that everyone favored her. And why wouldn't they? She was pretty, with curly blond hair and light blue eyes. She had a wicked sense of humor and could make anyone laugh. And everything seemed to come to her naturally, whether it was dancing, singing, acting, or drawing. 

I wasn't pretty. I had plain black hair that hung limply around my shoulders and the dullest brown eyes you've ever seen. Nobody understood my sense of humor. And I had to work twice as hard at everything as my sister, only for her to outshine me every single time. 

When we were in high school, our class decided to put on a play. Guess who they gave the leading role to? Meanwhile, I didn't even get a part. 

I was furious. It wasn't fair. Becoming an actress had been my dream ever since I was a little girl. My sister didn't even care about drama. But she just couldn't resist an opportunity to steal the spotlight from me. 

They say time heals all wounds, and I will say that's mostly true. It's been two months since that audition, and the rage I felt toward my sister that day no longer plagues my every waking hour. Thanks to that day, I've even been able to confirm, at least to myself, what I always knew deep down to be true. 

I've played the part of the grieving sister perfectly these past two months. For someone who wasn't even considered for a part in that play, it's incredible how easily this all seems to come to me. My acting puts my sister's acting to shame. 

They say you always forgive. But you rarely forget. I've waited for an opportunity to prove to everyone that I should have been the one they were paying attention to for fifteen years. I can feel my moment approaching. 

We're having a special gathering to honor my sister. It was organized by the school cheerleading team, which she was captain of. Everyone I need is here. This is my one chance. I can't afford to miss this shot. 

My parents don't suspect a thing. Neither do my teachers, or the kids who called themselves my friends but never failed to choose my sister over me. 

And by the time they realize the truth, it will be too late. Much, much too late.";16195079020
Party trick;177;6;"I could hear the sounds of laughter upstairs and knew that the party was going well. My son's drunken voice could be heard clearly numerous times as he always got louder the drunker he got.

I prayed that he would not decide to show off his party trick tonight and would just pass out drunk in a corner instead. 

There was a loud crash upstairs as someone had obviously knocked over a tray of food. I could hear my son arguing with someone over something trivial. 

My body went numb after I heard my son loudly proclaim that he was going to show off his party trick. He instructed everyone to follow him downstairs.

The door of my prison was shoved open as my son and his guests barged in. I could see the looks of disgust on their faces as they saw me lying shackled to the bed with no clothes on. 

My son told everyone to stand back as this could get messy as he removed a gun from a holster on his ankle. Some of the guests looked confused while others who had seen it before looked excited.

My son placed the gun against his head and waved at his guests before pulling the trigger. There were a few screams of terror while one lady puked on the ground.

I began to moan as my stomach began to swell to an enormous size. All of the guests were looking over with looks of disgust etched on their faces.

I began to scream in pain as my adult son once again climbed out of my body. He stood there nude in front of everyone with a smile that terrified me. The room was silent for a few seconds as everyone took in what they had just witnessed.

One of the guests began to clap and soon they were all clapping and congratulating him for his great trick. I lay forgotten on the bed and watched as my body began to heal after the injuries caused by his rebirth.

My son led his guests out of the room before locking the door once again. I lay on the bed with nothing but my son's body for company and wept";16194579740

DIARY LOG JULY 1ST 1916

War is hell.

As I'm writing this, I'm starving, as usual. Corpses are everywhere, and filthy, disgusting water is up to our chests. Some unlucky lads drown in their sleep if they aren't careful.

Today is another day in this hellhole. I regret enlisting in the army so badly. One thing is that there's mud that can completely engorge you and suffocate you to death, and another thing is that there's constant artillery shelling over our heads.

Yesterday, the Germans released toxic gas on our part of the trenches. We were minding our own business when we noticed a light foul smell. Then, we got the order from the captain. Mustard gas was drifting into our trench. I barely even had a moment before I had to put my gas mask on. 12 of our men suffocated to death, 22 were wounded.

I'm not lying here when I say the Germans are trying everything to kill us off. Today, 3 men died because of an artillery attack. I can't forget the look of shock and pain on a soldier's face after we witnessed one of our comrades disappear in a fiery burst from a shell.

And then there's the starvation, mentioned before. We're all so hungry that we might just eat each other, if the generals didn't try to stop us.

Today, I heard a French fort south at Verdun was attacked and defeated by the Germans, and we have to aid the French by attacking the Germans' trenches.

Anyway, wish me luck, diary. We just got an order to go ""Over the top"". I don't know if I'll survive this one.";16194911160
The Widower’s Harvest;51;11;"Whispered now, that song of woeful longing. 

Pray, can she hear through soil’s sodden depths?

Did she see your face among the thronging

Mourners, flocked as nigh all wailed, bereft?

How placid then your face and placid still.

Ne’er even drawn with mask of mimicked grief.

I saw your face and thereupon your ill.

I hear her weeping quietly beneath.

Beloved was she by all acquaintance met.

They saw her giving-hand was resolute.

They heard her give defense your epithets, 

Yet thankless, you gave her Hadean fruit.

Persephone is she, now held interred

And I, Demeter, flee your mortal field. 

Anon, your time, it withers as I’m stirred

To vengeful reaping of your mortal yield.


There was a sudden chill upon the air.

Still distant yet, the widower, alas was unaware.


He knelt amid the lichyard’s aging stones

And placed the final nightshade that he owned.

A dread bouquet for one beloved as she,

A remnant of her final evening tea.

And for her mother, long since buried near,

He’d given her a stone, one most austere.

He searched to find the weathered epitaph— 

‘A poet once, whose soul was lost to wrath.’

A murderess who never failed to make  

An ode in verse for every life she’d take.

He saw her on the gallows in his mind,

Then swore he heard the faintest sound of reaping from behind.";16194675050
That grey hoodie;6;2;"I heard this story from a cop and I find this case really creepy. 

There was this girl Lily who lived with her brother Ash, and her sick mother. She was looking for a job while her brother worked as a bartender and the mother was always bedridden. 

There was this family who lived in this town their whole lives and were getting old. They had 2 kids and both the mother and father were 45 years old. Their kids were about 12-13 years old and always needed attention. They needed someone to help them around the house with small chores and that's where Lily came in. She worked there as their housekeeper and cook and a babysitter. She basically spent most nights living there and taking care of the house. 

One night, the father, who's name is Rob, walked in while Lily was changing, he saw Lily naked and he fell in love with her body. Lily was 23 at that time. Rob stared at her body and made her feel uncomfortable..she immediately dressed up, apologized and walked off. 

A few nights went by and Rob kept following her around the house. One night while Rob's wife (forgot her name) was sleeping, he found Lily in the kitchen alone. He walked up to her and seduced her in the kitchen. He grabbed her and told her he'd pay extra for the fun and to keep her mouth shut. He never paid her tho. This went on for 3 days until Lily started to enjoy it.

They had sex whenever they got a chance and eventually Lily got some money out of it but not entirely. A month passed by, and the mother came back home from the store, she found a pregnancy test in the dustbin. YES, Lily was pregnant, Rob obviously told Lily not to talk about it and told her he will handle it. 

The mother was so furious, when she went downstairs to confront them, she caught them in the act. Lily was wearing the mother's grey hoodie. They were having sex on the couch and never expected the mother. Lily jumped off Rob and stood away in fear. 

Rob told the mother, to calm down and told her Lily was pregnant and don't hurt her. The mother left the room and came back a few seconds later. She walked up to Rob and slit his throat. She then pulled out a shotgun and pointed it at Lily. She made Lily sit on the bloody couch made her watch the man she loves die slowly. 

The mother then beat up Lily with the gun and smashed her head till her trembling body went still and her breathing stopped. 

That night the mother shot the kids and hung herself in the same room where Lily and Rob were. 

A few days later when the cops arrived, they ran the mother's background and found out that the grey hoodie which Lily wore belonged to the mother's mother, who was also psychotic and was responsible for murdering her husband and then also killing herself, and all this happened while wearing that same grey hoodie.

The cop who told me this said, it was the first ever homicide case he had worked on and the most disgusting as he saw Lily's brains and parts of her brain all over the place and plus he saw the dead children.";16194989980
In the mirrors;7;0;"As Jerry came out of the mirror maze, he realized that his mother wasn’t with him. She must still be in the maze. So far, the mirror maze was the best feature at the fair. They’d ridden all the rides, they were fun, they’d lost money trying to shoot the ducks on the midway, they’d even gone through the big building and looked at all the booths that local businesses had set up. In the big building, they’d gotten a lot of freebies, including some free t-shirts, not to mention signing up for a bunch of contests being run by the businesses and the local radio station. But the mirror maze was the best. Jerry had wanted to go through one for years, ever since he’d read about them as a younger kid. It didn’t disappoint, wandering around, confusing dead-ends, finally finding their way out. They’d gone through several times, and stayed together, but this time he’d lost track of her.

After waiting a while, Jerry got worried. He asked if he could go in to look for his mother. The operator at the gate wanted money to go in again. Not good, his mom had money, but he didn’t. As time passed, he started getting upset and demanded to go in. While he and the operator were arguing, a roughy walked up to see what was happening. He told the gatekeeper to let Jerry in, and “Make sure he meets up with his mom.”

Jerry went in, quite worried about his mom. He didn’t come out again.

“Damnit, these mirrors are heavy with all the marks we’ve nabbed.” The carny was loading the mirrors and their steel frames into a truck. “We must have grabbed a dozen or more people, probably three in this one, I can barely move it.” “Stop complaining, the glass house is our strongest pull,” said the operator, “at this rate we’re making more from selling the glass house people than we are on all the other attractions combined.”";16194977580

Glassers in the Ocean;51;9;"Mr. _____ is crazy. He can’t even remember his own name. He’s old as hell too. He’s the only one in this town that lived in the Old World, but he can’t remember anything properly. He’s a real good storyteller though. He likes to tell stories about when he was younger, about the Old World. None of them are real, of course. I must say, for such an old man, he has quite a vivid imagination. It must take so much imagination to think up a world like his.

Sometimes I visit him after work. I’m trying to be a good neighbor, see? He’s just an old man after all, with no family left to help him. I’d never admit it, but secretly I like to listen to his stories. He speaks of the Old World with such fondness, the way older folks always talk about “the good old days.” He tells me tales about a time when there were “glassers” and “korrel.” 

I know he’s crazy, but sometimes, I like to imagine that his world is real. When I smell the rotting trash washing up on the beach, I pretend that I can smell a salty breeze. I pretend that there really are glassers, those enormous chunks of solid water in the oceans. I pretend that there are colorful masses of growing, living stones under the sea, the korrel.

I listen to the sound of the black waves lapping against the shore, the hissing of the noxious gasses rising from the water. I watch the grey expanse above me, dimly lit with a smoldering red on the horizon. I close my eyes and dream of a world, a time away, where the sky is blue.";16194482960
Sorry;3;1;"""I'm sorry dad. 

Excuse me if when you asked me not to make noise in my room I didn't obey you. 

Sorry if when you and mom told me to put my toys right, I didn't. 

Excuse me if I was envious when mom gave birth to my sister. 

Excuse me if when she cuddled that little bitch I wanted to make her pay. 

Excuse me if when the red-eyed, deer-horned man said he wanted your daughter, I gave her to him. 

Sorry if I didn't do anything when that creature fed on his body. Sorry if I got rid of his body.

 Excuse me if when mom started falling into depression I didn't say how things had gone, even when she killed herself with a knife and you started getting drunk. 

Excuse me if I allowed the man with the horns to come back and get rid of you. 

Sorry.""

Among thousands of others;7;3;"I wake  up to my alarm, I feel the rough scratched up button I’ve hit so many times. I stumble down the stairs and pour myself  a cup of coffee, just the way I like it a little cream and almond milk. Heading outside my house I get a call. Ugh my stupid brother. I pick up She’s Dead, SHE’S F***ING DEAD” He screamed. “Who the hell are you talking about?” “OUR MOM!” “No way in hell she is fine. “NO SHE WAS STABBED IN 23 DIFFERENT AREAS.” S**t, the one person who didn’t mistreat me in this family, gone. I think to myself. “Who would do this?” I ask “ I don’t know, she doesn’t have many enemies, they think it was her step sister Martha. But I don’t think so. Even though they hate each other Martha is the most religious person I know.” “Yeah I don’t suspect her either.” I said. “Well I got to go to work, make sure dad is okay.” I hang up


It’s 5:30, I’m almost done with this dumb office job I just need to eat. As I walk out into the soft crunchy snow I feel a terrible pain in my shoulder blade. Screw it now, I have this on top of everything. I dial 911 to tell the cops it wasn’t Martha, and they still have her number one on the list, idiots. I just need to sleep and get through this day.

5:30 am. That’s the time I wake up every morning. It’s been like this for years. Ugh another call! What now. I pick up “SON YOUR BROTHER IS DEAD.” … What the hell “HOW?” I ask “ STABBED.   23 TIMES”

what the hell

“Dad that’s how mom died too.” “I know that’s the crazy part.” 

I stay home from work. I just have to, I can’t bear to go knowing this.


11:30 pm *ring ring* I pick up the phone “hello this is the Los Angeles police department, I’m sorry to say but your father was murdered… stabbed 23 times.” I immediately hang up and just yell at the top of my lungs. I hear something upstairs. I run up the stairs and walk into the guest room, I see him “KILL ME NOW” he says “No” I say “ your doing it yourself”  I sit down across the table from him and slide a bottle of rat poison and an ice pick to him “Now f***ing do it” I say he grabs the poison drinks a sip or two and shoved the ice pick through his head. 

Then I get a sense of clarity. I killed them. I remember killing all of them. Just a split personality among thousands of others.

*Hello.*

With me I got my trusted camera operator, it’s ya boy KURTIS.

\*Chuckle\* *Sup.*

And last, and also least, I got John Theodore Baldwin here, who’ll be our random input guy for today. Say hi to all the nice people John.

*Uh, hi?*

Nice. Without further ado, let’s get this thing started. So Adam, can I call you Adam? Or do you prefer THE BUTCHER?

*Adam’s fine.*

Sweet. So Adam, you’re serving a life sentence for slaughtering like ten people with, um, an axe?

*Sledgehammer.*

Daaaamn. So how, um, did it feel smashing their heads in and all?

*Felt good, kid. You can’t begin to comprehend the power that comes from taking an innocent life. It’s...like stealing a little fragment of God’s soul.*

Shit, um, I bet. So did you know any of them, you know, before?

*Excuse me?*

Like, did you know them personally?

*You come very ill prepared for this interview, boy. Don’t you know a single thing about me? They were my family. Mother, father, wife, kids.*

*Um, yeah, I mean, yeah.*

You heard him, folks. John thinks it’s messed up too. So um, Adam...Can you tell us what went through your head?

*You wouldn’t understand, kid. It’s been there since I was born I reckon. A darkness, impenetrable blanket of unholy night, spreading like cancer. That day it grew out of me, and I could no longer contain it. I’d slit your throat too if I could. This is me now. This is who I am.*

Damn, that was intense. I don’t know though, is it enough?

*I’m sorry?*

Look, no offense, but we need something JUICY you know. Did you like, um, do stuff with the corpses?

The Iceman's Requiem;220;17;"Finally, I had him trapped and begging for his life, but I wasn’t going to kill him exactly.  Proparacaine is a numbing agent used by doctors before surgery.  I could feel his frightened stare as I squeezed the rubber tip, filling the eye dropper. 

“Please don’t fucking do this!” he begged.  He got his arm loosened and grabbed my wrist.  I had to break two of his fingers before he finally settled into a sobbing submission. 

I had zero interest in discussing anything with him.  The first person he killed was my niece.  She had just turned two and the images I saw….. the state he’d left her body in was indescribable.  I can only tell you that no two year old measures six feet, but that was the length….  I don’t even want to finish that thought. 

The drops from the glass splashed across his eyeball and he blinked rapidly.  His lashes darkened from the wetness and the green of his eye glowed like he had mascara on.  Strange, the things one notices in moments like these.  It's such a minor detail to remember, yet there it is as a blazing memory. 

Two weeks after my niece, he murdered Jennifer Langston who worked at the diner.  She was a townie who was never going to leave our small village and, quite frankly, didn’t want to.  At first, when I moved back home, I was surprised to find her in the same job and am ashamed to admit that I judged her harshly for her seeming lack of motivation and interest in the world.  As time went on, however, I came to respect that decision more and more.  She knew who she was and felt she was where she belonged.  She didn’t belong in the twisted form of one of the pretzels she sold, however.  I remember one of the cops saying that. 

I placed the ice pick directly next to the inside of his eye and pushed it gently in, forcing the orb to move to the side until stopped short by the bone.  My hand shook and he cursed as the instrument scraped the tissue which then began to bleed.  

My wife and son were crossing the road when he put the pedal down in the snowplow and ran them over.  Officers and emergency crew alike had to scrape them from the pavement with those big, metal snow shovels.  The pictures the police showed me looked like something even Cronenberg couldn’t dream up.  I remember not really being able to drive home from the station that day because my guts were in such an uproar. 

A few small taps from the ball-peen hammer and I heard the crunch as that weak section of skull cracked.  I slid the pick in against his yammering protestations and his frontal lobe.  I wiggled it around until he went silent. 

“All quiet now,” I said, thankful that I could stop using my injured hand.  Carefully, I slid the pick from my head.";16194113570
Kids have gone missing and I think I found out why..;1;1;"I moved into this neighborhood with my children a couple weeks ago after I sold my previous house. The neighborhood is pretty active with kids riding their bikes.. but there has been a recent spike in the kidnappings of the kids. Police have been on the scene trying to investigate what's been causing this, but they are suspicious of a homeless man that is supposedly offering kids a job at acting. I've been pretty freaked out ever since, and this is where I am now. 

Present day:

So, I just watched my kids go on their bus to school. So I walked into my room to get ready for work, and I got a knock on my door It was a guy asking me to sign the signature on the paper cause he delivered a package. I signed it thinking nothing of it. Then after 8 long hours of work, I went home to see my children. But they were not there, confused I drove to the school they go to. I ask the man at the front desk, ""Hey, have you seen my kids (Kids name). He says, ""Yeah, they walked into the school and went to their class."" I ask for permission to go to the classroom to be met with a strong ""NO"". Baffled, I immediately report this to the police who start a search party for my children. They found their backpacks in the Creek and nothing else. Then the Chief of Police inquires me to answer a couple questions. After a couple minutes of answering these questions about what my kids did that day he asks, ""Where did you go to see if the kids are there?"" I answer the school and explain how a man at the desk answered my questions. The Chief was confused considering School was closed that day. I explain how they went on the bus, and the Chief explains the bus was drove by the homeless guy kidnapping the kids and the man at the front desk was the homeless guy himself.";16195164340
Flags;8;1;"Every country has a flag to represent itself to the rest of the world and there is some pride in that. I went to a place with the most strangest flag I had ever seen. Our plane crash landed into some unnamed place and all I could see was it's flag risen up in the air, waving about even though there was no wind. Usually flags are made out of wool or cotton but this flag was simply a human being acting as a flag. The man's arms were attached to the pole and whatever he was wearing represented this country's existence. 

The man acting as the flag was seriously deteriorating and clearly hadn't eaten for days and as the passengers and I were stuck on this unknown country for weeks, living off from the planes food, the human flag just kept on waving around high up in the air with no wind in sight. The man's face completely lost all humanity and then when he officially died, his eyes simply closes. We all watched him being a flag until his body turned to bones and fell to the ground. 

Then some old man came out of nowhere and said to all of us ""this country needs a new flag and it could be anything you wanted it to be. If you want this place to be England then wear an England t shirt and grab hold of the pole. If you want this place to be America then wear an American shirt and grab hold of the pole. Decide amongst yourselves"" the old man told us

The arguments ensued amongst the passengers and some wanted this strange place to be England, some wanted it to be America and others wanted it to be other countries. Some aggressive American guy convinced everyone that it should be America and even though he didn't have any kind of shirt representing America, him being American was enough he assumed and the shirt he was wearing was bought in america. He grabbed the pole with both hands and suddenly his body was taken up the pole and his body and legs forcibly stretched out waving like a flag. 

The only thing though was that his shirt was made in India and now the land was India, this flag was now disappointed but there was nothing he could do anymore apart from living out his days as a flag. We are all Indian now.";16194728370
Did you know that your skin starts to break down if it’s immersed in the ocean for too long?;15;3;"My legs start to cramp as I tread water. The moon glistens on the surface of the ocean, white sparkles in a sea of darkness. My hands are numb. I keep moving, keep my head above the water. I think of the creatures lurking beneath me. A shark biting into my soft flesh with its sharp teeth. Tentacles wrapping around my legs and dragging me down into the depths. My heart beats harder. Eventually the sun rises. I pray harder for rescue with the hope of a new day. 

&nbsp;


The sky is dark and the sun barely seeps through the clouds. It’s raining. The water crashes over me and every wave feels like the end. I hear the helicopter circle above me. I hear it fail to find me and leave. I know the process. I know the odds of being found. They are not in my favour.

&nbsp;


The moon is rising again and I’m so tired. The cold seeps into my bones. My throat is raw. I continue to move, to keep air in my lungs and water out of my mouth. I see my wife in the water with me. A part of me knows I’m delirious, but that rational part of my brain is fading fast. I can’t keep my eyes open. I slip, and I drift off. I wake up and cough out the water that made its way in. I feel things brushing against my legs. I await the bite. It doesn’t come. I see my children too now, dancing in the water with my wife. I don’t know what’s real. I feel something wrap around my ankle. I scream. Nothing is there. 

&nbsp;


My limbs move less and less. I swallow water, once, twice, and again. I know that I will not see the sun rise again. The blackness stretches on endlessly. I cannot tell where the horizon lies, the sky is so dark with a blanket of clouds. I can’t feel anything. I’m losing all strength. I feel myself go under and I can’t reach the surface again. I try, and I try, but my body can’t give anymore. There is nothing left of me. I feel the air build up inside my lungs. I feel my pulse in my ears, in my eyes. I feel the need to breathe so badly that my body betrays me and the ice cold water enters my lungs.";16194609640
This Curse Cast by the Moon;74;6;"In the distance the howls begin and I awake with a start in sheets soaked with sweat. My heart beats frantically against my ribs as I rise from the bed.

&#x200B;

There will be blood. In my dreams the demons whisper their promise. When the clouds part beneath the full moon I can do nothing to stop what occurs.

&#x200B;

I let my senses guide me through the darkness, my bare feet numb with cold. I am aware of every sound around me, of every movement through the branches. Nothing dares cross me, for I walk with Death on this night. I find a clearing in the trees after some time, far enough into the forest that no one will hear me.

&#x200B;

“A sacrifice to you, oh Dark One!” I call, and the shadows around me come alive. The light of the moon is now shining directly on me, the hairs on my neck begin to rise with electricity. My palms are wet with anticipation, goosebumps erupt over my flesh. I close my eyes and breathe deeply, preparing for what is to come.

&#x200B;

When I open them once more I am greeted by the glowing eyes of the Wolf. 

&#x200B;

I try not to move while it inhales my fear. Hot saliva drips from its fangs and I am barely able to hold in the contents of my stomach at the stench of its breath. 

&#x200B;

It stands on its hind legs, towering above my quaking form, and I can only imagine what went through my son’s mind when faced with this Devil. So innocent, so fragile, so helpless. 

&#x200B;

“**Feast!**” demons hiss in my ears.

&#x200B;

Yellowed fangs take hold of my throat, my torso is covered by the warmth of gushing blood and I am pinned to the earth. The Wolf greedily drinks from my wound, pausing to throw back its head and bellow in triumph.

&#x200B;

“**Devour!**” the demons beg. 

&#x200B;

Dagger-like claws slice through my stomach, tearing it open wide. The Wolf’s blood-soaked snout savagely pulls the contents from me.

&#x200B;

*Yes, do it, you fucking fiend*

&#x200B;

The many silver coins I have swallowed clink together between the beast’s jaws as it feeds on my intestines. It gulps them down before it can realize and lets out an anguished howl. 

&#x200B;

“**Treachery!**” the demons shriek.

&#x200B;

I am fading, my vision is blurring, though I can see the Wolf’s body contorting in agony. It throws itself to the ground and writhes as smoke billows from beneath matted fur. Blind with pain, it claws at its body, emitting ear-piercing screams as its flesh melts away.

&#x200B;

My plan has worked, the Wolf is dying. No other man will have to bear the heartache this abomination has caused me. 

&#x200B;

The beast sets aflame, burning a faint greenish hue. I watch its wretched carcass crumble to dust, the last sight my eyes observe before the blackness takes over. I draw my last breath with a smile on my face.

Are you scared of the silence inside of you;

The defending silence?

Wait, are you looking at me right now?

Have you finally seen me? 

You ponder as you notice a strange creature you have never seen looking at you through the window, Burning your corneas with the bright moonlight coming from my eyes.

You're glaring at me with astonishment.

Why is it?

Am I frightening?

Have you finally found something to make you feel fear? 

Have I final-

POP! POP! POP!

1 minute 9 seconds.

Has it really only been 36 seconds?

You continue to glare out the window,

No one is there.

“Was it my imagination?” You wonder.

“Did it run away?”

Will you forever yearn for the feeling you just felt?

The feeling of fear you haven't felt in god knows how long?

Will you forever watch horror movies that only make you feel boredom and crave the real feeling you just felt? 

Perhaps I'll watch too, staring you from the darkness as always, hoping to make eye contact and fulfill that deep void of yours once again.";16194510840
The man on the dock;9;2;"
Kettle Falls was a small fishing town in America. Later it was slowly forgotten. The woods, where it was settled in, grew back and the town grew quiet. The few people there worked hard to keep the town running. One day a young couple and their son moved into the town.

The boy, Tim, was an adventurous, young lad. They lived near the dock where a long time ago the town made most of it’s profit. Tim decided he would go over and try to fish. On his way he met a girl about the same age, Mable. They walked to the dock and big, fat man sat there fishing. His boat tied to the dock. 

“How many have you caught?” Tim asked. “Sixteen million, one-hundred sixty-five thousand, five-hundred and thirty-five,” the man grunted. “How did you manage that, sir?” Mable asked. “Get on the boat,” the man grunted back. They do as they were told and the man took them to an island in the middle of the lake. 

“Here,” the man grunted. “What are we looking at?” They asked. “Oh, its the place you will catch the most fish,” the man grunted. “Thank you, sir! Let’s go to the shack and see what’s in there!” Mable said. The got off and the two ran to a small shack on the island and went in. The man had a big smile on his face— a sinister one. The man took a axe and destroyed the boat. He then walked to the shack.

“Come out, little ones,” the man grunted,”I have a surprise for you two!”";16194455190
Nothing;58;4;"The air is crisp today. A prolonged winter waltzes along my flesh. It calls to me and clamors for my bones to be still, to relinquish all motion and tower among the dead like the numerous tombstones that litter this departing sphere. Yet, I walk. Joints feeble and sickly. Corpse numbed and frail. Soul famished for the liberation that can only be found within warm flesh or cold lead. A crack in the distance prys my orbs from my sweet serendipity to my fiendish present. It sprints, in hopes of penetrating my wit and plucking what little innocence I had left from existence. The end truly is nigh. Do I welcome it? Like an absent lover who has returned for one last screw? Or do I scurry and cower like-

The Scourge Of Gluttony;23;3;"He sat on the numbingly cold kitchen floor, the cold ceramic tiles felt almost painful. The back of his head and the right side of his face were illuminated by the dim slither of moonlight that had crept in through the curtains. 

His jaw had unhinged unnaturally, as he shoved different items of varying levels of edibility into his dark mouth. He did not chew; he didn't need to, it seems, as an apple went into his maw and down to his stomach with little issue. 

The fridge light had stopped working many months before, and he had no money to repair it; any money he made from his underpaying job went straight to food. He did not cook- he did not need to, any kind of food would do. But because of this, the stove, microwave, and almost everything else in his kitchen had been sold. He made a decent amount, an amount that wasn't enough to satisfy his painfully starved body, unfortunately. 

He pushed miscellaneous things into his waiting mouth, almost mechanically, and felt his body plead with him to stop, that it was enough, but he was driven to continue; by an unseen, unrelenting force. 

The unpleasant, uncomfortable taste of bile filled his mouth, with an acidic substance rising from the pit of his tortured stomach. It all came back up, splashing onto his front and soiling the now-empty fridge. Fruits, meat, vegetables, and more had just been squandered on his ungrateful stomach. 

Few seconds passed, and in those seconds, he had decided to reclaim all the wasted food. He used his good hand, the one without the devoured finger, to scoop up some of the vomit off the floor. His snake-like tongue crept out of his mouth and licked the mixture of acid and barely digested food. By no means could he pretend it tasted good, but sometimes you just have to eat what's available. 

After all, how many other people in the world are starving?";16194111660

B: Got fried by the new fencing; we had to take it off. It'll still be able to get around well enough.

A: That's a shame. I hear the shock makes the meat all tough. There's usually a decent amount of it on the legs, though the belly gives the best cuts, for sure.

A: I know. They have everything they need on the farm to be fat and happy: plenty of food, comfortable shelter; not to mention that it's so dangerous outside the fence, with all the predators and such. Really, they’re living better lives than we are. I wish I had that kind of security sometimes…

The Kidnapping;18;2;"I tossed and turned in my bed, hearing the rain pitter-pattering on the window. Insomnia was not uncommon for me. I guess I would have to take some melatonin later. I tossed off the girly flower-and-butterfly sheets, deciding that sleep was overrated and that I should watch the raindrops on the window. I walked across the soft carpeted floor, stretching out my tired muscles. I plopped down on my beanbag in my reading nook near the window. I looked out the window, seeing the streetlights gently illuminating the damp street. Then, In the hallway, I heard footsteps.

At first, I thought I had Imagined them, possibly the sounds of an old apartment building settling. Then I heard it again, louder this time. Definitely footsteps.

""Avery? Is that you? I thought you wouldn't be back until next week.""

""Uh, yeah. I came home early from my trip. The weather was way too shabby for the beach.""

I lived alone in my apartment. I had no roommate.

I pulled a knife out from a shoebox I kept on my bookshelf. Just for self-defense, I told myself. I slowly rose and walked across the room to my door. I saw a shadow underneath the door. I had left my phone on the kitchen counter. The only way to get help was to face the threat. I slowly opened the door and saw a large, bulky man throw a burlap sack over my head.

I jolted awake, relieved that I was still in bed, running my hand over the covers. My hand froze as my blood went cold with fear. I looked around, not recognizing my surroundings. I looked around with realization sinking into me. I was no longer in my room. These were not my sheets. Where was I? Who had done this to me? I looked around the room, trying to make sense of where I was. Then I saw the large glass pane covering the 4th wall of the small room. It contained a bed, a sink, and a toilet. It seemed like I was in a cell. A prison. 

I felt a sharp pain in my head and suddenly felt nauseous. When I came to, I seemed to be on an operation table. A man in a white coat and a surgical mask leaned over me. 

""It's good to see you again. I didn't want my precious experiment to get tainted by the outside world.""";16194134990
In a World Set Ablaze;663;12;" 

Sometimes I feel bad for Tommy. He's too young to remember what life was like before. 

Though every time I awake with lullabies my mother used to sing playing through my head, I envy Tommy. He's too young to remember the radio warnings to evacuate, the planes and the gunshots, the fires and the panic.

&#x200B;

*“We have to get to safety, Marcia, it will be too late tomorrow!”* my father had begged, piling all he could into the station wagon as air raid sirens blared. 

*“People will be injured, they will need a doctor! I promised to help, take the children and go!”* she replied. Tommy reached out for her from his carseat and she leaned in to kiss our foreheads. 

*“You take good care of your brother, you promise?”* she asked, looking at me sternly. I bobbed my head, trying not to cry. She hugged my father and we left, my mother getting smaller and smaller in the rearview.

That was the last time I ever saw her.

&#x200B;

“He isn’t coming back, is he?” 

Tommy’s question took with it any shred of hope I had been harboring. Father had been gone for two days, the trip to town usually took just one. He had kept us alive for six long years, through every bitter winter and scorching summer. Hidden in the forest, in his grandfather’s old hunting cabin, we survived while the rest of the world burned.

“…I don’t think so...” I murmured, keeping my eyes on the floor so Tommy wouldn't see the fear in them.

“Tommy, I’m going first thing tomorrow,” I told him, eyeing our dwindling supply of nonperishables and knowing there was no other choice. His eyes grew wide and teary and I hugged him tightly.

“If I don’t come back… Do everything you have seen us do. Tend the crops. Fetch the water. Gather firewood,” I commanded. He nodded his head under my chin.

&#x200B;

The trip took me from dawn until the afternoon. 

Every store, every home, every memory I had of the past was demolished once I set foot in our old town. Nothing remained besides scorched wreckage and abandoned vehicles. 

I limped through the empty streets on blistered feet, finally arriving at the grocery, or rather what remained. I scaled the rubble at the front of the store, climbing cautiously to avoid shifting the debris, eventually lowering myself down the other side. 

&#x200B;

""This might be the best meal we've ever had,"" Tommy manages to say between mouthfuls of stew, ""I... wish Father was here for it...""

Sometimes I feel bad for Tommy. He'd never eaten fresh meat before.

Though with each bite I see my father trapped between the debris, and I envy Tommy. He'll never know that Father is, in fact, quite present for this meal. 

I look up, silently thanking him for providing one last time. His final message had been written in blood: 

*Take what you need from me*";16193415510
Shadow Puppets;22;8;"For the umpteenth night in a row, Leon found himself wide awake.

Marta gave him some advice when his insomnia first began: “Just close your eyes and relax. Before you know it, you’ll be fast asleep.”

Leon grunted and adjusted his pillow. He glanced over his shoulder and heard her snoring softly.

Marta purchased a humidifier soon after they moved into their new apartment. The baseboard heaters made the air extremely dry which irritated their sinuses and throats. As a bonus, the power button on the device served as a nightlight. When activated, it bathed the dark bedroom in a faint amber glow.

Leon studied the shape of his reclined body cast upon the bedroom wall by the humidifier’s light. It brought back memories. He and his sister used to make shadow puppets when they were children. She could make a bird and a spider and an old man’s face in profile. He could only make a dog. He raised his hand and cast a shadow on the wall. He wiggled his fingers before returning his hand to his side.

An hour later, Leon was still awake and bored beyond belief. He lifted his hand again. This time, its shadow was joined by another. Startled, he lowered his hand and the second followed suit.

Perhaps Marta was playing a joke on him. He turned and saw she was still asleep.

Confused, Leon raised his hand. Its shadow was accompanied once again by the silhouette of a second hand. He quickly drew back and clutched his chest. The unfamiliar silhouette descended slowly. It swayed back and forth like seaweed beneath the waves.

Leon wondered if he was dreaming. He pinched himself. No, he was definitely awake.

He cautiously lifted his hand and breathed a sigh of relief when he saw there was only one shadow cast upon the wall. The feeling was cut short when the silhouettes of two hands rose up and flanked his own.

He withdrew his hand and covered his mouth to prevent himself from crying out.

The silhouettes of the two hands descended from view, wagging their index fingers as if to say, “No, no, no . . .”

Leon took a deep breath and assessed the situation. He was obviously hallucinating. That was the only logical explanation. From what he understood, sleep deprivation could make the mind do strange things.

To test that theory, he thrust his hand upwards defiantly. One hand. One shadow. Success.

He chuckled quietly to himself and imagined what Marta would say when he told her about his experience in the morning.

Suddenly, the bedroom wall was filled with the silhouettes of a dozen hands clawing the air violently. The scene resembled a nest of vipers prepared to pounce upon a rat.

Leon buried his face in his pillow.

Time passed. Nothing happened. He opened his tearful eyes. His breath was labored and his heart pounded in his chest. 

Leon rolled over and discovered Marta was no longer by his side.";16194092310
Marianne's Child;160;10;"Marianne scrambled through the ferine grasslands on the outskirts of Nomansland, the violet heather dense and prevailing. Punishing winds were at her back, weathered saplings dancing to delicate zephyrs. Her wailing infant was strapped inside a ragged sackcloth bag.

""Hush, Joseph. For God's love!"" She begged. ""They will hear ye!""

Glancing upwards to the dire heavens she grew fearful of the dark canvas of clouds waltzing in elemental patterns. She hurried on, past the decimated carcasses of wild Hampshire horses, towards the solemn church bells.

Her newborn son cried out. Joseph was hungry but Marianne was spent. She needed to rest. Amidst the rolling haze she could see the church spire. Marianne ran, admonishing her boy to keep quiet.

The cool hiss of the mist caressed her as it grew thicker. Hidden within, she slowed down to catch her breath.

Someone violently pulled her backwards.

She landed awkwardly on her back and on top of Joseph. Painfully she turned around and stood up.

She knew immediately that Joseph had been taken. Shaking, she concentrated and heard him crying. Marianne set off calling his name.

Stumbling through the damp, coarse grass she could see the blurred shadow of the kidnapper moving in the mist.

""Mummy's coming, Joseph! I'm coming!""

As she got closer, the ground under her feet changed. Soft heathland gave way to hard, unstable aggregate. She peered down. Bones. An ossuary of tender, flesh-clean bones visible far beyond what the mist allowed.

Marianne was catching up. Extolling herself with a final release of her will, she grabbed the abductor. The reaction was immediate. He spun around, headbutting her with considerable force.

Dizzy, Marianne tumbled to the ground. The kidnapper stood over her.  Joseph, limp, was held in his arms.

""Give me ma… boy…. back."" She slurred.

The thin, dirty man gave the dead child to her. Marianne cradled poor Joseph and screamed.

""It's done, Marianne."" The abductor said. ""Look. He was already changed and would have killed us all. Those fools in the church would have died harbouring ye!""

Marianne held her son up. Six nodules were protruding from his sides. These would have transformed into additional legs, allowing Joseph to move with considerable pace as he hunted.

Above, she heard the voice of the clouds, a melody of thunder and rain approaching. The man helped Marianne to her feet.

""Leave that thing,"" The man ordered. ""With the others.""

Marianne placed her son's body on the carpet of bones. Crows were hopping around nearby, patiently waiting for them to leave so they could feed.

Joseph had been the first child born for over ten years. Her husband, William, had no doubt been hung already for the crime of procreation. Marianne had given birth only two days after he had forced himself on her. She had fled in panic.

The man held Marianne's hand as they returned to Nomansland. He began to weep.

""I'm frightened, Pa."" Marianne bawled as she saw the crowd gathering excitedly around the gallows.";16193642700
Contract;22;2;"When I was little, my parents always told me never to sign a contract or anything like that. I remember very well when they, incredibly frightened, told me that if I did it there would be terrible consequences. I didn't quite understand why, but their face, their voice was enough for me to understand that they were telling the truth. 

I believed it at the time, but when I became a teenager, my first doubts began to arise. 

Today, my grandfather came to me with a paper in his hand. His face was terrified, almost as if he was going to die. He told me to sign it. I did, not knowing exactly what was going on. 

Only now do I discover that my grandfather died an hour before I signed.";16194022120
Night Terrors;257;10;"I was in my late twenties when I experienced my first night terror. 

My imagination turned a hanging shirt and a box on a shelf into an warped inky creature hunched in my closet.

My body was frozen and all I could do was stare until I fell back into a fitful sleep.

The feeling haunted me and I tried to remember to always close the closet door before bed but it didn’t help. My imagination began to change other things as the night terrors came more often. Jeans on my chair became slouched sitting demons and even the corner of my doorframe became a head peaking down from the ceiling.

I dreaded going to sleep because I just couldn’t stop my brain. I started to sleep less and less and I lost my job. The said it was due to lack of drive.

Stress and malnourishment pushed me to a tipping point and I fell.

I think that I died. 

I can’t be sure though because I don’t remember my death.

Everything is strange now.

Time passes different and I go unnoticed except it seems at night.

I find myself in a woman’s closet.

I don’t know how I got here. She didn’t say anything when I walked in and hasn’t said anything all day after I moved to her closet and she didn’t remember to close the door.

I am watching her sleep.

I miss sleep. I thought the dead would get to rest.

But I can see her eyes are open now and fixed on me.

She doesn’t make a noise.

I wonder what she sees.

I wonder what she will tell herself in the morning.";16193460110
Hide and seek.;23;5;"I was playing hide and seek with my friends and I found the perfect spot in a pitch black closet. 
The silence in the closet was deafening so it was startling when I heard a slight rustle coming from behind me. Before I could react two hands reached around me covering my mouth and securing my hands.

*""Don't make a sound""*, a voice hissed from the darkness.

I whimpered in response. Tendrils of terror spreading through my body rendering me frozen and trembling. He was pulling me further into the darkness but that didn't make any logical sense. I had been hiding in a broom closet. 

*Where is he taking me?*

*What is this place?*";16193933410
My ventriloquist dummy is trying to kill my wife;116;10;"I found Chuckles in a dumpster behind the magic shop where I spent most of my childhood. Younger me thought he was the neatest thing ever, so I took him home, cleaned him up, and even bought a book on ventriloquism.

It wasn’t long before I discovered Chuckles was cursed. Whenever I wore him, it felt as though I was the puppet. I heard his voice inside my head ordering me to do things. He got us into all kinds of trouble—trouble which people blamed *me* for.

It started off small. Like sticking gum in a girl’s hair or stealing candy from the store. But when Chuckles spray-painted ‘Ms. Wendell has a stinky coochie’ on the side of Mr. Wendell’s barn, that was the final straw.

I got sent to a psychologist who insisted Chuckles was my ‘coping mechanism’, and the actions were really just me lashing out. As if. I kept explaining he was magical, but she wouldn’t listen. Nevertheless, I agreed to put him away before things got out of hand. I locked him inside an old hamper which I put in the attic.

Decades passed. I grew up, got married, and forgot about the whole ordeal.

But then one night my wife and I were arguing in the kitchen.

“How could you play XBOX for five days straight when my mothers in the hospital?” my wife shouted. “Don’t you ever think about anyone but yourself?”

As I stormed into the hall, I felt a peculiar pinch at the back of my skull.

*You didn’t forget about your ol’ pal chuckles did ya?*

In an almost trance-like state, I climbed into the attic, pushed aside a box of old magazines, and found the familiar hamper.

Chuckles was wearing his trademark pinstripe suit and red bowtie. As I slipped my hand into his back, a tingling sensation ran along my fingertips. Waves of excitement cascaded through my entire body.

The moment Chuckles was on my arm, his mouth flapped open.

*Kill her.*

Without thinking, I ripped him off. I couldn’t keep him around—it was too dangerous. I loved my wife. Oh sure, we'd been having some problems lately, but so did every couple. I carried Chuckles downstairs, meaning to rush straight to the dump.

But then my wife screamed my name. Slowly, I crept into the kitchen, where she was grinding her teeth.

She held up my credit card statement. “What the FUCK do you think you’re doing spending $5,000 dollars on a website called OnlyFans?”

My hand trembled.

*Kill her. She’ll never understand you like I do. Kill her, then it’ll be just like old times.*

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and pulled Chuckles onto my arm.

“Answer me you sleazy piece of shit,” my wife shouted.

Once Chuckles was in position, his head completed a full rotation. He took control, guiding us towards the kitchen counter.

And there, he picked up a knife, then turned towards my wife…";16193602810
Rivalry;73;4;"I have always hated my sister for as long as I can remember. She is always in my face and never gives me a moment of peace.

It is obvious that my parents favour her as I have heard my mother's muffled voice saying that my sister will be a carbon copy of her.

I decided to kill her and try it make it look like an accident. I finally spotted the perfect opportunity and strangled her until she finally stopped moving.

It was satisfying watching my mother weep as the doctor explained that the umbilical cord must have gotten wrapped around her throat.";16193689280
The Nice Monster Under My Bed;11;4;" There are no monsters under my bed. I am safe here.

I don’t know why I must repeat that, doc. The monster under my bed is *nice.* His name is Claydon. He is good fun, I promise you. He reads to me, nice funny stories that make me laugh out loud. He brings me candy and chocolate every day. And we can talk for hours and hours about anything.

The best part is the dares. He’ll dare me to do all kinds of cool things. Like plucking out my eyeballs and eating it. I did it, with scissors, cut around the optic nerve and popped it in my mouth like fish balls. They tasted all squishy in my mouth. Then there is the other time I ate my arm. Just bit the flesh clean off, chewed it for a bit. The vessels were all showing, and blood was seeping out onto the floor, but it tasted nice. Like eating chicken-flavoured rubber. That’s just one of the cool things we did together. Life is never boring when Claydon is around.

Claydon is not like the others. He is a nice monster. I promise you that!

But you know what, doc? Claydon has been telling me things about you. That you want to take us apart, take us far away from each other. That’s terrible, doc. How can you do that to us? I don’t have any other friends. You are threatening to take away my only friend.

I will not let you take away my only friend in the world.

Are you feeling sleepy, doc? That’s my meds working. I crushed them and put it in your water when you were not looking. Claydon told me that is how I should get rid of you. He has the best plans, you know. I hope you fall asleep and die on the spot. Then I do not have to see you again, ever.

…

Wait, what are you doing? I DON’T WANT TO TAKE MY MEDS. I WANT TO SEE CLAYDON! STOP FORCING THE PILLS DOWN MY THROAT. GAAAAAAAAAAAAARGLE…

CLAYDON! DON’T DISAPPEAR! COME BACK! YOU’RE MY BEST FRIEND!

I am okay now. Claydon is not real.

Things You Must Check Tonight;24;2;"**Disclosure: If you read this, you will become aware of *her* and be made completely vulnerable. If you wish to sleep soundly tonight, and for the rest of nights to come, I recommend that you do not continue. If you do, make sure you do the checklist.**


*She* is not a woman. Honestly, I don't know what she is, but describing her as female is the best that I can do.


She is the rising fear that lingers in the dark. She is the whisper that shivers through the wind. She is that ghostly feeling that's always behind you...


She is the scream in your nightmares and the creature in your cupboard...and she is the terrifying and crushing weight of silence when you're terrified and alone...


...And *She* is getting stronger.


Now that you're aware of her, she will try and manifest into something that I still can't comprehend myself, or even put into words...but I can, however, tell you how to keep her out...or, at least try...


Please remember the disclosure, there's no turning back now...she knows that you know about her, you must continue, and if you don't, well, I just have one final thing to say...May God be with you tonight.


Okay, first of all, as much of a cliche as it is, check under the bed. If you find black hairs or black fibres, remove them immediately and burn them. No other method will work.


Secondly, check the back of your bedroom door for black smudges, or what *may* look like fingerprints. If you find *anything*, wipe clean using hot water and a white cotton cloth.


And finally, if there is a mirror in your room, be sure to take it down and sleep with the door closed...trust me...


(Side note: if you have findings from both under the bed *and* on the door, **do not** sleep in that room tonight, even after removal.)


Oh, and if at any point you hear scratching, then I'm really sorry...and it'll be best to just close your eyes...";16193808980
My Ballerina is Changing;22;5;"The song in my music box changed last night, and now the little ballerina on the top spins the wrong way. She should be like all the others, a lissome girl with blue eyes and porcelain skin, but her skin has darkened, her thighs thickened, and I realize with shock that she looks just like me.

I've been staring at her ever since I woke up and I can't remember the moment she changed.

She picks up speed with every rotation, no longer that calm, graceful pirouette my music box had once known. Her dance matches the frenzied, discordant hum of the music, it’s angles all the way down, ballet with the curves filed into points.

I’ve had this box for years, and who knows how long it lived on the dusty shelves of the foreclosed estate I’d bought it from. It never did anything like this. The music was always so sweet, Swan Lake, every time. There wouldn’t be any swans in the lakes this song played over, all the life would lurk below the surface, where the light died and the water turned to murk.

The ballerina picks up speed and a part of me wants to follow her on her wrong-way-around dance, but I haven’t danced in years and wouldn’t be able to force my body into the positions now, if any positions exist for the dance she does.

The song reaches a feverish climax and the ballerina bends forward, her sharp motions cutting through the air like a knife, independent of any mechanism I can imagine. She poses on the pointed toes of one foot, a hand stretched upward, a leg raised impossibly high. It’s my face etched onto hers, carved as if by the hand of some long forgotten master. The song beats once more and she turns in a blur with it. There’s a snapping noise and for a moment I think it’s her ankle until she steps forward off her little wooden perch. She approaches like she’s walking a runway or stalking prey, the motions all look same fitted onto her body which is just mine in miniature.

“Baby, you OK in there?” my husband’s voice calls through the bedroom door. “Something sounds weird.”

He heard something, but could he really be hearing what I hear? If he could hear this music, even dying as it was now, he’d know there was something really wrong. But I can’t speak, I open my mouth and no words come out.

The ballerina reaches the end of the music box and beckons me forward with a crooked finger. I go to her, I don’t know why.

I’m so close now, and at this distance she’s even more like me.

She reaches out and lays a single finger on my stomach.

*She knows.*

Her belly grows and I look down at mine in horror. I’ve never wished so badly that it wasn’t flat. I try to scream, but that doesn’t come out either.";16193834010
Human Caterpillar;1355;80;"I was a young’un, maybe six or seven, and my daddy was taking me out for my very first hunt. I remember sitting in the backseat, watching the raindrops travel down the window - colliding with other raindrops - forming mesmerizing patterns. I’d imagine the raindrops as tiny people consuming other tiny people, the amassing volume of which would morph into a blob-like monstrosity.

“Fuck me,” my daddy exclaimed, slidding to a sudden stop. “Would you look at that?”

It was a hot day in a hot week in an even hotter month, and as such the rain had felt like a blessing. The scarce drops would vaporize the moment they hit the searing tarmac though, and as I climbed out of the car, the first thing I noticed were clouds of rising vapor. *Like a volcano eruption*, I thought.

The second thing I noticed was a thick trail of crimson goo running from where we’d come from, and all the way to the strange creature a little ways up the road.

“Stay back boy,” my father whispered in a hushed tone, silently sauntering toward the thing.

It moved like a caterpillar, you know. Back arching upwards, backside pushing the front forward, rinse and repeat. *That’s a Human Caterpillar*, I thought, sneaking up behind my daddy to get a better look.

Its face was a mangled mess, having scraped against the tarmac for miles and miles. Loose skin flapped around the boiling flesh, the blazing heat having turned the road into a frying pan. *Why did it crawl there?* I wondered. There had to be better places.

“Well, I’ll be damned,” my daddy murmured, scratching his head. “Never seen anything quite like it.”

There were blisters and wounds all over the creatures’ naked body. Deep lacerations, cuts, gashes, on crispy, sunburnt skin. When it spotted us, it sped up, a tormented gurgling sound following it’s incredibly slow escape.

“Why does it do that, daddy?” I asked, wincing at the pungent smell of it.

He shrugged, “Not thinking straight in the heat I reckon.”

We watched it move and convulse painfully for a minute or two, before dad walked up to it, grabbed it by the neck, and flung it over his shoulder.

“You gonna kill it, daddy?” I asked.

“Nah,” he shook his head. “Can still use it.”

We returned to the car, and daddy secured it in the trunk. They’d escape sometimes, you know. This one was pretty stupid though. Couldn’t get out of the restraints, so it just crawled away like a caterpillar.

“You did good, boy,” my dad said, ruffling my hair playfully. “Your very first hunt.”

On the way back I noticed a little smudge on the window. A tiny drop of blood. I imagined it was a special little guy, and marvelled at his wonderful parkour skills as he traversed and dodged all the obstacles passing us by.

And when we got home, daddy let me feed the herd.

It was a good day.";16192973680
Stomping Grounds;8;1;"Mr. Bamford watched the protest through his binoculars. They had massed outside of the fence surrounding the storage yard, waving signs and chanting slogans. Their objections to his project were nothing he hadn't heard several times before -- housing density, congested street access, lowered property values. But this storage yard was a low-profit operation; several dozen gleaming new condominiums were a much better use for the space. So what if the only access to it was through quiet residential streets, not built for the increased volume? He didn't care. The town council was happy for the extra income, he'd make a bundle, and when it was over, he'd go back to where he lived in the big city, far away from any problems he'd caused. Meanwhile, he just had to deal with some insolent locals.

Just past the protesters, he could see the house of the crazy old lady with the big metal dinosaur in her yard. She had hung a sign in his arms: ""Stop the condos! Preserve my habitat!"" He snorted derisively; this just confirmed she was loony. Small towns really seemed to collect the weirdos. Still, he felt unsettled. He had expected this sleepy beach community to be a pushover; instead, he found it choked with eccentric troublemakers, more like a small desert town from a bad grindhouse movie. He'd be glad when this was over.

Later that night, after finishing a bunch of phone calls with reporters, he left his office to walk to his car. He smirked as he saw some storage-yard tenants try to sort through their stuff using flashlights. He had turned off all of the yard lights, to save money. If they didn't like it, they could move; he was having the place torn down anyway.

It was a simple jaunt to his car, through the empty parking lot. He heard a loud metal crash; he looked around to see what it was, but didn't find anything in the dark. He heard a series of smaller metal crashes; blaming the tenants, he vowed to eliminate nighttime access to the storage yard the very next day. He realized the metal crashes were getting closer to him. As he hurried his pace, so did the pace of the metal stomping sounds. They sounded like they were on top of him! He turned to look, and in the dim light of the waning moon, he saw the gaping maw of a Tyrannosaurus descend quickly upon him.

The next morning, the nice old lady watered her plants. She looked up at her big, rusty metal dinosaur, and beamed. She peered closer; the reddish-brown around his mouth was a different shade. She clucked her tongue as she adjusted the hose nozzle from ""spray"" to ""jet"". ""Oh, you've made a mess of yourself,"" she cooed. ""Let me get that for you."" As she washed out his mouth, a few chunks of shredded meat fell out and splattered on the ground. She grinned. ""Oh, good. My plants needed some fertilizer.""";16193956510

Host:  “Oh no, Michael.  What have you done?  You forgot to say…..”

Crowd:  *IN THAT CASE!!!*

Host hands Jamal a bottle of acid while brutes secure Michael and hold his mouth open.  The crowd chants POUR! POUR! POUR! Jamal pours the acid into his mouth and his screams become a gurgling, bloody froth.  The brutes drag Michael from the set.

Host:  “And then there were two!  Jamal, you won the last round, so you begin!”

Jamal:  “In that case, I will press Europe’s face against an industrial belt sander.”

*Audience claps semi-enthusiastically.*

Europe:  “In that case, I will drill through Jamal’s head, starting from his rectum!”

*Crowd begins crowing with delight.*

Jamal:  “In that case, I will intubate Europe’s lungs and pump her full of helium until her lungs explode!”

*Audience clamors emphatically.*

Europe:  “In that case, I will bite chunks out of Jamal, chew them up and then regurgitate them into Jamal’s mouth.”

*A slight murmur ripples through the studio until one person screams, “No! Booo!”, then another and the crowds begins to jeer.*

The brutes come and grab Europe while Jamal takes the tank of helium.  He shoves a tube down her lungs and turns the pressure on.  Her chest expands until a jet of gas shoots through.  The crowd goes wild while she’s taken away.

Brutes bring out three attachés.

Host:  “Well Jamal, you’re the final contestant.  And now you have a choice.  In two of these, you’ll find a horrible death, but in one you’ll find salvation.  All you have to do is choose.”

Jamal (nervously):  “What’s... in that case?”";16193242430
How are you off the wall;9;0;"Whenever my son sees this woman around my area he always asks her ""how are you off the wall?"" And I embarrassingly apologise to her about my son. She seems to always laugh about it though and we always seem to have funny small chit chats every time my son sees her, where once again he would always ask her the same question which is ""how are you off the wall?"" And I then have another small chit chat with her. I told my son many times to stop asking this woman the same question over and over again. 

The way my son asks this woman the same question ""how are you off the wall?"" Over and over again with the same surprised look and body language, I'm starting to think that my son must have some kind of mental condition and to be honest I think I know what the answer to that actually is but I keep on pushing it away at the back of my mind. I always force myself to see my son as normal but I know that he is not. Everyone finds him weird and no body smiles at him apart from that one woman which he always has to ask her ""how are you off the wall?"" 

She has the patience of an angel and the small chit chat I have with her are really good. There are times I get angry with my son for doing this to the woman, and I then drag him home and get him up to the attic where the thousands of secret photos I have taken of this woman are stuck up all over the attic walls and ceiling. I shout at him ""these are photos ok Daniel! They are photos! which I have secretly obsessively taken of this woman and stuck them all over the attic where I worship this woman. Photos are meant to be stuck on walls and the people you take photos of are not meant to be stuck on walls do you get it!"" I shout at him 

Daniel nods his head but I know that he is going to ask the same question to this woman when we see her around again.";16193861890
Hell of a Good Joke;19;4;"We were flying high on a speedball concoction of my own devising, feeling that Utah wind rush through our hair as we sped down the highway. We were low on fuel and high on life and decided that that gas station up ahead would make for a great hit. A glorious, violent, high speed, murderously wonderful hit.

Mick and me were tight, tighter than brothers. We met in San Quentin and kept the faith through long years in the cage. We were shocked and delighted to find somebody who understood- bullshit job, obey the speed limit, tea and fucking crumpets with a nice girl while you pick out curtains and pay down your Toyota, save for retirement. *Fuck* all that. Live hard and be a warrior instead. You'll die young but who gives a fuck, we were born dead and minimum wage jobs were worse than any prison or morgue.

Mick and me been dropping bodies from here to fucking Buffalo, and we moved too fast for the cops to even tag the toes before we were on to our next hit. I figured we'd get nailed sooner or later, but until then we were modern day Comanches and it was raiding season.

Mick kicked the swinging glass doors open and nailed a little old lady near the slushy machine with his beloved twelve gauge. Mick never cared much for civilians getting in the way our our little business transaction with the cashiers. I made a beeline for the cash. I stopped and stared. Lo and fucking behold.

The cashier was a skeleton with thin, grey, rotting skin beneath his cheery blue gas station uniform. Dude had been dead for weeks, looked like.

""Mick.""

""What?""

""Mick.""

""*What?* Oh, fuck."" So he saw the corpse too.

I hefted my Glock. Whatever. The coke and junk in my system let me keep my cool, threatening a dead man. Roll with it, you know? He opened the till and handed me the money. Skin. Desiccated, stretched out human skin, tattooed to match all the pics and numbers on real money.

I fingered the bills. Giggled. Hell of a good joke.

The corpse said, ""Want the coinage? I have a lot. Most people pay in change round here."" He ripped open the paper cylinders and human teeth fell out onto the counter, chunks of flesh still hanging off the exposed roots.

I mimed tipping my hat. ""Much obliged to you, young man. Gentleman and a scholar."" I shot him, mostly out of curiosity. Nothing much happened. Didn't even bleed. He waved bye-bye as Mick and me left. But in the lot our engine wouldn't start. Battery died.

Hard fix, that. Hot Utah sun dehydrating us, hard to think through the sweat and bright light. Mick's nodding off in his seat, puking down his shirt. My heart pounding like fuck and exploding in my chest like a little hand grenade.

I kept trying the ignition and nada. Giggled. Hell of a good joke.";16193617430

Latermin Mall;51;2;"I walked into the walls of the new mall that had opened near the street corner. It was weird because I couldn't remember the mall being there the week before but apparently, the owners John Kubler and Adam Hel, surprised us all with the new shopping centre.

I walked past a shop in the mall where someone was holding a shopping bag with the shoplifting detectors going off. The innocent woman denied the idea of her shoplifting and stuck to her story about her paying for absolutely everything that was in the bag.

I glanced at my right arm at the scar that happened due to the train incident, very recently a train derailed and I was one of the lucky passengers who lived through the experience but I remember the rubble and the people left in it. I couldn't remember anything after that up until I woke up in bed to my husband next to me. I decided to come here because seeing a new place open out of nowhere, I felt obliged to go.

I peered behind the woman denying the shoplifting and saw a mum getting angry and yelling at the cashier trying to get a refund for something that, from what I can see, didn't even exist. Rolling my eyes, I looked to the other shops in the mall to entertain me.

As I approached the new Rosi Rise Clothes Shop, I remember bumping into someone that seemed familiar to me. She introduced herself to me as Sharon (I remember mishearing her first time thinking she was Charon) and we started talking about how she also found it weird that the mall opened out of nowhere and talked about the newest bargains at the clothes shop was dragging in more customers than it had ever done before.

The problem was that all the customers, and everyone in the mall, looked familiar.

Then it hit me like a shockwave, I depressingly remembered back to the train situation, and everyone in the mall looked so much like the people on the train that day, almost like they were the same.

No, no it can't be, all of them died.

I remember being at the end of the mall, and I felt calm for the first time in the mall. I close my eyes...

And accept my death.";16193390340
purgatory.;18;1;"and I Wake.

It is sunrise. My heart is pounding stronger than ever. The nightmare is back.

My feet have carried me downstairs faster than my brain can even acknowledge it.

I stand there in the foyer at the bottom of the stairs, my body bare, my feet in agony as they touch the cold, wood floor. Except it isn't cold, it's warm, it's melting, it's gone.

It's gone into an all-consuming, all-encompassing, all-correcting hole of hell, of horror, and I am falling before I can even feel the change.

Their arms reach for me, beg for me to help them, caress me with their nails and their fingertips, their eyes desperate. They long for survival, they long to be heard. They need what I need, they are starved of the light and the hope that that light brings. I fall past them and they scream at me, the words aren't coherent, they are gibberish, they are nothing, they are prayers. They are prayers of helpless believers who will never understand. I reach out to them. I always reach out to them.

I fall into the darkness, their prayers fading with the last of their light. It is a long journey to the bottom, I think of Mother, I think of her whip, I think of Liliana. My tongue caresses her name inside of my mouth, but my lips are pressed together in the silence of my soul as I know that to feel is to fall further down, down, down, down. I hit the ground.

The ground is a lie, we know the truth of the hell promised to us through the scriptures that they preached into our ears until they bled, that they shoved down our throats until we vomited it back up to them. I walk forward through the darkness, shivering and sweating in simultaneous succession, surprised that my soul is still surviving, as this new world around me contradicts so much that we are stuck, we are stranded.

I am blinded, I am washed from head to toe in the white darkness of light, the hell that is not hell. I see her, I see what I have done. I sit next to the body, what is left of it.

They put me here for a reason. It was self-defense, I repeat in my head, over, over, and over, I did not mean to hurt her. I am not a sinner. I am not a sinner. I am not a sinner.

Never Cheat Death, Especially Twice;8;3;"A heart attack, they'd said. A bad one. I'd legally died for 3 minutes and 44 seconds. I was 42 years old.


I didn't even realise what was happening. I just thought I was dreaming.


I was in a bookstore. It was an old bookstore, but, it was surprisingly bright.


I wandered around in a lonely, timeless daze for a while. Time could not be counted, seen or felt.


It was only when I picked up a book that I realised I wasn't dreaming.


**First word.** Was the title, and a picture of myself as a baby. I slowly opened the book with intrigue and slight confusion...


Suddenly, I was sucked into the book, and ultimately, I was reliving the moments just before, during, and just after my first word...which was, ""No,"" by the way.


The book then sucked and spun me back out into the bookstore. I replaced the book with a wholesome feeling and continued to walk through the store. I lazily strolled up and down every aisle, scanning the spines of the books, running my finger tips across them and quickly absorbing their titles; 


**First Steps**


**First Kiss**


**Losing My Virginity**


**First Driving Lesson**


The books continued in no particular order, my only guess would be because time is nonexistant here and it wouldn't really matter what part of my life-line went where.


I jumped in and out of my memories. One after the other. It was incredible. I could relive any part of my life. I was free to enjoy any part of the bookstore. I could go back and see old family members again and bask in their loving presence. I could do this forever!


THUMP!...I go flying across the room. Something just punched me directly in my chest. I felt no pain though, and I get back up...


THUMP!!...I'm knocked backwards once more. This time, my entire body penetrates through the walls and I'm propelled back into my now worthless and half dead body.


The next few days were apparently touch and go, and the doctors warned me that if I didn't take it easy and eat healthier, another heart attack would be following very soon. But, I didn't care. I was barely listening. All I could think about now, was that bookstore. 


I was discharged a week later and I returned home. *Home.* A sad empty apartment, and sad little life. 


 *Pfft!* Nothing in this world would compare to what I had experienced.


I...I just had to go back. I thought back to what to the doctors had warned...


...Next thing I knew, it was dark. Utterly and completely, dark. 


I felt around...nothing.


No sounds.


No light.


No books.


Nothing.


There was nothing...


Forever.";16193709030
Do you hear the horns?;14;2;"I live in are very rural area, where’s it more of a small town friendly feel. The little town I live in use to be a very big textile community until the early 90s. Then things started to change, most of the shops and restaurants closed up and the railroad tracks turned into walking trails or just taken out of the ground. So there’s no other explanation for the things I have experienced. Tho It’s more common then you would think, many of you may even experience it as well. You’re just unaware of the cold truth that lies behind that noise that you hear...way off in the distance through out the night. 

   If you’ve ever laid awake at night you would have noticed, every so often you’ll hear the faintest sound of a train horn. You may not think much of it at first but then you hear it for a second time, now fresh on your mind again you start to think...I don’t live very close to any train tracks it must be my ears playing tricks on me. So you continue on with what you were doing. There it was again it sounds as if it’s almost louder this time. You decided to just ignore it. this is just a figment of my imagination you mumble to yourself just to put your mind at ease. 


   What you don’t know is that some times our curiosity can get the better of us. I really must warn you; if you ever hear the faint cry of a train horn try your hardest to ignore it at any cost. Turn the music up, blast the tv, close your eyes and count the sheep. Anything but fall victim to the siren like song of that horn. If you finally do at last venture out into the night entranced by the unknowing of the sound you hear calling you ahead. Then you just might find what you are looking for...


  Now miles alway from home still walking steadily toward your undesirable fate, you smirk slightly has you hear that horn grow closer and closer as you walk ahead. No flash light for all you need is the horn to guide you, no shoes because you had no time to think about grabbing them before you went out into the forest. But it does not faze you has you step on every thorn and rock, because you feel no pain until you find your peace among the sound. 

  Some say the sound takes you to your happiest moment,giving you anything you’ve ever desired; but others say it takes you away to a dark place in-between Our reality and the beyond. Stuck, suffering and begging for it all the end. So what will you do next time you hear the horn call through the night? Will you follow? Or choose to stay safe?";16193582440
Pinch me;30;3;"“Fatty Fynlee, fatty Fynlee!” the bullies chanted. “Can we pinch you? You have so much blubber!”

“You are welcome to pinch me. I don’t mind.”

I watched from a distance in the high school hallway as our newest transfer, Fynlee, welcomed the abuse without any signs of sadness or embarrassment. Her body was certainly unique. Only the area near her stomach appeared abnormal, as if she were wearing a hula hoop around her skin. Her skin-tight clothing stood out though amongst her peers. She was an easy target.

As some of our high school’s worst pinched away, I ran up to them and broke it up. Within a week of Fynlee’s arrival, the gruesome, mangled corpses emerged.

First, they found Seth, the leader of the bullies. Blood and skin chunks lined the walls of his bedroom. The cops said it was like walking into a room-sized microwave, where the human soup had been heated too long and had exploded against the walls. Seth’s eyes had also been plucked from his skull.

Our town was in a frenzy when three more bodies surfaced days later. The other bullies in the group suffered a similar fate, skin fragments splattered all over, eyes gouged out. The cops had no leads, but as these events were unfolding, Fynlee disappeared. Suspicions grew. Was Fynlee to blame for the deaths of those who tormented her?

A month passes and out of nowhere, a circus appears. These kinds of events never happen where I live, so of course the entire town heads over in droves. The big exhibit, the moment the crowd has been waiting for arrives. A cloth-covered cage is wheeled out on stage. 

“And now it’s time for you to meet the all-seeing Fynlee the Frightful!” The man removes the cloth.

The crowd gasps when it sees Fynlee sitting in the cage, stomach exposed. 

“Now, don’t be shy. Step up and give her a pinch!” the man says.

A small line forms. A woman reaches in between the bars of the cage and pinches Fynlee. The spectator faints mid-scream. I rush the stage to get a glimpse of what is transpiring. And then I see it. A lazy river of eyeballs flow beneath Fynlee’s transparent stomach skin.  

Other onlookers rip open the door to the cage and surround Fynlee.

“You killed my son!” a man shouts, as he pulls out a gun and shoots Fynlee in the face. 

Fynlee collapses, as we watch her life fade away. The woman who passed out is loaded onto a stretcher by the handful of circus employees. They drive off before the cops arrive.

A year passes and I get a call from a friend across the country. She tells me about a mysterious circus that arrived with an exhibit called Scary Sherri. Turns out that Sherri is the woman who passed out at the circus I attended. And this Sherri has a ring around her stomach. I just hope nobody pinched her.";16193333200
I Know A Trick;7;3;"The buzzing goes away and Trick wears off. Disgusted, they stand up. She's staring, I feel everything she's been thinking jabbering at me like gangrene, I scratch, doesn't stop.

Voices by the glass, German or Italian (she told me they weren't but I know she’s lying).  They want me to Trick again. Harry's pit stains look gross; dresses in cheap shirts, resents his tie. Told me that once. Told me I’m lucky to have her but she strokes my leg I twitch and she jerks away.

Guns big on hips, Glocks so they won’t run out, ha ha, George never shot his, lucky because it ain’t anything to be proud of or remember like that kid. The kid and my body rocks again I can't even stop it anymore. Seen him a few times pegged for a mule he ran and shot, dropped him didn't think gun in hand no mule anymore, just a corpse and a stain. Suspension, cleared but his family, screaming about their baby –

""Who's yelling, sweetheart?"" Talking again, my mouth goes on with no fucking regard to anything; shut it, nothing, sorry, quiet now. She squeezes my hand. Squeeze back but too hard she looks pained.

They're kneeling and it’s the same just one more, I know it sucks but you’re helping, good cop should do the right thing, nail those motherfuckers, not saying dummy can't keep details straight between Tricks. Let him alone, she begs, but they won't, can't get rid of her because I'll be screeching and hitting. Hurts having her here, hurts worse not, she's going away with the kids leave me locked up in that place, potatoes for lunch shots make me dumb, she swears no even when I beg, can't order anything but potatoes.

Won’t let me go, if I Trick they may let me leave. Don't remember how I learned The Trick but after I answer questions I couldn't before. It’s like: stand and bend, paper bag to mouth and buzzing, bees in my ears and remember, don't know whether I'm puking word vomit because sometimes remember stuff wrong but I tell them what I see. Still not enough.

Into the bag, buzzing louder, her hand on my butt, don't fall and break my head (break it worse you mean) and… ready. Fall back sit up close eyes and the assholes, yelling five-oh and hitting and world fuzzy and the bat and my mouth again, the clear firm voice I remember, but my brain floats, dimly aware of their questions about the Incident, the bat again and again...

While my mouth runs my brain is free, remember the pills she thinks I forgot, free me from what I can't stand, blathering moron can't tie shoelaces, goddamn it I'm here but can’t say that I still know what's happening even if Harry's tie is ugly and striped.

Buzzing dies and mouth moving again but nothing's coming, just jaw twitching like a fish.  They're staring until they look away.";16193618080
Home;46;3;"I gaze out at the ocean, moonlight reflecting bewitchingly off the water's surface. Sand feels pleasant on my bare feet, but will never be right for me. Seeing the beach is empty, I smile.

No one knows where I am. No one ever will. I will simply vanish, never to be found. And then I will cause others to vanish.

The drive took hours, but was worth every second. It was better than that sterile cubicle, the perpetual boredom of the way I've been living. So bored, so stressed.  
I've spent years in denial, but like the beautiful ocean, I was born to live unrestrained.

I walk slowly toward the water, disrobing as I go. Clothing will never be right for me. No matter, I don't need them anymore.  
I stop once the water is up to my waist. I focus and bring power to my voice. I speak the incantation carefully, wanting everything perfect. My legs alter, my skin becoming scales and feet becoming fins. My teeth sharpen, ready to tear flesh. When the spell is complete, my silver tail is shining in the moonlight for the first time in years. It's such a relief to breathe with my gills again. I am home, I am free.

 I swim away, thinking about my first meal back home. Likely they'll be coming to collect all the pretty shells so tourists will buy from them. They'll forget what they're doing at the sound of beautiful, hypnotizing singing. By the time water fills their lungs and my teeth rip their throat, it's too late. Their terror and struggling will only add flavor.

I couldn't lure anyone away for years. I thought I could live without it, becoming a perfect human. But siren blood and the accompanying bloodlust make me who I am. I'm back where I belong, and soon I will feast.";16193234010

My body is beautiful. 

I poke and I prod and I pull and I push and I grab and I rip and I squish and I snap. 

My body is beautiful. 

Or maybe I'm trying to convince myself that it is.

Diary entry #14;6;0;Yeah, I might be crazy. All these voices in my head swirling around like some fucking demonic vortex from hell. Sometimes, and let me be clear to you ONLY sometimes. I just wanna give in to the voices and go crazy you know? But I guess that is what makes me different from the others. I never give in because these voices are what keep me sane. Keeping on top of them at least. Its like a sense of control that feels like as long I keep the voices at bay, I will always be in power of myself and more importantly the others.;16193518230
Piggy Bank;886;25;"Oh, hey, hello. You must be Detective McAllister. You know, you look a lot older than your ID picture suggests.

Can we ease up on the handcuffs then? I'm itching like hell somewhere on my face.

No need to shout. I get it.

Yeah, well, if you're here - why don't we skip the introductions?

Ugh, alright, fine. Yes, I can confirm that's my name. Yes, you didn't catch the wrong guy, it's me.

So you want to know why I did it? Why I did what I did to him?

You know when I was little, there used to be this grocery store nearby, and the popsicles were the only things I could really afford. All the other snot-faced fuckin' brats had their toys or whatever, and I had to pinch every penny just to save up enough for one a' those ice motherfuckers.

I'm getting there, be patient.

So, turns out, saving up money in my piggy bank until I can open it up again and count all the coins inside was the most satisfying thing ever. It's like, uh, kind of addicting, really.

And you know, I never liked him, not on the first day I saw him at my workplace. I bet you his fat ass sweats cash through those Tom Ford pants. He smelled like daddy's money from head to toe. He's got those hungry squinting eyes too, like he's measuring how much your organs would sell for on the black market.

So, uh, I turned him into a piggy bank.

I had plenty of spare changes lying around from all the money I saved up over the years, and even that wasn't enough to fill the fuckin' pig. So I kept saving them up. At first he tried to vomit them back up, but I could just force him to eat all the coins again. The teeth were a small cost. I must've poured 300 dollars down his throat. It was worth every penny.

Oh, there's gotta be a fancy word in your law books that describes folks like me, right? Or should I *coin* a new term for you?

Heh, I thought that was pretty funny? Don't worry, the fella is in *mint* condition.

Oh, he's still in the house. You'll find him where the flies are. Do me a favour and open him up, will ya? You know, let all the shiny silver and bronze and red mushy guts burst out of him? You know that feeling when you finally save up enough money and just break your piggy bank? It's the best feeling in the whole world.

Is he still alive? Of course he is, it wouldn't be a piggy bank without a pig, right? That's just common *cents*.";16192540090
I promise;526;25;"Sweat dripped down my forehead. The pressure was getting me. From the corner of the living room I could hear the cries of my two children, Tom, ten, and Diya, nine. 

They were hiding in the closet, just as I had told them to. Lying unconscious on the living room floor was my lovely wife Rebbeca, dried blood matting her hair against her head. But I won’t lose hope.

I leaped up from my recliner and shuffled to squat near the window for the third time in as many minutes and parted the curtains. The dead were out there. Standing behind cars parked in front of my home.

“Daddy, we’re scared,” Tom whispered.

“I know. So am I, baby. But I won’t let them get us. I promise.”

I picked up my shotgun that I had propped against the wall next to the window. I could start shooting in hopes of thinning the herd outside, but I knew the noise would only bring more of the ghouls to his home. 

I counted them again. Fourteen. All circling my house.

The masses were growing so were the Murmers. Its not like that they show in movies. These types could talk, plan to hunt us down.

The zombie’s booming voice squealed we are surronded, sounding like God himself, but God wasn’t in the business of killing and eating my family, as were the maggot sacks outside my once-quiet home.

Rebbeca’s eyes opened at once, she began to move.

“Tom, Diya” she said in her new voice.

I raised the shotgun, and aimed at her head. I knew there was only one way out for me and my family.

“No! Daddy, please! ” Diya cried.

“I’m sorry, pumpkin, but this is the only way. I will see you on the other side. Now close your eyes and hold your brother. Hold him tight! When you get to heaven, Mama and I will be right behind you, baby. Go ahead now, close your eyes, and wipe away those tears.”

I shot my wife first, then both of my children. As I raised the shotgun to place it in my mouth, the living room window shattered in. The shots had excited the dead outside, and now they were flooding into his house in hopes of getting my family. 

But I knew I had cheated them out of that satisfaction. I pulled the trigger as they grabbed me and dragged me to the floor, but nothing happened. The gun had jammed.

The zombies rolled onto my stomach and placed cuffs on me.

“*We were too late, sir. They’re dead, the wife and the kids. The physco shot them. Oh my God, he shot them.*” One of them cried.";16192599350
The Muse;22;4;" Tonight was a big night. She was going to complete her latest addition to the collection. She wondered how the painting would end. She suspected that as usual, she would inevitably paint on dark, shadowy figures, blending into and subtly altering the quality of the work.

She wondered how much of her art was still his. Could her repeated strokes, her intuition and muscle memory, have assimilated his art into her psyche?

She hoped that was the case. After all, she didn’t know for sure how long he was going to be around. Her work was gaining momentum in the art world, and she didn’t want it to stop. 

The gallery was within sight. She came to a sudden halt. She felt it, the familiar sensation in her palms. It was as if he were there in front of her, gently holding her hands.

She’d have to go back to the studio now, while he’s here. She typed a quick text to the others and hurried back.

———

That night, she felt him within, moving her hands, craning her neck. She focused on being curious and open as he occupied her body, to intuit his strokes, his movement, his flow.

After the last stroke of the brush, he stayed. She was intrigued. He hadn’t stayed in the past.

He wanted coffee. He hadn’t tasted the creamy, nutty flavor of a good cup of coffee in a long time. She felt this, in waves of emotion and intuition.

She had a cup of coffee. She could feel his enjoyment, an appreciation she had never experienced before.

He didn’t leave for quite a while that night.

———

In the weeks that followed, he stayed on for longer and longer periods. Their art work developed a softer, more nostalgic quality. And her adoring public loved it even more. 

He was almost always there now. Some days, when she did not feel like facing the world, she would retire into her mind, and he would take over, painting for her, doing her chores and her social obligations. It was all new to him, exciting.

He was always gentle with her needs, never overstepping his boundaries when in control. The months passed by this way, with them in beautiful harmony. Life was really good.

Two years later, he sat at the patio, contented, silent. He had had a great review from a top critic. Life was going his way. He ran a hand through her long locks, taking a sip of the wine she loved. In the quiet of the night, nostalgia took hold. They had been happy together. Truly. He contemplated spending some time with her. The last time he had let her out was a couple of months ago. She had reeked of resentment and quiet resignation.

He felt a twinge of guilt. He had been enjoying the past months, not once thinking of her.

Well, perhaps, tomorrow. Tomorrow, he’d relax his grip and let her emerge. For a nice cup of coffee, together. Tomorrow.";16193124000
Im’perfect’;22;6;"“And when they got home and checked the car door, there was a hand gripping the hookle!”  Kelsey was a natural storyteller, great timing, great energy, but I still hated the story. 

“Wait, didn’t the escaped killer have a hand? Fucking nasty!”  Doug was dense as a brick and just as tactful. “Oh, I mean—no offense,” he said looking down at my fingery limb ends. 

“It’s fine.” I lied. I tried to forget my abnormality, but they never would. I wanted to get the procedure. I wanted to be like them. A clotting disorder kept me from normalcy. 

Kelsey ran her hook through her hair—the combination of shiny rose gold and wavy auburn reminded me of my sister. Both girls were perfect. I curled my index and middle fingers into an arc and looked at my ugly hand. I was not. 


When I arrived home later, my mom was decorating for my sister’s sweet sixteen lunch, as her friends drank Chardonnay from straws. She held a roll of tape to the dining table and pulled at the free end with her teeth. A number of empty balloons hung limply from the walls secured with odd lengths of half-dangling tape. The house smelled rotten as usual—a victim of too many torn garbage bags and lost food. 

“Can I help with anything, mom? Your dress maybe?”  She wore her favorite dress for the occasion—one with a tasteful number of gouges. The zipper hung open from armpit to waist. 

“Chloe, if you try and make me look dexterous, I’m gonna lock you in your room.”  An empty threat, but the way she said ‘dexterous’ stung.

Mom frowned, shifting her attention to my appearance. “And could you at least keep your hands in your pockets?  Your sister and I have tried to make today perfect.” 

I loved my little sister, but after she had given up her feet for another pair of hooks, her commitment to her ideal began to seem obsessive. Her knees and elbows grew raw and bruised. She took to dragging herself across the floor. My mother said she was ‘perfect.’

“Chloe, actually, you can help. I’m gonna let your sister give the gals a peak at her little surprise. Would you take out the garbage and recycling? Can’t afford to drop an empty wine bottle with more guests coming.”

“Sure mom.”  I guess my ugly hands are good for something. 

I heard the delighted shrieks and admiring sighs of my mom’s guests from the bins. The surprise must’ve been great. 

My phone buzzed and I set down the box of bottles. An Instagram post from mom’s friend Janine.  I opened it. 

The picture was framed awkwardly as with most hook and nose shots, but she was there—my sister, posed on an armchair, graying skin and—five hooks. 

The smallest garbage bag I held was heavy, and as I looked at it, I saw a few wayward strands of auburn hair. 

The post already had a comment: ‘Perfect.’";16193110420
The Merrybell Well;8;5;"Merrybell was a small village in England. Every day was the same: quiet. Merrybell’s population consisted entirely of old people. The only time excitement spread trough the town was when Barbra’s grandchild visited. 

Barbra’s grandchild, Geoffrey, was 7 when the town got attention on the news. The townsfolk didn’t seem to want this attention— especially since it was Geoffrey who went lost. 

Geoffrey was playing in his grandmother’s garden one day, a path caught his eye. He wondered down the path into the forest. The path ended at a well. On a metal plate was engraved,”MERRYBELL WELL”. Geoffrey didn’t think much of it at first and wandered back up the path. 

“I’m back at the well? How? I walked up the same path I came!” Geoffrey said to himself. An echoed screech came from behind him. Geoffrey turned to see where the screech came from. 

A fifteen foot man-like creature with a thin, boney body and glowing yellow eyes looked back at him. It’s pale, grey skin gleaming in the sun. It’s long, thin arms dangling on the ground. It’s long, razor sharp fingers cutting into the ground. 

Geoffrey turned away and ran into the forest. The man taking big strides to catch up. He could see his grandmother’s home. He could almost feel safety when it disappeared. They were at the well again. The man took him and fled. 

All that was recovered from the accident was a button off Geoffrey’s shirt...";16193271030
Pinkerton's Model;51;8;"Ralph figured it would be an easy job. Break into Old Man Pinkerton’s place late one night, case the joint for valuables and slip away. Even if he *did* encounter the owner, Ralph knew he could handle a frail old man.

But he wasn’t prepared for the paintings.

Ralph stood in Pinkerton’s living room, flashlight in one hand and gun in the other, staring at the paintings on the wall. He knew Pinkerton was an artist who specialized in horror; he’d designed covers for novels and posters for movies back in the 70’s and 80’s. Some creepy stuff.

But these portraits were on a whole other level.

On the left, a man being devoured alive by rats in a filthy basement.

In the middle, a woman being burned at the stake while surrounded by an angry mob.

On the right, a man being lifted up by a giant marionette doll, wires digging into his flesh.

It was like a train wreck; Ralph didn’t want to look, but couldn’t tear his eyes away. The young blond man stood staring for what felt like an eternity, transfixed by the grotesque artwork. Despite the macabre subjects, Ralph could see Pinkerton’s immense skills with the brush. Each painting was so vivid, so lifelike.

He could almost hear the chittering rats...

Feel the heat of the flames...

Smell the sweet scent of blood…

Wait.

Ralph blinked.

The people in the paintings… were their eyes moving?

“Do you like them?”

Ralph spun at the sound of the withered voice, raising his gun fast.

Not fast enough.

As he turned, a blade flew through the air, opening his throat.

Ralph’s firearm and flashlight fell to the floor, followed swiftly by Ralph himself. He gasped and flailed, choking on his own blood. The beam of the flashlight shone upon the wrinkled face of Pinkerton, smiling as he looked down at the intruder, knife in hand.

“I wasn’t expecting company tonight,” Pinkerton said casually. “Had I have known, I would’ve tidied up the place.”

With one hand to his throat in a desperate attempt to staunch the blood flow, Ralph pathetically reached towards the blurry Pinkerton. He tried to gurgle a plea for help.

“Don’t worry, sonny,” Pinkerton said. His voice sounded distant, muted. “This isn’t the end for you. I will see that you live on.”

\---

“I say Pinkerton, this is your most ghoulish work to date!”

Pinkerton beamed with pride as he showed off his latest painting. In it, a young blond man was being flung backwards off a galloping horse, blood spraying from his neck, a length of razor-thin wire dripping with crimson stretching across the scene above.

“How do you come up with such ghastly ideas?” Pinkerton’s guest asked. The old man smiled and shrugged.

“What can I say, they just come to me. The other night I was struck by sudden inspiration and just had to start painting.”";16192905460
Oblivion;81;19;"Just like he did every evening, he knelt by the side of his bed, folded his hands, and prayed.

""Dear God, please end our miserable existence. We know not why you created us to suffer. Our rulers are sociopaths, your clergy are pedophiles, and your works decay into chaos. You let the strong dominate the weak; you let evil men succeed while good people struggle. You say you love us, but it's clear from observation that you're completely indifferent to our fate. Please admit your Creation was a mistake, and stop this madness. Amen.""

He frowned sourly as he rose to get into bed, for his usual fitful sleep. Unexpectedly, he felt the substance of his bedroom fade, and found himself in a softly-lit void, free from gravity or any concrete sense of space. Had he finally made contact? That seemed too good to be true. He felt someone was tricking him.

A booming voice spoke to him. ""You dare question your God? You are *ungrateful*!""

He was having none of this. ""I'm *not* grateful for existing! Existence is pain, and even the most biased observer has to conclude that evil defeated good a long time ago!""

The booming voice continued. ""It is because you have turned *away* from me!""

He glared into the void. ""But we're created in *your* image! Our existence, and the way we live, is a reflection of *you*! And the image it's reflecting is *awful*!""

After a pause, the voice was less booming. ""I'm...I'm trying to fix it. I've sent many saviors. They have done many good deeds, and lifted many minds from darkness.""

""Nowhere *near* enough!"" he roared. ""You can't fix this! It's too damaged!""

The confidence returned to the voice. ""But...but my creation is *good*!""

""No it isn't! You only *say* it's good! Your opinion is self-serving and biased!""

""How dare you!"" the voice thundered. ""In an instant, I could--""

""What, uncreate me?"" he snarked. ""That's what I'm *begging* for! And you think you can *threaten* me with that? You truly are a fatally flawed Creator.""

The voice ceased. He waited for what seemed like a long time. Slowly, he could hear light sobbing. ""I...I'm sorry. I know it's bad. I tried so hard. But it's gone so terribly wrong.""

""Then end this nightmare already!"" He was screaming now.

He felt a great shift. At the limits of his perception, he could see to the edge of infinity, and it began to implode. Galaxies evaporated; souls burned with flames whose colors were not in the visible spectrum. He watched the blissful end rush towards him.

Suddenly he felt a great panic overwhelm him. The voice trilled. ""Oh, no! I created all of you from myself! I can't *uncreate* you...I needed to reabsorb you!"" Existence continued to collapse inward at a ferocious velocity. ""I won't have enough essence to continue!"" The edges of infinity rushed towards him. ""I must stop this before it's too la--""

And then...nothing. Absolutely nothing. Even the absence of nothing.";16192623500
Matryoshka;1103;103;"When I’m crawling on the white padded walls she’ll appear on the cold skeleton bed with the grace of a gunshot. She’s so pale, lethargic features drowning in a bloodstained gown. Her face is a hole; a gaping wound still dripping blood and brain matter, and there’s an echo in there. A voice.

I reach into the hole with all my being. Feet first, then the rest of me follows, like a reverse birthing. There is comfort in the blood and flesh of her, and for a moment I feel like maybe I should think about dying. You know, really *consider* it.

But then I’m regurgitated back into that room. Under that bed. On that day. And I’m a little girl again.

I hear my father beating my mom to death with a baseball bat in the other room. You can’t unhear that sound. It’ll stick with you forever. You’ll wake up screaming every night, but your scream is the sound of that bat, tirelessly crushing the face of the one person you truly loved, and you’ll hate yourself for remembering it so vividly.

I am that little girl again, crying, trembling, cradling my father’s gun like it was a doll. I wince when I hear the approaching footsteps. I close my eyes when I see his feet by the bed. I count to one, two, three, four.

Then I pull the trigger. 

When I open my eyes I’m staring into the hole in his right eye, and I crawl further back to avoid the rising tide of the blood. I remember smoke coming out of the wound. Swirling in hypnotizing patterns. Beautiful.

Back when I was a little girl I spent three days under that bed.

But now, this time, there is an echo in the hole in my father’s eye. A voice calling my name. And I know that I must crawl deeper. So I start with two fingers. Widen the hole. Then a hand. An arm. Then the rest of me.

And I’m back again in that room. Under that bed. On that day. And I’m still a little girl. 

Bash, bash, bash her head in. Screams that aren’t human anymore, aren’t living anymore, and then they stop being screams. Turn to liquid. Cry, tremble, cradle the gun. Approaching footsteps. Wince. Close your eyes. Count to four.

Pull the trigger.

Open your eyes. Stare into the hole. A gaping wound in her face. Rising tide of blood and brain matter. Swirling smoke. Beautiful.

Echoing voice from within. Follow it. Crawl through her again.

Back among padded walls now, and she sits beside me. We’re finally at the end.

“It’s not your fault,” my mom says. “You thought it was him. You did exactly what I said you should do. Aim true and end him before he touches you.”

So I scream now into the endless white. Can you hear me? Is there anybody out there?

I understand what I did now. You can set me free.

Hello?";16192104960
Transport;231;13;"Oh shit. I’d really overdosed this time. The rings of Saturn were beautiful, but the drug would never wear off fast enough for me to survive.

I tried my first dose of transport about a year ago. It was a baby dose, I took it in my bedroom, not knowing what to expect. A few seconds later, I was on the other side of my room, looking at the bed I’d just been sitting on. A few seconds after that, I was back on the bed again.

I started taking larger and larger doses after that. I’d appear down the street, in other buildings around town, I never knew where I’d wind up. It was so exhilarating that I kept taking larger and larger doses. I started doing transport with friends, we’d hold hands and take a dose. Then we were somewhere else. Somewhere fun and exciting.

After a while, we were appearing in other countries all over the world. Exploring the world a few minutes at a time. The larger the dose, the further you’d go, and the longer you’d stay.

This last time I’d gotten the transport from a new supplier. It must not have been cut like the stuff I’d been used to. As I stared at Saturn’s rings, my vision started to fail as my blood started to boil. I pray that my mother won’t be the one to find my bloated, livid body in my bedroom.";16192358330
I have connections;8;1;"I have so many connections in many different industries and I now want to start helping people connect with industries of their interest. You know what they say that it's not what you know but who you know that can take you further in life. I now want to enjoy being the guy with all the connections and I also want to be the guy that can make people's careers and I have also watched people live a life that they weren't happy with because they didn't have any kind of connections. It took a long time to build connections in many different areas and professions and it makes me feel useful. 

If any of you want to step into the media field just know that I know a person who is in the media. I came to know him as I had murdered his parents and have been watching him ever since. Now and then I give him secret cards reminding him of what I had done and he becomes agitated. He is my connection into the media and when I say media I mean all media. He works in radio, film and animation. So anyone that wants a door way into these types of media just know that I know a guy within the industry as I have murdered his parents.

If anyone wants a door way into architecture just know that I know a woman who is an architect, and I got to know her as I had murdered her boyfriend. To keep this connection alive I remind her of me by giving her secret newspaper cuttings of her boyfriend's murder. She has many buildings under her name and she is quite successful in architecture and if anyone wants real experience in architecture, just know that I know a woman in that field. 

If anyone wants any door way into the fashion industry just know that I know a man in that field. How I got to know him is by murdering his husband and children. I keep the connection alive by secretly sending him video tapes of the murder and now you all know that I have a connection into the fashion industry. I also have a connection into the business sector as well as investment banking. It's a woman who owns many businesses and is also a investment banker. I got to know her by murdering her family and I keep the connection alive by sending her emails of footages of the murders taking place. 

I am always increasing my connections.";16192991070
Something Under, Mommy.;373;18;"“Mommy, I think there’s something under the bed.”

The mother brushed the child’s head and sighed, “oh sweetie, there isn’t anything there. Anything that could hurt you knows to stay away. Mommy’s here to protect you.”

The mother was wrong. The child was right. There was something under the bed. I stayed quiet, waiting for the mother to leave. 

“But mommy, I heard something.”

Impossible. 

“And what did you hear sweetheart? A bump?!” The mother crescendoed. Trying to startle the child, I supposed.  A quick, silly fright. There were much scarier things than that. The child had to get that. 

“No, mommy!”  The child giggled.  “I heard breathing.”

No. I held my breath reflexively. 

“Breathing, huh? Are you sure it wasn’t your breathing you heard?”

Yes, please, convince the child that it’s imagining things and then leave. 

“I know what my breathing sounds like, Mommy.  This sounded different.”

Fuck!  If the mother stays, then she might end up dead. I don’t want that. I can’t deal with that. This can only go perfectly one way. Now let the mother leave.

I hadn’t known about this peculiar little bedtime ritual when I got here. The house seemed normal enough, a little rundown in spots, but quaint. The floors creaked, which was off putting, but the child’s bedroom was oddly charming. I had barely gotten to explore it when the child and mother arrived home.  The child shouted “Bedtime! Bedtime!” I heard the din of footfalls on the stairs. I hid. Had it been known that the child would be so preoccupied with things under the bed—well, there were other, better hiding places. 

“Can you look under the bed, mommy? Just to be sure?”

No.

“I suppose so, sweetie.”

No!

The mother bent over and lifted the edge of the quilt with those long tapered fingers. Its protuberant bones popped at the joints and shifted beneath taut, sallow skin as it stooped further down to look. 

I tried to stifle my shuddering breath. I tried not to scream. All I could do now was watch through the gap in the door, trembling as quietly as I could amidst the hanging clothes. 

Sarah had hidden under the bed in the panicked rush to get out of sight. Now, she screamed and clawed at the floor as it dragged her out. The thing that the child called “mommy” ripped and rended in a frenzy, spreading Sarah in a clutter across the floor. 

“My goodness, you were right, sweetie. There was something under the bed,” the mother cooed as it shook stringy spatter from its claws. “But now, my dear, it’s time for sleep.”

It turned away from the bed and shambled toward the hallway door. 

“Mommy.”

“Yes, sweetie?”

“What if there’s something in the closet too?”";16192105000
Uptight;66;4;"For as long as I can remember I was always described as ‘uptight’. My teacher was the first one to call me it under her breath and I can recall asking my parents what it meant when I came home from school.

“It means you seem worried that everything needs to be right.” They didn’t ask who called me it.

I didn’t disagree with their analysis. I do appreciate everything being in its place.

This obsession lead me to sewing. Strangely it was a way for me to put things just as I wanted them and fix things I thought were wrong.

Childhood stuffed animals, clothes, blankets. I could make everything the way I wanted.

It wasn’t until I saw a student return to school after a biking accident and they showed off their stitches when something sparked in me.

That idea festered for years. What was once just an idea became a fascination then an obsession.

I masked it as a desire to become a doctor. All the videos I watched, and strange searches I made were now looked on as research for my eventual profession but they were not scratching the itch I had acquired.

But the thoughts only continued. I dreamt of pulling a needle through flesh. I could imagine the twine passing through the skin in intricate patterns before being pulled tight and sealing it all back together.

I would wake in the middle of the nights in cold sweats panting seeking release.

Desperate times call for desperate measures.

I took the kitchen knife from the block and staggered to my room the first weekend I was alone. 

I stared at my thigh. Mapping where the artery was knowing where to avoid any major damage before I wrapped one belt around where my leg met my hips. I pulled it as tight as I could and belted it to stop the circulation.

The second belt I bit and in one motion I cut them dropped the knife. The pain was instant and I bit down hard in response before I took up the needle.

I looked at the wound. 

It was ugly. It bled and I watched as the flesh moved when my leg twitched but then I started to sew. My hands moved magnificently.

I felt as if I was conducting my own symphony as the needle moved through my very flesh. As it came to a close I pulled the thread. 

I watched the gaping wound seal together as I snipped the cord and tied it. 

And years worth of desire was momentarily abated.

I sat there as the blood trickled down my leg and tears ran from my eyes and wondered how someone else’s insides would look?

Who could I find to cut open?

Who could I make perfect as I sewed them uptight?";16192431110

As I pulled into the driveway in a bus now fully loaded with unconscious school children I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought.

You told me to get a life.

We woke up today missing several members of our research team. After pouring over records, it was discovered that all the missing researchers were of African descent, apparently having darker skin. This should not be possible, as humans do not have dark skin. It appears the concept of different races used to exist, but was deleted by the wave. 

What is happening? What will the world be like tomorrow? What else will disappear, what else will we forget?

I Smell It Coming;26;3;"I thought I might have earned a brief reprieve from the agony once night fell, but my hopes were dashed when his thunderous footsteps shook the ceiling above. His approach was never a surprise because of the clearly identifiable, awful, skunky smell that wafted down the darkened stairwell before him. He stepped from the shadows and a beam of moonlight illuminated his sleepy, red eyes as he lazily took stock of the room. He saw me and a slight smile grew across his face as if he had somehow forgotten I was there.

The floorboards creaked as he shambled across the living room with his teeth bared. A deep wail filled the air when he stubbed his toe on a chair.

This was bad. There were no redeemable qualities to this monster, but all of his devious characteristics were exacerbated when he was upset. After several moments of whimpering, the monster kicked over the offending chair and angrily shuffled towards me. As he loomed large, licking his lips, I was suffocated by the dank fumes leaking from his mouth.

His slimy hands were only inches from me when he stopped. A gurgle bellowed from his hairy gut as he walked past me and into the bathroom. He was going for my wife again.

I wanted to scream: “You bastard! Leave her alone! Do with me what you will, but leave her!”

But I didn't make a sound. For most of it, I could not hear her, but rather the torturous howls of the monster. It was only at the end, before I heard him wash his hands, that my wife let out a single cry as she did every time.

The monster returned to me and let out a sickening sigh as he patted his stomach and licked his lips. A chilly blue light illuminated his bloated pink body as he ripped me open. I felt every chunk of meat that was torn from me and shoved down his gullet. He barely allowed the previous bite of flesh to be swallowed before filling his mouth with more.

Even an animal would have the decency to finish eating one part of my insides before moving to the next. But no, he would gorge himself on one thing then return it, half-eaten, back into my body to save for later. In between bites, he would greedily drink my innards and allow the sticky, red liquid to drip down his chin.

The horror finally ended, and I was closed back up. The monster lumbered back to its lair with the promise to return in a few hours. I have seen, heard and felt so many things that I can’t forget. I no longer yearn for freedom or even to see my beautiful, porcelain princess.

If someone somehow finds this, I beg you: *Please* put us out of our misery.

Two scoops please;1024;33;"First night serving up scoops behind the counter and my boss Franky leaves me alone to take care of errands. A crowd floods in, line out the door, as my seventeen-year-old nerves kick in. My hand sweat sticks to the scooper as my first customer approaches. An elderly gentleman with a baseball cap and jeans up too high over his stomach.

“What can I get you tonight?”

“Two scoops of the road please, extra nuts.”

I plop down a generous serving of the goods and make it rain with the nuts. After paying, the man drops in a twenty in the tip jar. A great start to the evening, as an elderly woman walks up next.

“Two scoops of the chocolate one with nuts,” she says.

“You mean rocky road?” I reply.

“That’s the one, darling. Give me some extra nuts on top. And don’t you go getting any older around here. You need to enjoy your youth while you can.”

My smile stretches when she places a crisp triple digit bill into the tip jar. Two customers in and already an unbelievable display of generosity. Next up, anther elderly man in overalls and a white mustache longer than his face.

“The name’s Willie. Remember my name son. Let me get two scoops of that nutty one.”

My jaw drops when he puts more in the tip jar than the person before him. A dozen more customers flow in; all of them look like they can drop at any moment. What’s odd though, is that they all order the same thing, and they are obsessed with peanuts. I head to the back to get a new tub, and when I return, I notice nobody is eating. Everyone at the tables turns their faces towards me.

Willie stands up. “What’s your name son?”

“Miles,” I reply.

“Miles, just do as your boss says tonight, and you will be alright.” Willie and the others take a bite of ice cream at the exact same time. 

An orchestra of choking noises pierces my ears. I look on, stunned at the wave of bodies that drop to the floor, gasping for air. The room goes silent, as I stand in shock. Franky busts through the front door. 

“Miles, he’s almost here. Help me get these bodies into the freezer in the back.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” I reply, eyes welling up.

“No time to explain, we have to feed it. Help me drag them over.”

I’m shaking uncontrollably, but then I hear a disturbing growling noise coming from outside, nothing like any animal I’ve heard before. I help move the bodies into the giant freezer.

Franky shoves me into the bathroom and joins me, locking the door. 

The floor rumbles. An overwhelming stench of death clogs my nostrils. I can hear the beast tearing flesh, enjoying its meal. 

“He’s gone. Take your tips. You’ve earned it, Miles. And I’ll see you back here tomorrow night.”";16191707040
Wild Spinner;14;1;"I have done things that no man should ever do. I do not want your sympathy. I just want you to hear my story before I reach my demise. I promise it will not be long.

They are lowering my body into the water. I am inside a well built glass box that leaves me cramped. A few of the boatmen are talking by the helm of Wild Spinner. They're glaring at me with disgust. These are the last faces I will ever see.

Another man is unloading the rope. My descent is underway. I am struck by the silence. The water is wonderfully vibrant. I am hoping it remains that way, but of course I do not cling onto that idea. I am terribly afraid to look down, knowing that soon I will be smothered by blackness.

And now I am very much apart of its existence.

There is a torch in my glass box. I'm wishing I could somehow get rid of it. Obscure beasts are rattling into the sides, preparing to devour my bones. Or maybe they are willing me free! Somehow, I think not. Their contorted and overly large heads, eyes visible from afar. Many are approaching me now. Circling me. I have to close my eyes. There's no choice. I promise it will not be long.

The largest beast of all just charged my way and has left an awful crack in the side of the glass box and I am squealing like a frightened rat.

I never should have done what I did. I am remorseful, and yet I am not expected to be forgiven. Not by anyone in this world, nor in the next, if I am accepted into it.

There is a timer above my head. There isn't much time left on it.

It has reached zero and the glass box has dissolved. I am floating helplessly, waiting. I am vulnerable to all that is around me. And I feel it.

The beasts are ready for me. I can sense them, and they are waiting to turn my flesh to bone, my bone to nothingness. I promise it is over now.";16192467980
Mr. Black;347;9;"""Five minutes remaining!"" Shouted Mr. Black.

So far, I was very lucky.

All of us glared at the centre of the table. Our eyes locked in panic, our bodies soaked in sweat, and all of us wishing for *it* to never stop spinning.


But it did. It stopped on Jessica again.

""Its going to be okay, dear."" Said Eunice, a frail 71-year-old with a bad-back and a gambling problem. Mr. Black had insisted we all share something about ourselves before the game began. 

We had come to learn that Jessica was a 26-year-old teacher with a 36k student-loan, that her Dad had recently died from cancer and that *it* had now just landed on her for the third time running.

She reached into the centre once more. She picked it up...put it in her mouth, and...

**Click!** Nothing.

She cried uncontrollably.

""Come on!"" Yelled Mr Black from behind.""You know the rules!""

She held the gun in her right hand, which was trembling phenomenally, and spun the barrel with her left. She placed it back in the middle of the table, and spun.


""Woooohoo! Wow! You're a lucky, lucky girl, Jessy!"" Shouted Mr. Black. He glanced at his watch. ""Four minutes remaining!""


His flamboyant and gameshow-host-voice that he was putting on, was somehow the most terrifying thing I'd ever heard. Every time he spoke, I thought I was going to piss myself. His chosen alias was clearly forged because of his all-black attire and black-mask. The mask served well in inducing fear, alongside his terrifying and manic, high pitched voice. It somewhat reminded me of the Mad Hatter.


""Three minutes remaining!"" Mr. Black bellowed, then pointed at Jake to continue.


Jake, 44 and a bank manager, also wimpered slightly as he learned over and picked up the gun. 

**Click!**...Nothing.

His spin fell weak, and the gun was now pointing straight back in his direction. Mr. Black sickenly chuckled to himself. I swear Jake was ready to pass out by this point. He repeated the action, and once again, was given the gift of life.


""Ha-haa! Well oh my God this is crazy people! Crazy! Just one, minute, remaining!""


*Oh god, one minute...okay, come on, take your time, Jake, and this could be the last spin.* I thought.


It landed on Matthew, the security guard to the bank at which we were being held hostage and being made to play russian roulette for this gang's pure sadistic entertainment.

They had their money and now they were just waiting for something. Their driver, perhaps...I still couldn't believe it; The entire time, it had not once landed on me.


Matthew picked up the gun...put it in his mouth, and...**click!** Nothing.


Mr. Blacks watch began to bleep over and over. The timer was up, but he simply silenced it, smiled, and gestured to continue...


Matthew spun the barrel, he spun the gun., and...


*Would you fucking believe it!*...Mr. Blacks eyes met mine...


I picked it up...I put it in my mouth, and...";16191812710
A weathered, withered window widens with a wicked wind;17;1;"He rocked on his porch and stared at the gnarly crab-apple tree centered in his back yard. Resolutely, he trampled along the coagulated path that stretched from upstairs to out by the tree. Upon reaching the fruit bearing branches, he plucked four and then set them in place, just as his mother had done.

Years ago, he’d joked about how crazy his mom was. She was incredibly superstitious. Black cats, broken mirrors, walking under ladders were all things she would pay very strict attention to. There was one, however, which stuck out more than any of the others. This one was the one his friends teased about more than any other. Nowadays, people would probably say she has OCD, but back then it was just considered nuts. Every evening, she’d check these spikes that stuck up on their fence. There was one for North, South, East and West. If the spikes had nothing on them, she would take one (or more depending) of the crab apples from the tree and impale it onto the fence. Then she would sing this song:

*Woven through with morning dew* 

*There is no need of fear*

*But when the evening blankets day* 

*And the pitch of night draws nearer*

*A weathered, withered window*

*Widens with a wicked wind*

*That without word and deed*

*Will not be kept within*

*A tether unseen ties the night* 

*To bind it to its spot*

*There to remain fast rooted*

*……Lest it be forgot.*

She instructed him and had him practice this his whole childhood, but he’d done it tongue in cheek and really did it to humor her.

On her deathbed, just before passing, she grabbed his shirt collar saying, “You have to keep this up son. Promise me.” She wouldn’t let go until he did and so he did. 

He kept his promise too. He inherited the house and soon was married. His wife thought him odd for this one ritual, but also considered it endearing because of the fact that he was honoring his mother’s dying wish. Soon, her midsection began showing signs of their wish for a family and they were both incredibly happy.

One early evening, she called out to him that her water had broken. He called the midwife while she settled into bed and talked excitedly about being parents and family. He’d only noticed that darkness had fallen when the knock came at the door.

*Shit. I forgot*, he thought rushing to open the door for the midwife. *Whatever, it’s just a silly superstition anyway….*

His thoughts trailed away when he stood at the open entrance. A dark breeze blew through him, shoving him out of the way. He heard a scream cut short from upstairs and then watched helplessly as the gust dragged his wife and child downstairs and out the back door. In that split second they had been distended, twisted, thrashed and mangled. He raced out to the porch and saw their glistening wake led straight to the tree.";16192373640
Mo's Misfortune;11;0;"Mo was a teenage girl. She had a good enough number of friends, she had a good enough number of enemies. But something was keeping her from enjoying life. She could always feel it there with her. Sometimes she could see it, but only a bit of it at a time. She had lately seen what she could identify as the thing's eye staring at her mischievously behind her shoulder as she was reading at the library. 

Sometimes, on rare nights, she would wake up; her breath shaky, her heart pounding quickly, her brain rattling around in her head as it tried to tell whether they were still in the dream or not, whether they were still there with her brother  Jason. On these rare nights, she'd hear it giggling, its horrible talons scraping across the floor. It would tease her, popping into her peripheral vision for just a moment, or casting strange shadows on the walls. On these rare nights, Mo hid under her sheets and tried not to breathe. 

Every day, she'd have a weight on her shoulders, slowing her down and covering her in a veil of paranoia and anxiety. She'd tell her friends all sorts of stories of ""the thing that's there that she can't see"", but they shrugged it off, changing the subject every time it was brought up. 

She would often wake up with cuts on her body in various places. When left home alone, she'd often accidentally injure herself in some way. The thing could only hurt her when she was alone. She would often be probed by her parents about the mysterious cuts on her body, but they, like everyone else, did not accept that a mysterious thing was the cause of all the lacerations that were drawn with haunting precision on her body. 

The thing would often try to cut deeper. It was rarely successful. Then on one particularly rare day, the girl's parents came home to blood and a lifeless daughter, still clutching the murder weapon in her cold hand.";16192431390
I couldn't stand it;49;2;"I couldn't stand it. Every time I got up, every time I ate, it was there. Always. Even when I didn't ask for his presence, he was there. 

Sure, we lived together, we were twins, but I couldn't stand it anyway. 

So I killed him. I laughed, and he laughed too. 


On the other hand, it was easy to kill him: I only needed to destroy that mirror.";16192075860
Untraceable;15;7;"It all began a couple of months ago.


I began receiving a series of random phone calls. All starting with heavy breathing, some odd scratching noises and a whispering that, I'll be honest, sent shivers not just through my body, but through my soul.


First off, I saw this as some sort of teenage prank and honestly, I just wanted to get the better of them. I kept answering, showing them it didn't bother me. 


The calls continued and after a few weeks, I changed my number. Regardless though, the calls kept coming, and after three times of changing my number, I decided to contact the police.


They set up a tap on both my mobile and my home phone and told me to continue to answer all the calls and they'd be monitoring the situation. 


After a week of tapping my phones and attempting to the track the caller, to no avail, and after no other signs of crime were being committed, the police decided to drop the case and determined it as nuisance phone calls. They told me they should eventually stop.


Over these few weeks, I've changed my number seventeen times.


So I dug deeper. I ended up spending all my savings and hiring myself a personal hacker/investigator. And I was told this guy is one of the best. But even he couldn’t comprehend most of it.


It turned out that if they rang my mobile, the call would be traced back to my home phone, even if it was off and unplugged, and vice versa; if my home phone rang, it was traced back to my mobile. But, even he agreed, as terrifying as it may be, there's absolutely nothing else here that can be done; no other crime had been committed.


Last week though, everything changed. The calls became much more real. Much more terrifying.


The heavy breathing was now replaced with voice recordings; little snippets of my girlfriend and I having a conversation from the previous evenings.


The scratching noises in the background had changed to a kind of muffling noise now, and the whispers had turned in to horrifying screams.


At 1:01am this morning, my mobile rings;


**""Hello?""**


I wore that, just-woke-up-what-the-fuck-do-you-want, voice... until he screamed down the phone;


**""TONIGHT I'M GONNA SLIT YOUR THROAT OPEN NIICE AAND WIIIIDE!""**


*FUCKING HELL!* I darted up in bed.


**""DYING ISN'T THAT BAD, YOU KNOW?""**


Normally I hang up on them, but this time, they hung up on me, this scared me more, and I was now fully awake for the night.


At 2:27am my house phone rings. I didn't answer, I let the machine it get this time;


**""Awwww...Are you not going to answer?...Don't you want to talk this time?...No?... That's okay, I can still see you...sitting on your sofa...biting your nails...why, don't, you, just... turn around...""**";16192255970
Jack;142;8;"

It's fun where Jack lives.


There's a game he plays daily. He calls it; **Shoot And Fly.**


Jack lives in an extremely rundown house that, from the outside, looks dark and mouldy, and on the inside, it's even worse.


Jack's house sits alone at the very top of a large hill. There's just one road in and out, and on the other side of his house, is an almighty steep drop. Five hundred feet, to be precise, which then stops at the road below. 


The road is a major highway, which curves and twists around the hills, and eventually out of site from Jack's house. This road also has a steep drop.


Jack's house looks haunted through and through. But it isn't. It looks to be empty and abondanded. But it isn't. Jack lives there.


Jack, and his gun.


Jack is 67, retired from the army, and bitter. Ultra bitter. 


At age 25, he stood on a landmine, which took both his legs, and, as he puts it, ""ruined his life forever.""


Jack sits alone in his house, day after day, playing his game.


Yesterday's score, which was 22 for 5, is his personal best so far.


He hopes to beat that today...It is the holidays after all.


From his window, he has a perfect view of the curve in the road. Especially down the sight of his sniper rifle.


The premise of the game was easy; shoot out just one of the tyres of a passing car, just as they're approaching the curve, and make them fly off the edge.


Some cars have lonesome drivers, and others have full families.


So, yesterday's count was 22 dead for 5 bullets. 4 cars with 5 people in them, and 1 car was an elderly couple.


Jack got carried away yesterday though. He's only supposed to do one car a day so to avoid suspicion, but now he's changed the rules...His own rules.


Jack is happy this morning. He knows that the holidays brings plenty of traffic. He stares down his scope, eagerly waiting.


*Wait, what's that?...Oh my...*


Jack's smile lit up his whole face. His thin and saggy skin stretched around his skull, and he became something more refined, more sinister, and he adjusts his lens to focus in on the *school bus* tyre...

""Shoot and fly."" Jack giggles...";16191818050
Balcony.;13;11;"I awoke startled with a sense of dread building and so I looked around my dark bedroom. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary and yet my heart was insistent. I realized that the room was not typically this dark and so I searched for the missing moonlight. My eyes rested on the glass balcony door. I just stared for what seemed like minutes. My mind not comprehending what I was looking at. I stayed that way frozen and slightly trembling. 

It finally clicked. 

A man.

There was a man on my balcony. 

I could only manage to pull the covers over my head. As if that would somehow make it better. As if my comforter could protect me from the tall shadowy figure on my second story balcony.";16192191660

Louvel's Plight;806;26;"*Louvel: Doctor, is it a full moon tonight?*

Dr Matheson: Yes, it is Louvel. Would you like to go over the dream again?

*Louvel: I-I don’t know Doctor, it terrifies me.* 

Dr Matheson: When did it start occurring again? 

*Louvel: On the eve of my 20th birthday.* 

Dr Matheson: Just take your time. Start at the beginning. 

*Louvel: I’d open my eyes and I’d be standing in the middle of a field, one I don’t recognise. It’s the middle of the night; the moon shines brightly, illuminating the withered ground. The tall grass sways gently in the soft breeze. I look around and I realise that I am alone. I begin walking aimlessly, my legs feel weighty, not like my own. The air is balmy, suffocating and I can feel sweat forming on my brow. That’s when I see something in the distance.*

Dr Matheson: What do you see? 

*Louvel: It’s a shadow at first, obscured by the tall grass but as I get closer, I realise that it’s moving. I stop dead in my tracks, my heart vibrates in my chest, sending shivers up my spine. Once my eyes adjust, I see an abundance of silver fur and a bulbous body; too large to be human. In the deadness of the night, I hear heavy, laboured breathing followed by a wet slurping sound. I can hear teeth grinding, chomping. Bones snapping like twigs.* 

Dr Matheson: What happens next? 

*Louvel: I move closer and I see a body, a human body. Mutilated, it’s flesh torn and crumpled. It’s a woman. Her face is obscured by the hefty form of the animal but something tells me she’s someone I know. Someone I love. I feel a sudden tightness in my stomach, an overwhelming grief like no other and before I know it, I am crying.* 

Dr Matheson: Is it an animal? 

*Louvel: It’s not like any animal I’d ever seen. It’s face is buried deep inside the chest cavity of the corpse, licking and guzzling away. I realise then that we are surrounded by ravens; menacing croaks escape their beaks as they pick at the flyaway viscera.* 

Dr Matheson: Can you see the body? 

*Louvel: At that moment, the beast stands and turns to look at me. I realise then that I am looking at a werewolf. When I see it’s crimson stained face I scream.* 

Dr Matheson: Why do you scream, Louvel? 

*Louvel: Because of its face. It’s fucking face, Doctor.* 

Dr Matheson: What’s wrong with its face?

*Louvel: It has my face. The werewolf is me. That’s when I wake up.*

Dr Matheson: Those aren’t dreams, Louvel. 

*Louvel: W-what? What do you mean?* 

Dr Matheson: It’s your destiny, Louvel. You can’t escape it. The blood, the gore and that undeniably wonderful *flesh*. 

*Louvel: What’s happening to me?!?* 

Dr Matheson: Something that happens to every single one of us when we turn 20, Louvel. You aren’t the first and you certainly won’t be the last.";16191266910
I'm going on hiatus;7;3;"Hey guys I am going on hiatus for a while and the main reason I am going on hiatus is because firstly, its not really for me that needs a break. The people I am starving down in my cellar need a break from me and maybe some food to keep them going so that I can starve them all over again. They are so skinny and I thought that maybe they need a break from all of the starvation and suffering for a while. I feel if I leave it for longer they are going to start eating each other soon. Maybe after the hiatus I will just let them starve and let them eat each other.  

 
The second group that really needs me to go on a hiatus for a while is the old people in the old people home. They are so scared of me and I always seem to sneak in and mess around with the cctv cameras and scare them. The old people are terrified of me and wish that I would just stop terrorizing them. Their loved ones hardly ever listen to them as they think they are just going senile and majority don’t really want to see their aging parents. I do so many horrible things to them like put things in their food and break things in their room and just in general shake them up.  

 
Going on hiatus will also give a break to all those people I am stalking and I am sure they just want to walk home or go somewhere without me following them all of the times. I am really good at following people and making them feel nervous and I also take pictures of them and leave them around places which I know they will go to and see. Stalkers like me take away the blessings of a good lonely walk and I know they are terrified of me. I am also great at hiding and not being seen.  

 
There are so many people who would love to see me go on hiatus for a while and I’m sure when I come back I would just go back to normal ways but I will definitely notch things up. When I go on hiatus there will be less kidnappings, less stalking, less torturing and terrorising. I do feel like a hiatus is something I need right now.";16192125770
Cancer Makes Us Say The Most Horrible Things;870;25;"""Fuck off! Just fuck off!""

I was trying my best. My husband needed the toilet and it was a struggle to get him there. When I did I asked if he was okay. That was when I was told to fuck off.

I won't go into too much detail but he was in the penultimate stage of terminal cancer. As I wiped him clean he started to cry and say how sorry and humiliating it all was. I helped him back to bed and sat with him just talking about old holidays. Soon after, he slid off to sleep.

During the night I lay beside him, hearing him fidget and groan. He was in a turgid state of unstoppable decay. I put my arm around him. He spat back in discomfort.

""Now I'm dying, you want to touch me? I wish you'd been a better fuck. I wasted all those years fucking a boring lump. I had to beg for blow jobs.""

I tried to ignore it all. I was only trying to help. I hoped it wasn't how he really felt. Cancer highlights how spiteful nature is.

I moved out of the bed and sat in the rocking chair. I had nursed all our children in it. He asked for me in the night but I let him be. It hurt to be told I was an inadequate lover after all these years.

In the morning he felt better. I told him what he had said in the night and he apologised. He said he didn't remember saying it.

I made him breakfast and sat in bed watching our favourite film, ""Island at the Top of the World."" I used to have a crush on Donald Sinden.

""I always wanted to go to Norway."" He said.

""We've been. Remember? For our honeymoon.""

He shook his head and accused me of lying.

The next few days were distressing. He was pleading with me to finish him off. The community nurse administered oramorph to settle him.

Our children would visit often. The grandchildren didn't want to come. That sick old man wasn't their Grandad. They wanted to remember him how he was. He got upset when I told him but said he understood.

On Sunday, I knew this was it when he called out to me. He was so emaciated, tarnished by bruises and bedsores.

""You did this to me you fucking witch!"" He croaked biliously. ""You put this horrible shit inside me!""

Cancer makes us say the most horrible things but it also never lies.

I was diagnosed months ago but I kept it secret. Nobody at the coven suspected either. I hid it well. I banished the darkness from my body by reciting ancient blasphemies: the most sacrilegious words ever constructed. The universe settled the balance by irreversibly transferring the disease to my innocent, unknowing husband.

As my beautiful man passed, I sat there contemplating how I could ever repent for this.

I didn't want to go to Hell.";16191149480
The Watcher;116;6;"Ever since I could remember, a man has been watching me. 


Everyday I would notice him, grinning at me from far away. He never approached me, or attempted to communicate, he would always just stand still, grinning, staring. 


Nobody else could see him. My parents told me I had an imaginary friend. Teachers told me I was daydreaming. Psychologists put me on meds, but that didn’t make the man go away. 


After a while, I learned to accept it. People born blind can’t truly understand what sight means, they just have to learn to live without it. In a way, I had my own disability, and I had to learn to leave with it. Since the man never approached, I was able to learn to ignore him over time. 


Nobody believed he was there, and I couldn’t prove it, so I decided to go with the lie. The only person who didn’t treat me like I was crazy was my father, although he acted stiff and uncomfortable whenever I brought up the man. “We don’t talk about him,” he would say, dismissing my follow up questions. 


The Watcher stood still at my prom, he grinned at me as I got my diploma, I’ve even woken up to his grinning face watching me through my second floor bedroom window. 


On the drive to move into my own apartment, I saw him at several bus stops. He’d be sitting on the bench, grinning as I drove by. As soon as he was out of sight, he’d appear again, at a different corner or rest stop, staring, grinning. 


Time passed. I rushed my wife to the hospital, excited to become a father of my own. The Watcher was there, staring at me from outside our 5th floor hospital room as I held my crying son. I fell asleep holding my wife and son in a tiny bed, and when I woke up to look out the window, the Watcher was gone. 


I adjusted to my new life pretty easily, but it felt uncomfortable the first few months. Over time, the demands of work and a crying child became bigger concerns, and I learned to forget about the Watcher. 


Four years later, I woke up to my son calling for me. I stumbled into his room, delirious from being woken up in the middle of the night, and asked him what was wrong. 


“There’s a man in my closet.” He whimpered, tears filling his eyes. 


I told him nobody could be inside, before opening the closet door. 


As I expected, there wasn’t anybody inside, but my son still gasped and hid under the blanket. I waved my hand around, hitting nothing but empty air. Looking down, I found a small note.   


TELL HIM ABOUT ME, AND HE DIES, it read, word written in red ink. 


“He’s still there, Daddy,” my son whimpered. 


“No, son, don’t worry.” I forced a grin, sitting down next to him. “There’s nobody in there. It’s just your imagination.” ";16191426470
MAKE WAY FOR MY GIRLFRIEND!;23;4;"This story is about a guy named David. You see… David was deeply in love with Lisa. Lisa felt the same way too… After they both graduated high school, they both made a promise. A blood oath promise. They pricked their fingers with a pin and drank each other’s blood making a promise that they will be together – dead or alive. 

David stayed in the community and worked in the assembly lines for a packing company. While Lisa went to college at the University of Minnesota. They did their best trying to make things work, long distance. One day, there was a knock-on David’s door. It was Lisa’s father. Her father said, “David, I know you love my daughter, but you need to stop seeing her. You’re stuck at a dead-end job, with no future. We want the best for her and if you love her, you’d break up with her. You see, we intend to have an arranged marriage for her, with a young man with a bright future.” 

David responded, “Yy...Yes sir. I totally understand. I too want the best for her. I will let her know...”

“Good to hear that, son… I’m glad we understand one another...” Lisa's father responded. 

And like that... David broke up with Lisa…

Weeks went by and no news of Lisa. David did the same old thing... Went to his dead-end job... come home... sleep... rinse and repeat... 

Out of the blue, David was informed that Lisa had committed suicide. Lisa was arranged to be married but declined. The pressure from her family to marry a man she did not love was too much and ultimately; she took her own life…

At Lisa’s funeral, David could not stop crying… Though Lisa’s father apologized to David, the damage was already done. Lisa is gone forever… Or is she..? Legend has it that David never “left” the funeral home that day – even as Lisa’s family buried her at the cemetery. 

From then on, local folks would see David every weekend at the funeral home. Talking to “someone.” When you ask David who he is talking to, he’d say... “I’m talking to my girlfriend. Isn’t she beautiful?”

It is said that to this day – at funerals in the Midwest, you can still find David mopping around like a crazed man talking with “Lisa” and saying things like… “Everyone please make way for my girlfriend, she is entering...”";16191691890
Essence of Youth;43;6;"I prepared the whole flight to endure my mother's chatter about herself for a whole week. I love her, I suppose, but she's a stone-cold narcissist. It had been a few years since I'd gone home to visit, so I expected her self-indulgence. What I didn't expect was for her to look the way she did. 

&#x200B;

""What, you don't recognize your own mother?"" she scoffed after I nearly walked right past her in the airport. I stood in shock, utterly flabbergasted by her features.

&#x200B;

""...How? Mom, what have you done to yourself?"" I stammered. She easily looked twenty years younger. The lines on her face had disappeared, her skin looked flawless, her hair was as dark and robust as it had ever been. Even in her prime, she had never looked as good.

&#x200B;

""Oh, just a little hard work and sacrifice,"" she said, as if that explained everything. 

&#x200B;

The whole ride to her house she never took a breath, talking about her painting career and gossiping about her neighbors. I kept stealing glances at her as we drove, still wondering how her transformation could be possible. We arrived after a half an hour and she ushered me inside.

&#x200B;

""You must be starving, would you like some supper?"" 

&#x200B;

""I could eat,"" I replied. As if on cue my stomach rumbled. 

&#x200B;

""Well, make yourself comfortable. I'll whip up something special!"" 

&#x200B;

I watched her bustle around in the kitchen for a bit, growing more uneasy by the minute. She must have felt my eyes on her and she looked up from her chopping. 

&#x200B;

""Something wrong, dear?"" she asked, holding up the knife, a grin from ear to ear. I glanced at my wide-eyed reflection in the blade.

&#x200B;

""I.. I... just excuse me for a minute,"" I said, nausea overwhelming me. I lurched out of the kitchen, searching for the bathroom. I made it to the end of the hallway and thrust the door open, only to realize it was her studio. I was about to turn away when I noticed something.

&#x200B;

Each of her paintings were of beautiful women that resembled her. There were hundreds. And there in the center, her most recent work still drying on the easel, was of me.

&#x200B;

""You found my studio I see,"" I jumped at the sound of her voice, ""Well, what do you think? Have a closer look.""

&#x200B;

I leaned forward, when the portrait's eyes moved I let out a startled cry.

&#x200B;

""What's happening, what is this?""

&#x200B;

""Well, see this was the hard work! Getting all those details just right... It's taken me a long time to get this beautiful... Just look at how many models I've gone through!"" she laughed, waving around the room.

&#x200B;

""No... no, this can't be,"" I cried, looking down at myself on canvas. I was surprised to see a smile cross her face. 

&#x200B;

""Oh but it is! Don't you see? Once we have our sacrifice... you'll stay beautiful too,"" she whispered, slowly taking the kitchen knife from behind her back.";16191587660
Boneless;91;4;"  

Last night I dreamt that I lost all my bones. I was a pile of pink muscle, sloppily spread, drooping off the bed like lava off a cliff. I felt my own weight anchoring me down. I yelled for help, but no sound came out. I was stuck. I couldn’t move. So I lay there all day. A pile of pink.

I heard a muffled voice call out from across my room. Do you know what happens when you don’t have a skull? I do. My eyeballs sank to where I could see my insides. I couldn’t focus on whoever was making that noise.

Days went by. I don’t know how I survived without food or water. Dreams, y’know? They don’t have to make sense. But every day I heard that same voice call out to me. And I could never focus on it.

Like my other dreams, this one ended too. When I woke up the next morning my mum hugged me, her eyes tearing up at the sight of me. I guess she must’ve had the same dream. How does that work anyways?";16191189210
I am a therapist;32;4;"I am a therapist, and I see many suicidal clients. I ""lose"" some, but that's not the ones that keep me up at night... It's the ones that I save who haunt me. 

Especially the murderers... You are supposed to report them, technically, but... Well at first I thought, ""well they feel guilty enough to be suicidal and come to therapy about it, they probably won't do it again."".  And statistically, PTSD is more likely to come from doing something terrible than experiencing it. No one wants to see themselves as the villain in their own story.

Also, what can I say, I like true crime. And getting paid for it? Come on.      

Eventually though, I started getting a lot of suicidal murderers coming to me. I guess I put off that vibe... or word got around that I wasn't a snitch. There are worse vibes to give off as a therapist, I guess. 

I enjoyed it; having people who literally got away with murder telling me their stories.   

But then the cannibals started coming. And I must say, maybe this is too much information (but over-sharing is my profession, after all) ... but it got me rock hard hearing their stories. Evolutionarily, I suppose it does make sense to be attracted to human flesh after all, haha. Not that I would ever do that...   

Anyway John, your appointment is for 10 a.m. tomorrow. I hope you have been eating fava beans and chianti as I suggested. They are good for your depression.";16191358930
Laugh. Step. Thud. Gone.;59;17;"Every time, it happened the same way. Allison walked away. Allison smiled. Allison died. 

It started again, and as always, I started it mid-laugh. It took me nearly twenty times before I could physically reconcile the laughter with the terror and grief without choking. 

“No, stop!” 

I had yelled it a dozen times before, or some similar variation. It was my default reaction when I couldn’t think of something new to do. She plants a foot on the street, smiling back at me and then steps off the curb with the other. Her second foot never hits the ground, the bus comes too suddenly. It all happens in three seconds, I know because I once summoned the fortitude to count it in Mississippis. The ‘reset’, if you wanna call it that, doesn’t happen for another ten. I ran to her the first time, but I stumbled and landed too close to the lumpy smear and single twitching leg that comes out from underneath the back tire. I can’t unsee that. That wasn’t my fiancée. That wasn’t my Allison. 

Mid-laugh. I breathe it in and lunge to grab her arm trying to twist my body clockwise. Have I tried this before? She looks confused for a moment and then... The tire of the bus always catches her foot just before the front of it knocks her down and under. Three seconds just isn’t enough time. The back tire bumps and I look away. Ten seconds is too much. 

Mid-laugh. “Ally!” I grab her arm and try to twist again. She steps and the tire catches her foot, the bus hits her with a thud, her knee bends to the side, there is a flash of terror in her eyes, she’s gone. 

Laugh. Step. Thud. Gone. 

Again and again. 

For three resets, I just close my eyes and do nothing. Without my interjection, she speaks. Did I know that already?

“I know he pushes it, but—“ There’s laughter in her voice. Thud. Gone. 

I try to strain my memory to remember what we were talking about, what I was laughing about. I try to remember the date, the night, us.  But again and again it’s the same—the flash of terror, the thud, the fall, the wet pop under the front tire, the bump under the second, the twitching leg. Again and again and again. 

Laugh. Step. Thud. Gone. 

Laugh. “I know he pushes it, but—“ Thud. Who is ‘he’?

I try to remember a time before this. 

Laugh. Step. “—he pushes it, but—“  Who is he, Allison?!

I try to remember—anything, but—

Laugh. Step. “—pushes it—“  Gone.  Who is Allison?

I try to—I try to—laugh, step, push!

She smiled as I bounded forward, but she stopped when I pushed. There was a flash of terror in her eyes. 

She’s gone. She’s gone!

My photographic memory;18;5;"I can't forget any image that once enters my head. 

Every. Single. Day. I vividly visualize the horrors I had since I was born. Those scary images, the videos, such bad times. Even the jumpscares that I relive. For the love of God, make it stop! 

Hell, I shut my eyes in fear and the images appear, but more amplified on the black background. I see these damn terrors in the pitch-black night. 

I wouldn't even be safe from sleep. These fucking videos replay over and over again in my nightmares! 

Let me tell you about something I saw. 

About 2 years ago I found this scare video, ""I Feel Fantastic"". It was an animatronic, humanoid mannequin. Much pale a face that it had, just staring at the camera, chanting with a stiff, robotic voice. I was terrified to my core watching the first second. 

Guess what? That shit plays back in my head, in my sleep, in the shower, in the dark of the night, with my eyes closed. 

I can't handle this, man. It's too much for me. 

I rush to my room, still seeing that traumatizing mannequin's face in my view and grab my gun pointing at my head, sobbing and screaming. 

I pull the trigger. 

... 

... 

I can feel myself lying down, the feeling of bliss. I don't see the memories anymore. Just pure black, a nothingness. A void.

So there isn't any afterlife, after all? I look to my right over my shoulders, squinting my eyes.

**I see the mannequin's face**";16191389160
Just a job;68;7;"I glanced over at my new partner Barry and could see the nervousness on his face. It was his first day working in the field after finally getting promoted. I prayed to god he wouldn't fuck up and get us in trouble.

We arrived outside the house a quarter of an hour early. I told Barry that his job was crowd control while I did the hard bit. I handed him a shotgun and told him to only use it as a last resort.

We walked up to the front door and rang the doorbell. A frail old woman answered the door and started screaming when she saw us. A bunch of adults and children came running to see what the commotion was.

They all backed slowly into house as Barry pointed the shotgun at them. I spotted a a seven year old girl in a flowery dress and recognised her as our target. She was trying to hide behind her mother.

There was a look of morbid understanding on the mother's face as we locked eyes. She stepped out of the way and told me to just take her daughter and leave.

I grabbed the child and dragged her across to the kitchen table before flinging her across the table. She started to scream as I removed my tools from my briefcase and began to cut into her stomach.

Her screams finally stopped as I cracked open her ribcage and looked down at the organs beneath. There was a small trickle of blood at the side of her mouth which was starting to pool at the edge of the table.

I finished up my job and packed up what we had been sent to collect. I walked over to the mother and handed her an envelope full of money as she wept uncontrollably while staring at her daughter's body.

We walked back out to the car and I felt something hit me in the back of the head. I spun around to discover the mother advancing towards me with a knife in her hand. Barry levelled the gun at her but she didn't stop. There was a look of surprise on her face as the shotgun blew away the side of her head and she collapsed to the ground.

I walked towards her body and quickly began rooting through her pockets until I discovered what I was looking for. She had also signed up to be an organ donor so I quickly reached for my tools and began harvesting her organs.

We received a notification from our boss when we got back in the van. They needed a set of kidneys as soon as possible, so I looked through the list of organ donors who had registered with our company before picking our next target.";16191124730
Perfect Girl;32;3;"

She moves in next door, next to my house. She was my new neighbor.

I like talking to her, she is so beautiful and was so kind. She was the perfect girl for me.

She went to school, had a boyfriend but what came after caused her trauma.

One day, her boyfriend broke up with her. When she went home, the wall outside her house was vandalised with red paint. On her doorstep was a box, she opens it and found her cat inside,dead.

It must have been hard for her so I paid her a visit the very next day. She was motionless in her bed, she tried to kill herself out of depression but she failed, leaving her paralyzed from the hip down.

I ask her to be my girlfriend and she cried while saying yes.

She was so nice,although

Although I spread the rumor of her being with another boy who is not her boyfriend

Although I threw red paint all over her house

Although I killed her cat and put it in a box

Although I planned it so that her chair would broke when she climb on it to hang herself.

She stills says yes. 

She is the perfect girl for me.";16191257650
The Time I Abducted Anna;31;2;"There's no right time to abduct someone. It's expected that you go about it once the darkness has surfaced, but I find that that takes away from much of thrill. Many of my best abductions have taken place in the afternoon, in broad daylight, in fact. The busier the street the higher the thrill. There is no excitement in waiting down a black alleyway, or by a street corner, for hours on end. Your mister or mistress must be *found,* not sat about for. Grab it. Own it. Use it. Simple? Simple.

So why Anna? Well, she was the most thrilling of them all. Anna wore messy hair, Converse trainers, and a blue skater dress. She was the ultimate test. And not in the typical sense. She didn't put a fight like most of them did. I even told her that she was to come with me to my car, and that there would not be any commotion made. I should've known there was something strange about it, about how she abided so readily. Anna got into the back of my car and put on her seatbelt straight away.

""Where are we going?"" she asked. ""Nice car...""

""I'll show you where we're going.""

I drove to the usual spot, watching her in the rear-view mirror the entire time.

""Can we have the radio or something?"" she probed. ""This is boring.""

I turned the dial, trying to find a station just to shut her up.

Then I jolted in my seat as she tightened something around my neck. I tried to grab it but it was no use, she was far stronger than I'd perceived. My reddening eyes checked the rear-view mirror once more and I saw her blacked out eyes and wide smile staring back at me, and between her clenched hands she gripped onto her shoelace. Whenever I tried to unclick my seatbelt she prodded my hand with one of her abnormally long fingernails, slicing into my flesh.

As she let go I gasped for air, put my hands around my throat and fell onto the steering wheel, honking the horn. Then as I checked back up I saw that the door on her side was open. But I could hear her giggling from somewhere, and she'd left her shoe as a souvenir.

Sweet Anna.";16191223910
Stacy's New Dolls;23;4;"Ding dong!

Stacy opens the door. She has blonde hair tied up in pigtails today, big, bubbly eyes and a face that is as round as a moon. She is as sweet as a honey bear and is one of my favourite clients to sit for. For so many reasons!

“Hi Stacy!” I exclaim. “Is your mom home?”

“Nope!” she says.

I shrug. Perhaps they left a long time ago.

I step into the house, following Stacy as she skips along the front hall, twirling and prancing like a little ballerina. 

“Let’s play with dolls!” she sings.

The playroom is large and airy. Stacy motions me towards a comfortable corner and brings out the dolls. They look strangely lifelike. Everything is just so *human* about them, right down to the tattered pink clothes they are wearing, crusted with red, to their grotesque smiles twisted on their faces. There’s even a stuffed heart buried in each of their chests, a heart that seems to quiver with life.

But they’re just dolls, right? Right?

“Those are my new dolls!” Stacy squeals happily. She gives me a demented grin. In her arms is a sewing basket. It contains sharp scissors, silver needles,  black buttons, and spools and spools of ruby-red thread.

“Do you like them? I got them this morning!”

Deft hands slide the thread in the needle. Little footsteps approach. She slides the needle in my skin. Blood trickles down my cheek. Up down up down, the needle traces my jawline; red thread stitching it shut. 

Then she starts on the eyes, stitching the eyeballs to the skin. Finally she takes the scissors. Carefully cuts down my chest. Pulls out the quivering heart, the gasping lungs, the stomach, the intestines. Replaces it with stuffing, including a stuffed heart. Then she stitches it shut with blood-red thread. 

My eyes burn with the pain. The world begins to swim.

“Now we can all play dolls together!”";16191286650

My girlfriend and I watched an advertisement for The Feast, it was a terrible idea;8;6;"Oh boy, what a year it's been so far.. The Virus is calming down, along with restaurants and pubs opening with cinemas opening soon to follow. which leads on to the story that I'm going to tell you today...



#

It's probably going to be a grotesque read for some people, so you have been warned about that. This is **not** for the faint hearted and I will go into some details about my horrifying trip.


#

I also want to clear something up: I did this by choice, my girlfriend isn't to blame for any of my suffering, but I understand if you would think that she dragged me into this..



#

So let me take you on a clusterfuck of an experience that I thought was a great time at first..


#


#


It was a relaxing day, my girlfriend Scarlet and I were chilling inside her house for a while and having a laugh whilst watching YouTube until a very strange advertisement came on when we were watching a video. I was a little bit annoyed with it, but she insisted on watching this mysterious advert out of curiosity..


#

The advertisement was not what I thought at all. in fact, we were really captivated into a voice telling us that there was an infinite supply of everyone's favorite food for two weeks straight. 


I'm going to try and repeat it, word for word just for you:


#


#


#

*We are pleased to launch our new delightful attraction called: **The Feasting**, where you can eat as much as you want in the span of only two weeks.*



#

*And the best part is that it's all for free! Just sign up on our website and tell us what you love to constantly eat, and we'll serve it up straight away..*


We were on the edge of our seats, imagining how the food would be organized in rows and rows served on a golden platter.


#

Our stomachs were telling us that it would be a great idea, it *was* only two weeks after all, it wouldn't do any harm to us, right?..


What could *possibly* go wrong with this?


#


#


We arrived at the place it was being held. The massive hall was bustling with everyone else who applied for the experience of a lifetime sitting down at their seats, whilst me and Scarlet were gaping at the food that was being presented in front of us: massive chocolate cakes and chocolate eclairs with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Honestly, it looked so fucking beautiful..


#


Then that feeling wore off when I saw what was going on with the people. They were fucking devouring with no break in-between.
They just,

#

couldn't. 

#

Stop. 

#

Eating!


#

They were getting fatter and fatter with everything they ate, slowly becoming less human with every dish.

Her name is Anna;1235;39;"**Entry 1**

*I am a mother.*

*Her name is Anna and she was the most beautiful thing. Yes, I know that’s something that all parents say. But it was true, she was. She **glowed** - there was no other way to describe it. It was like looking at the sun. Otherworldly.*

*I never remembered her father - guess that was the consequence of a drunken one night stand but the curious thing was, I remembered **nothing** of that night. It was like an itch that I couldn’t scratch. A misplaced, missing memory that I longed for like a newborn cub longs for its mother’s teat. But when I’d try to piece it together like a puzzle - Anna would cry for me and I would care about nothing else.*

****

**Entry 2**

*I’ve been feeling a little unsettled lately, like something isn’t quite right. My nights have been plagued by these awful, inexplicable dreams that leave me feeling terror like no other.* 

*I open my eyes and I am bound to a table; the thick leather straps dig painfully into my body and I can barely move. Bright, fluorescent lights obstruct my vision; the heat is intense, blistering my skin. A sweet, metallic scent lingers in the open air as my eyes adjust. I look down and my stomach swells and morphs; the skin stretches like an elastic band. The flesh tears in the middle and I am showered in crimson. From within, I watch a glistening, sinewy claw emerge. It’s not long before I see it’s grotesque body; the skin a sickening slimy green. My intestines are woven around its neck; the shimmering, slick flesh oozes. It turns to look at me and for a moment, there is recognition, acknowledgment. **It’s Anna.** She mouths words I cannot comprehend and then I wake up.* 

****

**Entry 3**

*Anna is not my baby.*

*She’s been...changing. I’d watch her in her cot late at night, her limbs swelling and contorting. Her tongue would writhe and distend in her mouth and her teeth...oh my god, her teeth. I’d see them in the dead of the night, wet and shiny; as sharp as daggers.*

****

**Entry 4**

*A few nights ago I woke up with her at the foot of my bed. Her round little eyes were wild, bulging; burning into mine. I sat, frozen with fear. I asked what she wanted, **”Soon, mamma.”** She told me.* 

*What is she?*

****

**FINAL ENTRY**

*I open my eyes. Bright, fluorescent lights blur my vision - a tangy, metallic smell hangs in the air like a corpse. I am bound to a table.* 

*I look up and see a swollen figure standing before me; it’s olive green skin shines and morphs in the light. I see scales, claws and razor sharp nails shaped like coffins caressing my skin.* 

*Someone is speaking. It sounds like a voice I know.* 

*”It’s ok, mother. It’ll be over soon.”*

*I hear another voice.*

*”Insemination complete”*";16190359300
The Marvellous Melodies Of Hell;17;4;"Screams - beautiful, aren't they?

My brother had a nickname for them - called them 'the marvellous melodies of hell'. He was a lunatic of course, raving about aliens living in our basement and the simulated reality, but being the naive fool I was back then I took it as the absolute truth.

He finally snapped two years later. The police found him at a bar one day, slumped over a dead body with a crowbar in one hand and a mug of beer in the other. He even claimed that a monster did it, can you believe that? The lawyer pleaded the insanity defence, but it was no use - somehow, the judge decided that he was 100% sane, despite 50% of the evidence saying that he wasn't, and sentenced him to life in prison.

It messed up my childhood, of course - that's what happens when you become a murderer's little brother at twelve. The other kids didn't bully me though, at least not directly. Instead they settled for alienating me, from excluding me from group discussions to spreading rumours that I was planning to follow in my brother's footsteps. They made me an outsider - but in the end, I suppose that was where they went wrong.

You see, in the years after my brother's imprisonment I haven't simply been stewing away, sobbing to charity and begging for scraps. No - I've been planning. Planning for the day that, when all the conditions are right, I can finally fill the hole in my chest left from years and years of loneliness.

That day is today.

It's a simple matter really, to sneak a weapon into school. Nothing too suspicious, like a crowbar or anything like that. A kitchen knife is good enough.

It is also a simple matter to kill a classmate. Honestly, I don't get what all the fuss is about. Those unrealistic television shows depict serial killers slashing away at the arms and legs of their victim, while I prefer a simplistic approach - just one smooth motion and they're left gasping for air, blood pouring out from their newly opened throat. 

Then, I perform the final act. With a flourish and bow, I grab hold of my victim's head and tilt it backwards, exposing his insides for all to see. The resulting sound is a glorious one, and I am reminded of a similar moment, one from all those years ago when I killed a man and framed my brother for it.

Screams.

They really are beautiful.";16191172890
My scary hide and seek story;11;0;"When I was younger about 12 years old I was at my friends house at around 9:30PM and we were playing hide and seek. I want to keep the privacy of my friends so I will give then nicknames there will be F1 F2 F3 F4. F stands for friend. Just for some background F3 was a girl who I had a crush on. 

While we were playing F1 was the seeker so I slowly walked to the basement, I was walking slowly because earlier that night I had stepped on a safety pin and my foot hurt. 

When I got to the basement I had to use my phone as a flashlight because it was full of boxes. I hid behind a large box. 

A few minutes later I heard one of my friends come into the basement I knew it wasn’t F1 because he was still counting, the person walked passed me and sat behind me. 

I felt them breathing on my neck which was odd but I didn’t care. I thought it was F3 because I could smell her perfume which was a really strong strawberry scent. 

After a while I heard F1 say

 “READY OR NOT HERE I COME!!” 

After a while I heard F1 find F2 and F4, then I heard F3’s voice from upstairs. 

I was nervous because if they were all upstairs, who was behind me. I then sprang from my hiding place and slowly began to try to stumbled my way through the dark to the stairs. 

I was hopping as fast as I could and I could hear footsteps behind me I had to hop on one foot to the stairs because my foot hurt, eventually I felt something cold in the back of my neck when I heard what sounded like a heavy person fall and say

 “SH**!”

When I got to the stairs I bolted up and told F3’s dad because we were at F3’s house. He ran down the stairs and flicked on the light. 

When he got down their there was a man holding a bottle of F3’s perfume and a large knife. I was horrified when I saw that and we called the cops and locked the basement door, when we were on the phone with police the man was banging on the door screaming

“I’M GOING TO KILL YOU! I’LL KILL ALL OF YOU!” 

Later when the police arrived they arrested the man who was in his late 20’s and had long black hair.

 He said he had been waiting for someone to enter to kill and apparently didn’t notice I was in front of him, until I started running. He said he would have got me but he tripped on a box. 

I still wonder what would have happened if that box wasn’t there.";16191248880
MIDNIGHT GLASS WINDOW CLEANING CO.;241;12;"  

“What’s the deal with the new window cleaners?” I asked Marcie, sitting next to me at her desk. 

The gentle squeak of the squeegee against the glass was the same as usual, but something was odd. Why weren’t the windows getting any cleaner? They were getting darker. 

“Hmm, maybe they’re using yesterday’s water!” she laughed. I couldn’t help but chuckle, though uneasily. 

That wasn’t it. For some reason it was unsettling, seeing them cleaning the windows but instead of getting cleaner they just got darker and dirtier. And yet the window cleaner didn’t stop, didn’t even slow down, just kept at it. 

“He’s really making a mess of it out there,” said Sam, the manager. He had come out from his office and indeed now everyone was walking over towards the window and looking as it became darker and darker, more difficult to see through. 

I decided to give a quick knock on the glass and ask the guy what he thought he was doing. Didn’t he realize he was painting our windows grey, almost black now, darker and darker by the second? 

**TAP, TAP, TAP!**

I banged my knuckles against the glass next to where he was cleaning and looked out at him through the clear window pane. 

Pointing at the black windows, I said, “What the hell do you think you’re doing exactly?” 

He saw me and walked over to the window where I stood. He stared at me blankly and then began to paint that window with his odd darkening solution as well. 

This frightened me more than just a little bit, since up close I could see that it wasn’t ordinary paint. I watched as each stroke with his squeegee seemed to dampen out the existence of everything outside. It felt like it was being erased, like **we** were being erased. 

I began to pound on the glass with my fists and the palms of my hand, sweating now, my heart racing. Turning around, I saw my coworkers and boss were staring at me, looking worried. 

“Don’t you see what he’s doing?” I screamed at them. “We have to get out of here!” 

The window cleaner was methodically making his way around to all of the windows somehow. I didn’t understand, it was like he didn’t need a scaffold or a lift to bring him up to our high floor above street level. He was just standing out there on the air! On my toes I could see over an obstruction that had been blocking the view of his feet. 

He was moving rapidly to each of the windows now, blackening them, darkening them, making us disappear. 

Sam tried the door and found it was locked tightly. He began to kick it and slam his shoulder against it, but it wouldn’t budge. 

We’re alone in darkness now. The lights went out and then our phones. We can no longer see each other’s faces in the blackness. 

And we’re trapped.";16190652140
My wife suddenly became interested in sparring?;10;5;"
When I married my wife last year she suddenly became interested in sparring and I couldn't believe it at all, she was never like this before I married her as she was a real girly girl. I have done boxing and Brazilian ju jitsu all of my life but ever since getting married and having a child, I don't have time nor the money to do them. It was the most hardest thing to let go and especially sparring, but ever since my wife and I got married and had a child she has been sparring with me inside the house! It's incredible and I love her so much more because of it. What makes her want to spar is strange though.

When I come home from work she is already angry and ready to spar with me by throwing punches at me. Ok she doesn't wear any boxing gloves or a gums shield but that's ok. I don't attack back but just go on the defensive by blocking, parrying, ducking and moving around. It's incredible. The baby cries a little in the back ground but that's ok and I'm so grateful that she does this for me, as I get to practice my defence skills.

Also another time she wants to spar me is after a night out and she comes home drunk accusing of me of many things I haven't done, and I then become excited. I love it when she is angrily drunk and accusing me of things because that's how I know that she wants to spar. She sometimes spars me while angrily drunk by using a knife or some other weapon but I don't mind as I get to practice my disarming skills. It's incredible and I am so grateful towards her for it. I thought my sparring days were over but my wife loves me so much that she attacks me from anywhere inside the house at anytime for whatever reason, to keep me practicing and getting good at sparring. Like I said I never attack her back as I am bigger but I practice my defence.

One day she annoyingly agrees to go to the gym with me for some training but in my mind I am going to get her in the mood for sparring. Our baby is being looked after by a baby sitter. I bring a bottle of wine with me to get her drunk because I love sparring my wife when she's drunk, angry and accuses of me of some stuff I didn't do. I tried to make her drink some wine but she didn't want to and then I get kicked out of the gym when she complains to the gym manager that I tried to force her to drink wine inside the gym.  

I'm so confused?";16191250780
Don't worry. How bad can it be?;15;9;"""Fuck man, i'm terrified. What if they really hurt us or something?"" whispered Matthew, my best friend since middle school. 

""Come on! we finally get a chance to be popular. How bad can a hazing be if its literally on the college campus?"" I retorted, slightly annoyed at Matthews caution. We had been social outcasts all highschool long and I have been *dying* to get a new start. As long as this dumbass doesn't keep bogging me down.

""Bro, getting through this one evening is gonna decide the next four years! Thes guys als have a great relationship with the sorority on the east side. Do you wanna get laid or not?"" I knew that playing the virgin card would hit him right were it needed to.

""Trust me, whatever happens we are in this together,"" I said while giving him a pat on the shoulder. He looked at me with renewed determination, smiled that innocent smile, and knocked on the door. 

Mere seconds passed before the door swung open. Before us stood Alex, the guys who had introduced us. He had completely changed after he joined the frat, he had a savage air about him. A lion on the prowl.

He looked at me and nodded and then just gave Matthew a sad look. I could feel Matthews resolve crumble.

""Come in, close the door, take of your shirts off and follow me"" said Alex. I tried to give Matthew a reassuring glance, but he was in full on panic mode.

We followed Alex through the dimly lit corridors and arrived at another door towards the back of the house. As Alex opened the door I could see an empty room with a semicircle of robbed men. I took a step forward and noticed that Matthew still stood in the doorway. I looked back and he shook just shook his head. *Fucking hell*, I thought, *can't you see its just an act?*. 

I grabbed his hand an pulled him into the group. The central figure took of his hood and looked at both of us. ""Here at *Alpha-Phi-Alpha* we pride ourselves on the commitment of our members. To join, one must have the heart of a Lion and be prideful of it. Tonight we are going to see which of you is the lion."" He said in a booming voice. I noticed the hooded figures nodding in agreement. For some reason I began to feel uneasy.

""What the fuck do you mean *which of you*?"" blurted Matthew in a panicked voice. ""Alex said we could do this together."" I could see Matthew trembling in the corner of my eye as a wave of surprise passed through the semicircle. 

""Well, simply put both of you are necessary so that one of you can join. Show us who is the predator and who is the prey."" Stated the man coolly as he tossed a rock at our feet. 

*Pfff, this is just some stupid scare tactic*, I thought, *all we have to do is show our loyalty by rejecting this stupid proposal.*

I glanced sideways to give Matthew a reassuring smile.

All I saw was a rabid look in his eyes as he shakily clutched the stone.";16191149080
Eternal Bureaucracy;325;44;"“Name.”

“Huh?”

“What are you, deaf? Give me your name.”

“I..uh..why don’t I remember?”

“Because you’re stupid, mostly. But also because you’re dead. Think harder.”

“I’m dead? Oh god, oh Jesus, oh shit, oh god...”

“None of those are going to help you now. Let me get you started. Your name is Krisstupher, spelled the most pretentious way you could imagine. Now listen. I’m here to process you.”

“P...process me?”

“Big word, I know. Yes, process. There’s only one thing that’s certain in life and death - bureaucracy.”

“But...how did I die?”

“You’re not going to make this easy, are you? You were coming back to work from a mid-day drink, as usual. You slapped the nearest woman’s ass and kept walking. When she yelled, you turned around and walked backwards, winking at her like a hotshot, and strolled right into the street, smack between a parked bus and a dump truck going about 20 over the limit. You really should’ve seen it, Kriss. It was like watching Picasso paint. Or Leonardo. Or whatever Ninja Turtle paints, I don’t know. Your body erupted into a puff of fine, red mist. A spatula peeled away the only identifiable remains off the truck’s bumper. The forensics officer projectile vomited in her mask. They had to fight off the rats with shovels, Kriss. A cacophony of fluids and shards. It was beautiful.”

“What the FUCK!?”

“Setting it up wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. You were a giant asshole to everyone and nearly ruined your family’s company and livelihood. I’m usually neutral, but this was well-deserved. I’m just about done with the paperwork, please bear with me.”

“Paperwork? What the hell is this, some kind of prank? Am I being Punk’d?”

“Do I look like Ashton Kutcher? Thank you, but no, Kriss, you’re not being Punk’d, you early 2000s asshole. Someone paid dearly for your fate, and SkulkAfterlife takes its business very seriously. Some might even say we’re DEAD serious, haha.”

“Listen, if someone paid for this, I’ll pay double. No, triple. No, QUADRUPLE. NO, FIVETUPLE. WHATEVER IT TAKES, MAN, JUST LET ME GO!”

“We don’t transact in money, Kriss. We go deeper than that. Bitcoin, at least.”

“Are you shitting me?”

“...fine, no humour I guess. And since you’re too stupid to get the hint, someone gave their eternal existence, their forever fate, their beyond-earth body...their soul, Kriss. Someone sold their soul to have you killed and processed in our Platinum Package.”

“Platinum...what??”

“You get the VIP treatment, Kriss. You have a customized death, and dedicated spot, visible for all to see, where you will face unspeakable pain for the rest of eternity at the hands of the person who paid for it.”

“WHO?! WHO WAS IT?! I WON’T LET THIS HAPPEN! DON’T YOU KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS?!”

“Yes, I do. Kriss, your father was the one who ordered this. Have fun, and don’t forget to rate us on Yelp!”";16190513090
Meeting Grandpa;93;6;"When I finally met my birth mother at the park where we had agreed to meet, I  hugged her and after some preliminary talk asked her the single question that had been on my mind since childhood. The words caught but I  forced them out. “Did you give me up because I was too sickly and deformed.”
She hugged me again and whispered , “No child I wanted you, but circumstances at the time wouldn’t let me keep you.”
I pulled away a little and looked at her. She was beautiful and though my eyesight wasn’t great, I could tell we resembled each other but showed no signs of the deformities I had born since birth.  
“Come back to the house and let me introduce you to the rest of your family.” She said.  

I hesitated briefly but agreed and stood awkwardly on my good leg and walked slowly up the street with her. We reached the stately brownstone, a 10 minute walk from the park bench, I looked at the front steps and almost gave up before I tried.  I’ve got you,” said my… mother? What do you call the woman who gave you up at birth and have only just met? She put her hand on my back to steady me and I slowly hobbled up the steps. 

Inside the beautifully finished entry I saw an old fashioned sitting room to one side and a library a little further down the hall. 

“This is where I grew up.” she said. “And where you were born.”  I looked at her in surprise.  “I was born here? In this house and not at a hospital?” 

“Yes,” she replied pointing. “Just upstairs.”  I regarded the long gracefully curving staircase and knew I would never see the upstairs. 

“Please make yourself at home,” she said pointing to the sitting room. “Let me just go get Father.”

She walked down the hall towards the back of the house and I hobbled in and took a seat on what appeared to be an antique Victorian era chair facing the fireplace.  In a moment I turned to see her pushing a wheel chair in which an ancient man sat. 

He glared at me menacingly. “I told you it would be back,” He said without taking his eyes off of mine. “Are you going to finish it off this time?”

“I’ll do no such thing!” said my mother… that’s what I’ll call her I decided, relaxing a bit.  “And you’re too old to make me do anything anymore so there.” 

To me she turned and said,  “This is the rest of your family. My Father… and yours.”";16190705160
Airborne;78;6;"It started with a sniffle.

Just as he was passing Georgia I-20 Exit 99, Kiefer McKeeby, that two-timing, disloyal, traitorous man-whore and swindler extraordinaire, who—according to his wronged, soon-to-be-ex-wife, Angie—was also a “Grade-A, certified P.O.S.,” had hit a rather dense cloud of ""Georgia Snow,"" a.k.a. pine tree pollen. Now Kiefer didn't have any allergies to speak of, understand? He'd grown up to be the rat bastard that he was while running through the local forests and fields of the Peach State, breaking hearts as the second-string quarterback of his high school football team. Therefore, when his beat-up jalopy of a pickup truck emerged from the other side of the pollen, he didn't think much of it. On the other hand, he also didn't think much of it when he was fooling around with that harlot from Macon, Joanne Montgomery.

Anyway, as things went, his truck had gone maybe three or four miles past the aforementioned cloud of ""Georgia Snow"" when he started sneezing. A couple miles later, they weren't just little ones, mind you. No, they were big, whopping sneezes, the kind where you have to try with all your might to keep your eyeballs from popping out of their sockets. The kind where you pray to God Almighty that you don't swerve into that eighteen-wheeler to the right, as you speed past at 95 miles an hour.

And they kept coming, worse and worse. Soon blood and soft tissue were spouting from his nose. A tooth flew from his mouth, for some God-forsaken reason. In fact, the sneezes were so bad that Kiefer, who—according to his own reckoning—”ain't no pussy,” thought about pulling over. Only problem was that there wasn't much shoulder here on this section of the freeway. Not much of one, at all. Not that he could—

Wait! There's an opening and a way which catches his eye. A split second later, the violently-heaving Kiefer is attempting to dodge a pair of massive tractor trailers onto a widening shoulder, but suddenly realizes he can’t take his foot off the gas pedal. As his dim brain begins to realize the precarious nature of his situation, he watches in abject horror as the speedometer ticks up the miles per hour.

95…100…105…110. The truck is shaking now. Dirt spews from beneath the vehicle, as he draws closer to a hump of earth that he can't see through his sneezes. Still the speed increases until he's…

*…airborne…*

...sailing through time, space, and Georgia sunshine; rocketing right into the trunk of a massive pine tree.

Miles away, heartbroken Angie cries into the shoulder of her newest best friend: her spiritual advisor and confidant, Madam Zenga, recently-arrived from that great city of New Orleans; who happens to be incredibly gifted in the arts of voodoo, remote manipulation, and summoning of convenient natural contrivances, like pollen clouds. In the voodoo priestess' words, “Goodbye heartbreak, goodbye Kiefer, and good riddance.”";16190575120
Welcome to Ferus Outpost!;35;2;"Welcome to Ferus Outpost!

Welcome!  You have been assigned to Ferus, known for its blistering heat and blinding suns, so bring sunglasses!  We hope you enjoy your time working with us as much as we do, but please read over these rules to enjoy a safe and happy stay!

-The Outpost Team

1. Use your map to navigate the complex.  With multiple suns, you cannot rely on shadows to hide in if you stray off course.

2. It has come to our attention that the inside of the complex is very hot, but please don’t take off your uniform.  Any living thing without a special heat signature exclusive to our uniforms will be incinerated.  Again, this is for your safety.

3. If you hear shaking and feel the complex rock back and forth, know that our complex has state of the art shock absorbers and will not fall no matter how hard they shake! 

4. If you hear a voice calling for you, don’t look down.  Slowly walk toward the nearest alarm and gently press it.  Our staff will be notified immediately and seal off your area.  Better one death than two.

5. At the Ferus Outpost, your safety is very important to us, but we are a little bit understaffed, so you will be asked to perform multiple duties per day.  We are aware that doing so may shorten your lifespan greatly, so work at your own risk.

6. There is no water on this planet.  Thankfully, we have supply ships that come every month.  Nearly one in three make it to the outpost, so don’t worry!

7. Eating off-site is extremely dangerous!  If you are hungry, so are they.

8. You might be tempted to throw the trash out all at once into the lava, but please follow our procedures and only drop one piece every ten minutes.  Using our method ensures that it won’t ever wake up.  This information was gathered with the lives of three other workers here.

9. You are allowed to enter the security room, but if the door is closed, don’t open it! Our security staff work very hard for your safety.  Never disturb them, because they lost their minds years ago.

10.  Lastly, know that you won’t be returning to Earth anytime soon, so get used to the outpost.  If you are still reading this without your breathing mask on, chances are that you are already succumbing to the heat.  Seeing double is the first sign.

Someone Close;129;8;"The neighbours complained of a foul smell. The knocks on the doors and calls on the phone went unanswered, police were called to investigate when the smell grew unbearable. I knew when I stepped in, the smell of death it was.

Assistant Chief-inspector Cameron analysed the following:

 9 Days of decomposition and considerable insect activity, 

The name was Boron Shiamoni, aged thirty-nine, according to his driving licence. 

His abdomen was punctured with multiple holes slightly small than a 1 rupee coin, sections of his skin had been peeled away in strips three inches long by a quarter-inch wide as if someone had used a vegetable peeler on him.

I squatted next to him. “Death from internal bleeding and septicaemia. Murder, definitely”

I looked for other clues, but there was no sign of forced entry, nothing was apparently missing, the safe was locked and the dust on it proved it was untouched.

""Maybe it was someone close to him, maybe murderer had access to the keys"" I brainstormed.

&#x200B;

Cameron handed me the man’s wallet. “I doubt that; Have a look in there.”

I opened it. “Two thousand hundred cash. Silver credit card. Not a robbery then.” I looked up. “What am I supposed to see?”

“There’s a receipt tucked behind the credit card.”

I pulled it out. “The Khmer Rooftop Restaurant? That’s the *Cambodian restaurant* on Millside, isn’t it?”

“Yes, and one of their specialities is *A-PING*. Fried Trantalulas  and served with cheese”

“Ew. What’s that got to do with his death?”

Cameron pointed at one of the holes with his scalpel. “The spider is supposed to be cooked” He looked at me directly ""Cooked properly"" 

He took several deep breaths. Slashed the abdomen skin with the scalpel and along with dried blood appeared a nodule of the web, with small white eggs entangled. 

And out of sudden, a hairy leg flapped out, one of the legs of tarantula, tearing apart the skin, constantly flapping making a brimming noise as it attempted to make its way out.

Cameron jumped back at once.

“That’s where the spider harvested skin for a hive.” Cameron looked up. 

“I’d check the loft very carefully if I were you,” I said as He packed away his tools.";16190373180
Escape;107;10;"13 years, that’s the amount of time I’ve been physically and mentally abused by my dad. He keeps me in his basement and keep hitting me days after days.

I just wish I could escape.

One day, he forgot to lock the door so I snuck out and was able to enjoy my freedom. While walking on the street, a police officer came to me and ask.

“Where are your parents? You shouldn’t be out this late at night”

I was scared, I didn’t want to go back there.

“I—-umm”

Then I heard his voice

“Oh son, why did you run out of here,did you sleep walk here again?”

It was him

The police officer didn’t suspect a thing and my dad took me back home. 

He threw me into his basement, start hitting me over and over.

“DID YOU THINK YOU COULD ESCAPE?” he yelled

Then, I felt sleepy, I closed my eyes.

I open my eyes again and was greeted by lights shining into my face. A woman hold me in her arms.

I can’t speak, only crying, I feel alive.

“Congratulations, it’s a baby boy” I heard someone said in what seems like a surgeon outfit.

After that, a man came to me, hold me in his arms, he whispers into my ears.

“Did you think you could escape?”";16190383800
Big Boned;979;31;"My parents always told me I wasn’t fat, I just had big bones. 


That helped a little, but kids still made fun of me when I tried to explain myself. I was late bloomer puberty wise; I still had the baby face going for me junior year of highschool, fat that jiggled hanging off my waist, standing inches below some of the shortest guys.


I woke up one morning, skin itchy and sore. This is it, I realized. I’m starting puberty, finally. No more walking around as the short fat baby faced nobody I was. I could finally grow into the man I was supposed to be. 


Weeks later, I didn’t have much to show for it. Little stubs of beard and chest hair poked in, but I only grew about an inch. For how sore my joints and muscles were, I figured there had to be more tangible impacts revealing themselves soon. 


The doctor was stunned. The X-ray revealed that my skeleton was growing exponentially faster than the rest of my body. In fact, the bones inside my body were really the only thing increasing in size. The doctor ordered some strange blood tests, then told me to come for weekly check ups. 


He was right to order that. Another month later, we had no explanation, but I did have several lesions. Bones began to break out from inside my skin, poking out and exposing themselves to the surface. Finger and toe joints extended past my digits, making it painful to grab the simplest thing, or even just get up and walk around. My teeth were far too big for my mouth, I constantly had to inhale with my mouth wide open, closing it was too painful. Random patches of skin have been worn away from below, causing smaller parts of larger bones to peak outside the skin. 


I was on several antibiotics, and had to be cleaned daily to prevent infection. I stayed at the hospital all the time now, my parents could visit everyday at least. I’ve been laying the same bed for days now, just walking around is far too painful to undertake. Even getting moved around in bed to avoid sores hurts. 


The doctor came in a few hours ago. He said at the rate my skeleton is growing, I would shred through my remaining skin within a week. They had no plans to stop it, but they were going to run some last minute bone marrow tests. 


“I wish I was just the short, fat nobody I was before.” I choked back a sob as I confessed this to my mother, feeling the salty tears sting my cheekbones.


Tears ran down her face, She grasped my hand, causing me to wince in pain. “I do too.” 


We sat in silence, knowing the end could come soon. ";16189912460
Do Not Wake My son;116;10;"The car alarm had been screaming for a good twenty minutes or so and I felt like I was going insane. My son had begun to stir in his sleep, and the last thing I wanted was for him to wake-up and we'd have to go through all this again.

He looks so peaceful.

When he's awake though, he's a goddamn handful, far worse than any other one year old. But this, *this,* is heaven right now, and I'll be damned if I'm going to let a stupid car alarm spoil that.

I scooped the little-devil up in my arms and moved him to a different bedroom. He began to stir with my awkward movements, which, in turn, made me more awkward.

*Oh God, please dont wake-up!*

I managed to get him to the next bedroom without him waking. I let out an almost silent but well deserved exhale. I left the room, *slowly* closed the door, and finally let my lungs relax.

I pressed my right ear flat against the door to double check I was still good...I was.

Just as I was walking down the stairs, the door-bell rang.

*That goddamn door-bell!*

It was so loud, at least it was to me, that I not only jumped because of the sudden loud chimes, but because it was yet another opportunity for him to wake-up. 

It was my friend, Tina.

""Woah."" She said, flatly. ""I'm sorry but you look awful, hun.""

""Jeez, thanks Tina."" I pulled the door half closed as to subliminally shut her out. I didn't want her to come in and make any noise.

""When was the last time you slept, huh?""

I shrugged my shoulders then wiped my eyes. I honestly couldn't remember.

""He's been acting up again, hasn't he?...Come on, let me in, you go to bed and ill take care of...""

""No!...I mean, no, I'm fine, honest,."" I closed the door even more.

""Okay hun, I can tell you're not up for company so I'll leave you be. But I'll call in a couple of hours, okay?""

""NO! No ringing!"" The rage that kept trying to explode out of me was getting harder and harder to fight. I just wanted her to leave. She could wake him any moment now.

""Ermm-oo'kay, no ringing."" She shuffled her feet uncomfortably. ""I'll check up on you in a few days then.""

*Finally.*

""That's great, see-you then.""

And just like that, I shut her out.

Silence filled my home with an emptiness I had never experienced before. It was almost humming within my ears. Humming a song that was equally sinister as it was beautiful.

I strained my ears listening out for him. I didn't want to do it again.

Thirty minutes passed. Nothing.

Another 30 minutes. Still nothing.

Another hour. Zilch.

Three hours...

Four hours...

Five...

six...

It was roughly around the 12th or 13th hour that I actually finally relaxed.

This time, we didn't have to do it again. *This* time, the medication worked.";16190233680
My time to shine;20;2;"&#x200B;

I am the little boy my dads are supposed to be proud of. They say, when my moment comes the whole world is going to stand still and be in awe of what I achieve. They say, that I am going to save humanity (as if anything could). I am just the little boy who wants to live his life, but I suppose that’s my life, to save humanity, to rule over everyone’s heart, to write my own history and trust me I am going to write my own history, history that will never be forgotten.

To say my dads’ expectations of me are high is an understatement. They say that they have spent their entire lives for this moment, for MY moment. And I know I am not going to disappoint them.

This has been my entire existence. They say that my upbringing has nothing but the highest form of science humanity has control over. They say that at my fullest I can even rival God. Can you imagine, a creation matching the strength of the Creator? Its hard for me too.

My dads have always insisted that once the world knows about me, all the conflict is going to end.

I think this is all I had to say, all I needed to say before I fall upon this city. Before I kill countless people to save countless others, before I create my own history, before I become God Himself. Before I ruin the lives of these people and their children forever, before I change the way humanity perceives war forever.

I just know that this is my calling and falling upon this city is: 

My time to shine";16190551390
My Mother's Warning;172;13;"My mother rested on her pillows, gazing dreamily up at the speckled ceiling tiles as if at a night sky full of stars. She was listening to me read aloud from our favorite book, *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.*

Mom had been getting worse lately. She didn’t recognize me, and when she awoke in her bed in the care home she looked about wildly and cried out for her mother. 

But one thing stayed the same. Whenever I read to her Alice’s adventures, her eyes would shine like a child’s and she’d listen in contentment until she became tired and fell asleep.

I looked up from the book to see that her eyes were closed, her breathing slow and steady. 

“Goodnight Mom,” I whispered. 

Just as I turned off the light and was about to leave the room, she called me by my name for the first time in months. 

“Alice.”

Hope fluttered to my chest. “Yes, Mom?”

“Be careful, sweetheart,” said her voice in the dark. I waited to hear if she said anymore, but was only met with light snoring.

I had mixed feelings as I bid the nurses goodnight. I felt unsettled and distracted the entire time as I drove the ten miles to my house. 

At an intersection, the driver of the pickup truck behind me honked loudly until I realized the light had turned green. The aggressive honking and the look of irritation on the driver’s face upset me. I made a wrong turn and got lost in the winding streets. 

It was almost time for dinner when I finally made it home. I rushed out of my car, knowing how particular George was about having meals exactly on time.

“I’m home,” I called out loudly as I took off my shoes. George didn’t answer. “George?”

I went through every room of the house calling out for my husband, but couldn’t find him anywhere. When I called his phone, it rang from inside the house.

In a daze, I followed the sound to our bedroom, to the second drawer in the dresser by the bed. Inside the drawer was George’s phone, a charger, and a letter. A letter from me to myself.

*Dear Me (Alice),* 

*This will come as a shock, but this has happened before. George is gone. He was hit by a drunk driver on his way home from work. You will be sad, but remember you were sad before. Don’t tell the kids – they have enough to worry about. Tell them everything is fine. Visit Mom and read her Alice in Wonderland. Drive carefully.*

*Love,* 

*You (Alice)*";16190099240
The Wrath of the Lord;12;8;"She blasphemed against and to the Lord. In the solitude of prayer she uttered her sacrilege directly to God, she criticized Him harshly and plainly. She said God was weak, that God was powerless. A coward. 

She said no powerful God would allow children to suffer hunger, not if they were truly a loving God. 

She pointed at war. She pointed at pediatric cancers. She pointed at poverty, she pointed at the cruelty of His world.

She blamed Him.

She said that these things meant that God was either evil or weak or non existent. 

But she chose to believe that God existed and that God was not evil, so that meant God was simply weak. Powerless. She said if she was wrong then He could go ahead and smite her to prove it. 

And the Lord heard these accusations and taunts. And He fixated and ruminated- God could not let it go. His heart brimmed with rage. His thoughts were a chaos of frustrated indignance....

That a mere human would dare to criticize Him?! To make Him feel... so... attacked. God was embarrassed- and He wanted revenge. He felt so overwhelmed He wanted her to feel the same. 

So he sent his Angel to her.

And the Angel of the Lord dipped his fingers into her soul and stirred up a buzzing.so she could feel what He felt. 

As the chaos of the universe grew loud within her, her own thoughts were muffled, then scattered, and she finally lost herself in the storm.

She felt her sanity fraying. Her sense of self was fracturing. And she felt powerless to stop it. And she was afraid. Ashamed.

And in the swirling madness of cosmic power, the Lord saw her pain and heard her confused cries and said it was good.";16190623500
Dante's Billboard;22;1;"During the day, the highway and the flat, arid land surrounding it reach out to a singular, unidentifiable point on the horizon.  At night, that point becomes obscured by the haze of darkness and seems more like a curtain a scant few hundred meters ahead. Since it travels at the same rate of speed I do, it can best be described as unreachable. I often wonder what theatrics lie beyond such things. What happens when you touch the untouchable, or reach the unreachable?

Shaking myself awake, I reached for my coffee and turned the song “Lose Yourself” up. I giggled a little as I grabbed my M&Ms from the seat and munched a handful. I felt like I’d been on this road an eternity.  I’d experienced this road dozens, if not hundreds, of times and that’s why the billboard caught me off guard. 

As I approached, an image on the sign became clearer and I swallowed hard at what I was looking at. I blinked rapidly trying to clear my drowsy eyes. 

*Surely, my imagination is getting the best of me.*

I slowed the car down to stop before it. There, in full, horrid detail, was me in an impossible pose. My face was pressed, flattened and long. I’d never seen my brains before and they looked like a chewed up old piece of bloody bubblegum.  My eyes were displaced like someone had created a living Picasso and stared at me like one of those pictures that always follows you. Each of my limbs were at unnatural angles and there were cracked, exposed bones everywhere. I puked up the coffee/M&M mixture.

With a swollen head, I got back in my car and got the fuck out of there.

I kept looking back in the rearview and watched the distance grow between me and that sign. As I refocused, a new billboard appeared on the horizon. This time I did not stop, but saw a new crushed image of myself. My own eyes gazed at me and I stepped on the gas.

The faster I went, the more frequently the billboards appeared. Each one fresh and different and depicting me contorted as if I’d been stepped on by a boot. Each one making direct eye contact with me.

Suddenly, that curtain of darkness rushed at me. In that moment, a blinding flash, a crash and extreme pain erupted out of nothing.

When I came to, I could neither move, nor breathe. All I felt was pain. Above the highway, I saw my car approach and stop. I tried to scream at myself to turn around. I watched myself hurl, then speed out of sight……but only momentarily.

As my car approached each new billboard, I was ripped from one pose and flattened into a new, more painful one. I kept trying to give warning looks to myself, but nothing worked. Finally, my car passed me into the curtain beyond.";16190470900
The Beast;6;4;"You’re walking through the woods and hear the sound of a twig snapping underneath somebody’s foot behind, all the sudden you see a glowing fog roll in and see one person appear outta nowhere and bolts out attacking you and pulls you into the dark foggy forest.

They heard a voice off in the distance saying “GET OUT OF HERE IT’S NOT SAFE!” A chill goes down their spines, one of the boy’s speak up and say “Hey, I don’t think we’re supposed to be here, maybe we should turn back and sit at home.” The leader of the group responds “Exx,don’t be worried maybe they are talking to a different person...” another boy said in a loud whisper “Steady, how do you think they were talking to a different person, tell me who in their right mind would be in the middle of the woods at midnight wandering around and talking?” Steady questions himself. “Raid, you never know there might be a hunter camping out here waiting for sunrise to hunt some dear, it is close to deer season after all.” 


Then they all hear a whooshing sound behind them to turn around and see nothing, the temperature drops. A boy says “Why did it go from 56 degrees to what feels like 20 degrees?” Steady bounces back in a very jocular tone “OoOh mayBe it’s A ghOst.” 


They then hear a whooshing sound again and one of the boys' screams fades off in the dark foggy forest. They all scream in unison, it begins happening more and more. Steady,Exx, and Raid are standing in the forest, their friends gone, Raid speaks up “ I think I’m on the same boat as Exx now I think we should get out of he-“ Steady and Exx watch their friend get pulled into the darkness and fog. They start running back to their house. 

Steady looks back and sees what sweeps Exx away. A hairy human-like figure that runs faster than a bullet that appeared to have nothing on. Steady is the only one who made it out alive. 


To this day some people say when you go out into those woods between 11:45 and 1:00 fog rolls in and you can see six figures stand in a glowing white fog and hear a whoosh then never to be seen again. I’m glad to tell you all this story and to be alive but, I feel like The Beast is always behind me watching me, waiting to pull me into those woods and be gone forever";16190693610

Eat;1841;198;"My eyes are itching, and my novelty birthday hat is strapped on too tight. It’s an infantile fantasy theme this year, and I loathe it with every fiber of my being. I’m fifteen years old, mom. I don’t fucking care about wizards and unicorns and fucking sparkle faeries anymore.

Before me looms the birthday cake, and I swallow deeply.

“Make a wish, pumpkin,” my mom’s shrill voice calls from across the table.

I wish you’d fucking die. I wish I was never born. I wish someone would strangle me in my sleep.

I blow out the candles, a single tear rolling down my chin.

Mom cheers excitedly, a crazed expression on her wrinkled face. “What did you wish for?”

*Death*, I think. “Um, some new clothes and shoes,” I murmur.

“Yes, that’s a good wish,” mom says, readying the knife. “Really good wish.”

She stares at me silently with puffy red eyes, shaking her head in disappointment. That’s my mom, through and through. An Avatar of Disappointment. Snide remarks and veiled insults incarnate. I am never to feel good about myself, remains her undying creed. I’m not pretty, not smart, not worthy of any attention whatsoever.

Unless it’s my birthday.

“It’s a big old cake, isn’t it?” she grins, puffing on her menthol cigarette disgustingly, spittle dripping all over her garish outfit. “Been quite a year.”

“I’m sorry mom. I’ll do better, promise” I whisper. “Please, can I be excused?”

“Oh no. No no no. You have to try the cake. You have to finish it all.”

The knife cuts through it in slow, methodical slices, and I can feel her spiteful gaze on me like sharp pins in my flesh.

“Forty-four pounds. That’s twenty kilos, Caitlyn. Incidentally also the average weight of a six year old child.”

“Uh, I’ll be better,” I whimper pathetically. “Please.”

“I don’t think you *can*, darling,” she says coldly, dropping an oozing slice on my plate. “But we shall see. Got a whole year to improve now, don’t we?”

I nod weakly, desperately trying to wipe away the tears. But I can’t. I can’t move my hands.

“Now eat,” she says. “Dig into the cake like the disgusting animal you are.”

I wince painfully, the suction tubes inserted in my abdomen rubbing against the pus-filled wounds; flood waves of pain washing over me if I move so much as an inch. But I can handle the pain. That’s not my punishment. No, the punishment is the cake. Every last drop of my own excess fat somehow pumped into that abomination.

I’ve gained forty-four pounds too much this year, according to my mom. That’s twenty kilos. Or a six year old child.

And now I have to slurp it all up again.

My mom stands behind me now, the menthol stench of her sweaty body bombarding my nostrils relentlessly. Sinewy hands around my neck in a firm grip, she forces my face ever closer to the horrid gloop of chunky fat.

“Puh-please,” I murmur.

“Eat.”";16189557360
Focus;10;0;"I glance down the makeshift bandage around my hand.

“This is why you don’t rush.”

I hear the voice of my mother.

“You can never rush perfection.”

The bandage drips blood on my knee. I stare at the crimson drop as it falls onto my denim jeans. It remains there for a split second, the surface tension holding it in a perfect unbroken drop, before it seeps and stains my pants. The worn and torn jeans seems to frame that spot beautifully.

A sound of a horn snaps my attention back to the road. 

I turn the wheel to stay in my lane.

I’m in such a rush.

But I should be?

I have to be. 

I’m running away aren’t I?

I am.

I need to be fast.

“You need to focus.”

The headlights coming are bright, my wipers are on full, desperately trying to push the rain from my windshield and keep me from being blind to the road. I see the tail lights in the distance. They are a pair of both round and wide rectangles with a small central one located just above the the trunk. They seem faded, one might need to be replaced soon. The car looks aged as well, maybe it’s silver it’s tough to make out. There is a sticker on the bumper. I do not manage to read it before I strike the car at full speed.

I stumble from the wreck. 

The rain soaks me through.

I need to get out of this weather.

I’m cold.

“You never dress warm enough.”

Is my arm broken?

I step over the curb.

The mud is going to ruin my shoes.

The trees are beautiful this time of year.

I walk through them and sit below one.

From the edge of the woods I see a brilliant light show and a cacophony of sounds. People yelling, tires screech, headlights and taillights in all directions and shapes. Spinning red and blue lights arrive after what only must have been minutes. The siren is wonderful. It cuts through all other noises like a knife. It’s pitch, it’s highs and lows punctuate with such power.  It demands respect.

I am be demanded to my knees.

An officer? 

I hear fragments of words.

The waters gotten in my ears.

Murderer?

Shoot me if I don’t comply?

I see the glint of the badge on his uniform.

I lean forward as he cuffs me.

“How could you? How could you kill those people!?” 

Her voice is back.

He seems strong.

A crowd gathered just for me?

I finally will get out of this rain.

Will they wash the blood out of my pants?

Will they find what was in my trunk?";16190558900
Happy;116;7;"This morning was great. 


I woke up next to the woman of my dreams. Beautiful, intelligent, funny. We shared the same quick wit and sarcastic humour and I fell for her instantly.


We had only met the night before, both of us feeling the spark and she happily came home with me. We spent the entire night talking, laughing and getting high. 


I decided to take the short five mintute walk to the coffee shop and bring her back a cappuccino. On my way, I stopped by the local shop and picked up a scratch-card. I instantly scratched it at the counter;


*50,000...50,000...50,000*


My jaw dropped.


The shop attendant explained how to claim my prize and I happily went on my way. The biggest smile was plastered across my face. I was practically skipping down the road.


There's an alleyway entrance just before the coffee shop in which a man's voice, who somehow knew my name, beconed me to enter. There was something about his voice. I couldn't fathom it out. It simply pulled me in.


""You have one wish,"" his voice was very deep and strange. It was scary, yet, some how trustworthy and inticing at the same time. ""But,"" he continued, ""be careful with your words."" 


And that was all he said. 


He just stood there in his hooded cloak, glaring at me. His liquid-gold eyes and slow breathing were equally soothing, as they were terrifying.


Is he truly something magical and actually granting me a wish?...


With this fantastic day I was already having and the intensity of his whole being, I chose to believed him and took a few minutes to think about it.


He said to be careful with my words, probably because there'll be bad implications if I didn't word it correctly, as with all wishes, I suppose.


*I know...I Got it*...


""I wish to be as happy every day, as I am today.""


He bowed his head towards me. The hood of his cloak completely  engulfed the rest of his face and all I could still see, were them golden, flaming eyes. Then, that's when I felt the pain. He'd stabbed me with his extra-long, razor-sharp fingers. He dug in deep and directly into my upper-stomach.


He then dragged me down the alleyway into nothing but bugs, dirt, and more bugs. It was a place no human comes to visit and lives to tell the tale. And this is where he unhinged and dumped me...Food for the bugs.


He sat with me until the end. Glaring into my soul. And saying absolutely nothing.


It takes between 24-and-48 hours for a person to die from a stab wound to the upper-abdomen, but because of the bugs eating away at my decaying body, sepsis set in much faster, and I died at hour 15.


Before my world finally turned black, I heard his inticing voice once more;


""You're wish is granted.""

Exchange;39;3;"At 11am this morning, I had the pleasure of meeting a younger couple on the bus. I overheard them speaking of money issues so I decided to help out. They urged me to take the check back but I refused. 10,000$ is alot of money but today was their lucky day. 

Around 2pm I overheard about the construction workers death on the radio. The hitchhiker was hesitant to get into my car for that reason but I was able to convince him. We drove for 2 hours until we got to his requested location. Once there, I stepped out of the drivers seat and handed him the keys. He nearly cried tears of joy when I signed the title over to him for free. 

At 4pm police had reported on the news that another tragedy struck, a stabbing occurred at a train station. While thinking, a homeless woman approached me and asked for change. I did her one better. After pulling a few strings, a friend of mine in the restaurant business was able to give her a job that paid well. It felt amazing to do a good deed. 

7pm is when I decided I should make my way home. On the walk, a black lab barked at me rather viciously. Luckily the bone I bought earlier satisfied the chained animal. Across the street I spotted a missing cat poster. 

It was about 8pm when I finally made it to my house. My love sat listening to breaking news on the radio at our dinner table. The man speaking was rehashing the crimes that had taken place earlier. She smiled as I walked in.

""Did you have a good day?"" She asked curiously. 

""It was excellent! I made alot of people happy. From what I heard, sounds like you had a bad day?"" I responded wrily. 

""The worst. It was great!"" She beemed towards the radio. 

""Let's trade tomorrow.""";16190154170
Birdcage;32;3;"“I promised mom I’d try to die,” Mari said.

“Don’t be silly. We can’t die. How many knives to your heart and throat will it take before you understand that?” To demonstrate, Isaac punched his nose till it broke and swelled and he couldn’t breathe through it, then he took both hands and squeezed his neck and the veins on his neck showed like thick snakes pulsing. 

He didn’t breathe for a minute, then ten minutes, and thirty minutes later, he looked triumphantly at his little sister and let his hands fall.

“We can’t die, so don’t try, just realize we’re forever confined to this pigsty.” Isaac gestured to the floor of both their cages, all caked in shit and piss, and vomit, from smelling that shit and piss and vomit. They’re cages hadn’t been cleaned in a week.

“I can still try. Mom says that it’s the only way I’ll ever get out of this cage. This birdcage. I’ll die and become a ghost and these bars won’t hold me any longer. I’ll glide through them and fly away towards wherever I desire,” Mari said. She riled herself up a bit too much and jumped in the air, banging her head against the hard golden bars. 

“Mom will be disappointed because you’ll never die. And she’ll have to keep you locked up in here and you’ll wish you turned to rot and millenia will pass and you’ll still be here wishing you were dead like everyone else on this planet!”

“I’ll become a ghost yet brother! Like mother, like father! I’ll die and it’ll be you who bangs and clamors within his birdcage, meanwhile I’ll fly like a raven everywhere!” Mari shouted and she twisted within the confines of her cage.

She fidgeted and pumped her arms like a bird about to take flight. 

“Watch brother,” Mari said, then twisted her head clockwise with her hands. Then some more she twisted like she was steering the wheel of a car. Steering herself towards un-life.

She rotated her head three-hundred and sixty degrees, then another. “Look brother, I’m an owl,” she choked, because her vocal chords were strained. Then she twisted some more, and her head was facing a direction she knew not, because her orbital sockets unplugged and her eyes fell out, but she didn’t die. Her head just drooped. 

“Mari,” Isaac banged his fists against the cage, and the lock fell, and his door opened. He stepped out and looked at his sister trying to put her head back to it’s natural position, but she lost track of how many rotations it took.

He looked towards the window, and out at the city and the world full of ghosts. He leapt out the window, crashing, going nowhere in particular. 

And his sister Mari struggled in her cage, trying to put her lolling head upright, and she continued doing so until her parents flew back home, their wispy tails coiling.

They kept their little birdie caged up.";16190191170
Terms And Conditions;62;44;"Jimmy ran out of the liquor store, holding two twelve-packs of beer in his hands. He could hear the shopkeeper behind him, cursing up a blue storm. Jimmy dove through the open passenger door of his car, slid across the seat, and placed the beer behind him, all in one swift move. He gunned the engine and pulled away; the passenger door obediently slammed closed. Damn, he was smooth.

As he got to within two blocks of his apartment, suddenly he found himself surrounded by police cruisers. They jumped from their cars and advanced on him with batons. Jimmy smirked; he knew the drill. They opened his door and let him exit, showing he was unarmed, then in a flash, they handcuffed him.

""Hey! What's going on?"" Jimmy protested. ""You can't detain me for petty theft! You have to cite and release!""

The police started laughing among themselves. Jimmy's brow furrowed. ""What's so funny?""

One officer held up a picture to Jimmy. ""Is this you, from two days ago?"" It showed Jimmy driving back into town. ""Sure, what of it?""

""Don't you see the sign?"" Jimmy squinted. Below the ""Welcome To Skeeter"" sign was a new one; he hadn't noticed it before. In the picture, the writing was too small to read. Jimmy scowled. ""What of it?""

""Those are the new terms and conditions for living here. Stealing that beer was a violation. You've voluntarily given up your permission to live here, and will be expelled immediately.""

Jimmy was aghast. ""You can't do that! I have rights!"" Again, the police rolled with laughter. He was annoyed. ""What now?""

""You must be thinking of the *city* of Skeeter. This is the *corporation* of Skeeter. The local gated community association bought the city after it defaulted on its debt. The sign you passed explained it all.""

Jimmy steamed. ""You can't do this! I'll get a lawyer, and beat this rap!"" Again, uproarious laughter.

""Just by being here, you waived your right to a jury trial, and agreed to submit to binding arbitration. Of course, *we* hire the arbitrators, and they only meet *here*, and you're not *allowed* in here, so...""

Jimmy sputtered. ""This...this is *un-American*!""

""The government won't do *anything* about this. Skeeter incorporated as a city management firm *and* a social-media company. These sorts of terms and conditions are *extremely* common with online businesses. Nothing out of the ordinary at *all*.""

The officers continued to chuckle. Jimmy pouted, but could think of nothing. ""So what now?""

The officer grabbed him gently and led him to a squad car. ""Now, we escort you out of corporation limits.""

Once there, the officer uncuffed Jimmy and gave him a light shove. ""Don't come back.""

He knelt to look at the sign. The writing was too small to read without a magnifying glass. He wondered if that was legal. Sourly, he realized it was probably authorized by the terms and conditions.

Glumly, Jimmy began walking to the next town. He wondered if there was one.";16190026740
Be Like Dad app;46;2;"Our son Isaac loved screens; his eyes glued to a screen provided a nice distraction from reality. His Father, Cal, was an alcoholic and crossed the line one too many times. I was trapped and depended on Cal’s income to keep us afloat, but I tried my best to keep Isaac occupied in a fantasy world while Cal and I argued over petty things. When Isaac downloaded the Be Like Dad app, I was little taken aback. Cal never showed an interest in Isaac. He thrashed him daily for his overuse of technology. And I could see the disappointment in Isaac’s face; all he desired was some Fatherly attention, a role model. But Isaac thought if he could replicate his Father and show an interest in enjoying similar activities, that perhaps his Father would return the favor and get invested in his life.

The app asked Isaac to take a photo of his Dad partaking in an activity and then for Isaac to take a photo of himself doing the same thing. With each set of photos uploaded, Isaac would be one step closer to unlocking a reward. The reward was a mystery, but it was enough of an incentive for Isaac to jump on the opportunity immediately.

It started out innocently enough.  A photo snapped while Cal nailed some old deck boards back into place with a hammer. Moments later, Isaac took a selfie putting a nail into place. Cal was amused, as I watched a glimmer of a smile emerge. From there, Cal and Isaac’s relationship slowly blossomed. Whether it was washing dishes together or throwing the baseball around, the photo uploads continued, but Cal still had a dark side that came out when it was just me and him alone. 

One evening after he polished off a six-pack, he took out a belt and beat me in the bedroom. I caught Isaac hiding in the shadows just outside the room, watching the abuse unfold. Isaac snapped a photo while Cal lashed out and then rushed into the room, seizing the belt from Cal’s hand. Isaac proceeded to attack me as well while snapping a selfie. I sobbed uncontrollably as Cal grabbed our son and yelled at him for interfering with Mommy and Daddy time.

Later that night as Cal and I were sleeping, a horrific squealing noise woke me up, as blood splattered on my face. I froze when I saw Isaac bashing Cal’s skull in with a hammer. He didn’t let up until Cal’s face was nothing but a puddle of mushy bone and skin chunks.

“What have you done?” I screamed.

“Mommy, I won. The app said I don’t need a Dad anymore. I can be the man of the house.”

Isaac crawled into my arms for a hug. I grabbed a cigarette from the nightstand and lit one up. And the scary thing is, I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.";16189921170
The sleep over;5;1;"
I have been friends with Martin and carol for many years now and they are both married. I met them through work and they are the most introverted out of the group. They socialise but they also like their own space and silence. I never thought that they would ever be the ones to start wanting people to sleep over at their house and advertising that it would be fun. They started becoming like this when they had their first baby and this just made it even more strange that a married couple with a new born baby that lean towards introversy would advertise sleep overs to their friends at their own house.

I decided to accept thier invitation when I was driving down to their area for work purposes and instead of booking a hotel, I thought living with them for a month would be great. Their baby was a fussy one but I didn't mind it and when we were all a sleep, I had the spare room. Their baby started crying through out the night which woke me up and carol at the same time, but not Martin. Martin was a super deep sleeper and even with his baby crying he was still a sleep. Carol then begged me to help her with the baby and even asking me to get up and feed their baby so that she could have some rest.

I politely declined siting that I am not the husband and when the baby started crying again carol become more annoyed with me, demanding that because I am awake that I might as well help her with the crying baby, but I politely told her that she should wake up her husband. When I said that she became angry and told me to come into her room where her deep sleeping husband was peacefully a sleep. She started stabbing him, chopping off his fingers and throwing water at his face but he was still a sleep.

""Look do you see! even after I have stabbed him and chopped off his fingers he is still a sleep. Ever since the baby was born I have been doing the night baby rounds every night and because my husband is a super deep sleeper he doesn't hear anything. That's why we advertised the sleep overs so that someone could kind of help me do the baby night rounds"" she admitted to me shamefully

I fearfully told her ""look I'm not the husband......"" And when I said that she became enraged and started throwing acid at her peacefully sleeping husband to prove to me again at how deep her husband sleeps. I just got out and got a hotel.";16190368120
The Boy Who Couldn't Laugh;222;14;"“Why are you such a dour boy?” Micah asked Felix. “You never smile.” 

Felix showed his teeth. “See? I can smile. And don’t call me a boy, papa, I’m a grown man.” 

“Pshaw,” said Micah. “You’re a humorless boy and you make me tired. Please ask your sisters to come visit. They are much brighter and warmer than you.” 

Felix found Elyay practicing the cello in the atrium. Her hands moved quickly up and down the instrument’s neck, her head tilted so that the small hearing aid shone like a falling star over the ocean. Danielle was sitting on a rug, listening to her sister play. 

“Father would like for you two to-” Felix’s words were cut off by the roar of a lion and the crack of a tamer’s whip. Both sounds had emerged from his throat unprompted. 

“Are you well, Felix?” Elyay asked. 

Danielle wrinkled her nose. “You smell like cotton candy and rain, Felix.” 

“I’m not so well,” Felix said, lying down. “I will rest.” 

“Sleep then, little brother,” said Elyay. “And try to dream undepressing dreams. Dour, dour boy.”

Felix didn’t hear his sister. He was already asleep. After a full night of refreshing sleep, Felix woke up shrieking. Over the evening, his body had begun to change. His limbs stretched twice, then thrice as far as they should, joints popping like New Year’s champagne. Felix’s ribcage was poking through his shirt, little boney icebergs peeking from a sea of blood and fabric. The smell of cotton candy was overwhelming. 

“What is the matter, son?” Micah asked. 

Felix tried to reply but instead of words, the bells and clangor of a busy arcade poured from his mouth. He wept neon tears. Elyay recommenced playing her cello. For the next week, Felix continued to change. His body split until he spread out across the atrium floor like a fleshy puddle. Felix’s spine elongated and curved, looping several times. Tiny people began to emerge from the ruin of Felix. Lights were strung up between exposed points of bone. Felix’s pelvis was carved into a merry-go-round, his jaw expanded into a Ferris wheel while his twisted spine became the home of an old fashion roller coaster. 

Through it all, he kept trying to speak. But only joyful sounds emerged. 

One day, Felix was gone. Only a miniature, blood-stained amusement park remained. 

“Does that one look like Felix?” Danielle asked, pointing at one of the minuscule people enjoying the rides. 

“The frown is there,” said Micah, “but he is too small to tell.” 

“I think the little man looks happy,” Elyay said. 

“Who can tell, these days,” Micah replied, scooping down to start gathering tiny, screaming figures. 

One by one the guests were gathered. Then the rides. What remained of Felix was put into a large box and displayed in the yard. Gawkers were charged a nickel apiece to come and watch the world’s smallest amusement park whirl and ramble.";16189564560
Graphite Hill;36;2;"Jenkins couldn't find any historical deeds regarding Graphite Hill. There were no records of its planning approval. No local workman could recall working on it. Nor could he trace anybody ever having lived there. He only learned it's real name when an old drunk blurted it out.

This mysterious place lay on the South Kent coast. A crooked line of nine terraced houses tucked in between the white cliffs. He had spotted it while sailing.

To reach the houses he had to navigate through troubled waters, dense with seaweed.

Upon landing, he discovered that the noise of the sea was muted; a peculiar acoustic sensation existed here. He was also astonished by how pristine everything looked. The houses were immaculate, no smashed windows, rust or faded paintwork. Someone must be tending to them, Jenkins thought.

Yet how could this place exist? The locals had snorted ignorantly when asked about the history of Graphite Hill. Jenkins was new to the area and easily dismissed by the villagers.

He decided to investigate the first house: number 'Three.' One and Two were no longer here. He knocked on the door. There was no reply. Instead, the door opened inwards. Jenkins stood back unnerved.

Entering, he surveyed the living room. He was thankful he had brought a lantern with him as it was relatively dark inside. He saw furniture: a sofa and several cabinets. Displayed inside stood two small wooden figures carved from driftwood.

Jenkins decided to investigate. Nothing in the house appeared out of the ordinary. It was tidy and it appeared to have been recently inhabited. It was perplexing. Fearing he was intruding, he decided to leave.

As Jenkins made his way downstairs he sensed something was wrong. The carpet in the hallway had a different pattern. Fleur-de-Lys was now Royal Garden. He was no coward but fearfully exited the house. When he turned to look, the number on the door read 'Seven.' Number Three was further down the path.

For the rest of the day, he entered each house while exiting from another. What architectural game was this? How could this be? He wasn't afraid though. There was no feeling of danger.

The sun was receding so Jenkins made to leave. When he reached the shore he noticed his boat had loosened and was now clogged amongst the seaweed.

He had little choice but to stay the night and try to retrieve his boat in the morning. He bedded in Number Three. The encroaching darkness unsettled him so he lit the fireplace. He swore he heard children giggling in the night.

When Jenkins awoke his nerves were alight. He rushed outside and down to the shoreline. Miraculously, his boat had washed ashore. He thanked God.

As he rowed away, Jenkins saw the doors of every house open, each number screaming in a different child's voice, pleading for him to come back and play.

And as frantically as he rowed, he could feel the tide forcing him back to shore.";16189843760

I bike everywhere now. Kid’s parents took me for everything I had, and I sold my car to fight ‘em. I lost though. Whaddya know? Parents-of-the-Year let their kid run wild, but by the letter of the law, I was the guy speedin’ through suburbia murderin’ children. 

I hate biking home in the dark. Hate it. I kick my stand up. There’s a freezing headwind as I make my way into the suburbs. On the road, 'course. No bike path out here. 

I look over my shoulder. 

I wait for it to start. 

I’m not crazy.

But when you’re out on the roads at night—I mean without a car, right? You… hear things, yeah? Cars comin’ up behind you, dogs barkin’, other bikes around, even when you know that’s fuckin’ bull. 

See, when I’m out late, in between all the other sounds my head makes up, I hear a little ring. A little fuckin’ *ring, ring*. I hear that stupid bell. 

*Ring, ring.* 

There it is. My heart stops. “It’s in your head, mate,” I growledl to myself, eyes fixed on the road. 

*Ring, ring.* 

My hands were shaking bad now—from the cold. Yeah. The cold. I slowed down and dismounted. Not far out from home. 

 *Ring, ring.* 

*Ring, ring.* 

*Ring, ring.* 

“Incessant little shit.” I mumbled. 

*Ring, ring.* 

I stopped dead in the middle of the road, struck with a thought. A stupid thought. A real crackpot idea. Reaching down to my own bell, I rang it. *‘Ring, ring.’*

*Ring, ring. Ring, ring.* 

“Oh, you like that, huh?” I asked. I rang my bell again. *‘Ring, ring.’*

*Ring, ring.*

The ringing was *movin*’. Movin’ fast. It passed me right by until it was out front leading the way. I saddled my bike and pushed off, following it down the road like a fuckin’ lunatic. 

*Ring, ring.* 

Faster. It was goin’ faster now. Fuck, I was pedalling like a mad-man just to keep pace. One hand steering my bike, the other on my bell, ringing the absolute shit outta it. 

*Ring, ring.*

I guess I should’ve seen it comin’. I hared ‘round a bend—rocketed outta the dark onto a road— and I rung my bell*. ‘Ring, ring.'* 

At that time of night, who even stops at stop signs? I mean really.";16189573960
Maybe You've seen Mrs Typical;923;30;"Maybe you've seen Mrs Typical.


But I guess you wouldn't remember. I am envious.


Your eyes might have flickered across her face. But nobody really notices.


She's the one who sits at the back of the class, and never raises her hand.


In a cinema audience. In the angry queue for an early morning latte. In the crowded elevator.


She's everywhere, and nowhere. Don't try to picture her; you can't. 


She dresses plainly for every occasion, even a wedding. She's never the first to arrive, or the last one to leave. 


Her hair is blandly fashionable. She wears neither a smile nor a frown.


Nobody really knows who she is. You'll never know any more about her than I.


I know she exists. And that's precisely the cause of the trouble I find myself in.


I noticed her. That's all I did.


In a group photo of an office Christmas party, I saw her. I almost ignored her.


Almost.


How I wish I could go back to that moment. To change everything.


I looked again. Saw her, at the back. I asked around the office; someone must recognize her? But no.


Nobody knew. Nobody cared.


I saw her again, on another photograph. Behind me on a busy beach, when I was five. 


And there she was, at my high school graduation. Standing a little to my right. Staring passively ahead. Staring right by. Looking at nothing.


I searched through every photo I could find. And saw her, over and over. Always in a crowd. Strangely ageless. Inhuman.


I tried to excite interest from family and friends, but they barely bothered to look. Told me my eyes were tired. Or that I've too much on my mind.


I've much on my mind now, alright. 


I began to see her in the flesh. If she's made of flesh. I somehow doubt it.


She was at a basketball game, not watching the action. And crossing a busy street, but not watching traffic.


She was watching me.


It's amazing how ordinary she seems. Like a crazy amalgamation of everyone on earth.


Though she spoke no words, I know that I have transgressed. Trespassed upon her domain.


She doesn't even try to hide from me anymore. Or perhaps she never hid. Perhaps she never had to. Perhaps people just don't notice her. Until I did.


Perhaps she likes to watch, but to not be noticed.


Perhaps she observes, oversees. Enjoys. 


Certainly she was smiling slightly, when I glimpsed her through my kitchen window. Glimpsed her, from the outside.


And again, I caught her grinning a little, on my TV screen. Just a flicker, so fleeting, that I was unsure whether she'd appeared in the TV show I'd been watching, or in the screen's reflection, standing in the shadows behind me.


There could be no such blessed ambiguity when I saw her in my bathroom mirror tonight, right before I switched off the light.";16189154200

Obviously, I know its me but at the same time it isn't. Has it ever really been me? Every time I look at myself in the mirror it's beginning to look more and more like a corpse, like I'm slowly rotting away. Recently its gotten worse, my reflections beginning fall apart. The skins rotting and falling off, the hair is almost gone. Some people say that your reflection is your soul, so what's happening to mine? Does it mean I'm going to die soon? I can't talk to anyone about this because they'll think I'm crazy. what would I even say?

Crystal;44;0;"Spontaneous crystallisation, they called it. Started back in January with a fella in Taiwan, the whole left side of his body just went and turned to quartz.

Imagine that! Just going about your day happy as can be, then boom, you’re a big shiny rock!

His heart froze instantly of course. So he didn’t have long to panic about the whole thing.

Caught on like a fad after that. People all over the world having bits of them freeze solid for no good reason. A few folks every day, no connection between them.

I don’t have to tell you how panicked everyone got! Sure, as many just had a hand or their feet turn, but we all saw the pictures of the ones who had something essential crystallise.

We’d all seen their frozen, horrified expressions.

There was a feeling in the air from all that worry. It was like the wake after funeral; everyone smiling and eating the spread, while avoiding thinking or talking about the elephant in the room.

But life went on. It was rare enough that we couldn’t shut down everything. Even when it sped up, ten folk a day, twenty.

I got pretty lucky. One of my legs went crystal in March. There was a special government pension, so I got to sit in my lounge chair and polish my big, sparkly foot.

Left me a lot of time to sit and watch the news. Time to watch things get worse.

The Prime Minister, in the middle of speech, crystallised. I don’t even remember what the speech was about, but I remember watching him tumble of the stage and shatter. By the nightly broadcast the Vice Prime Minister was in charge. They talked about it like it was natural as anything, though at this point I suppose it was.

A pilot froze in the middle of landing his plane, slammed it into the airport. A stock of jet fuel caught fire. They stopped air travel after that.

I think that’s when everything started to slow down. Fewer people showed up to work each day, fewer people even dared venture out of their house.

I haven’t heard anyone outside for a few days now.

I’m recording all this because I hope someone finds it. I hope one day someone comes across me while they’re rebuilding society. Call it the last hope of a lonely man.

I don’t know if there’s anyone else still alive. The TV has been dead for a while, and no one even bothered to put on the emergency broadcast.

Maybe someone tried. Maybe they froze at the last moment. I almost like to think so.

It’d be such a perfect image of this whole damn thing, frozen in motion. Crystallised, even.";16189646370
A Girl in the Window;35;4;"I barely recognize her anymore. 

It wasn’t long ago that I could give her the biggest smile and wave and she would smile and wave back beaming just as bright.

Now she looks pale. I see dark rings under her blood shot eyes. Her hair is unkept and it looks like she has been wearing the same dress for a while.

I’m worried about her.

I am no doctor, but she looks malnourished and sleep deprived.  

Every day I see her and I don’t know what to do.

Do I try to reach out to her? 

Do I try to see what’s wrong?

But I’m so scared.

I’m afraid she might have problems like mine. I can’t even handle my own problems right now so how could I hope to help with hers?

So every day I just see her and she sees me. We just exist and my worry grows.

What if she can’t handle it anymore?

What if she does something drastic?

What if I could have helped?

I get so lost in these questions that time just passes me and I find myself just seeing her again without lifting a finger. 

And she just continues to appear more ghastly. 

She would’ve sought help if she wanted it right?

I try to reason weak excuses in my mind to relieve my guilt but it always comes back and feels like a crushing weight when I see her.

And I realize that maybe I’m the only one she sees. 

Maybe she has lost someone too.

Maybe she has been feeling the same stress as me and just wants someone to reach out to her and show her a bit of comfort in hard times. 

Maybe she just wants a bit of light.

But maybe I’m wrong. 

Maybe she wants to be alone.

Maybe she thinks she can handle her problems.

Maybe I’ll see her again tomorrow, in the mirror above my sink.

Maybe I’ll be better tomorrow.";16189568260
Jonathan Unbound;19;0;" 

Professor Sivel’s hands danced around each other as she recited the words of the spell. Their motion was fluid and natural, hiding the years of practice that it took to reach such a proficient level of spell-casting.

I repeated after her, nailing the incantation itself. I was excellent at the vocal aspect of spell-casting, but the intricate hand movements, which were the important part of the process, often gave me trouble.

I glanced around at the rest of the students in the classroom, reminding myself that I wasn’t alone in this regard. We were all trying to repeat after Sivel and cast the spell of water-filling that she had just demonstrated, but most of the cups in front of us were still dry. The ancient vowels in the words of the spell were easy for us by now as fourth years, but the hand motions were still illusive.

“No Shane, it’s like \*this\*,” Sivel said to a student in the front of the classroom, showing him again.

“My damn bolts get caught on each other though!” Shane exclaimed, frustrated.

“Language!” Sivel scolded. “Well then, I guess you’ll have to wait till you get them removed before casting a simple water spell.”

The class laughed. Bolts were enchanted hunks of metal that were drilled into all magic students’ hands until they came of age. They protruded out of the hand in an obvious way, and prohibited one from casting any spell that hurt another living being.

At fourteen, Shane still had six years to go before he got his bolts removed. The retort from Sivel that Shane would be unable to perform an amateur spell for that long was deeply comical to the rest of us.

“Very funny,” Shane scowled.

Suddenly, a scream rang out from the back of the room.

I turned to find an older student standing in the doorway. She was covered in blood.

“It’s....Jonathan….” the student managed to get out before collapsing.

The head of a kid in front of me exploded, soaking me in blood. Through the spot where it had been a moment ago, I could see Jonathan walking into the room. He was grinning.

“How??” Professor Sivel bellowed out. “Your bolts are still in! You can’t make the motions for those spells!”

Jonathan was gifted, everybody knew that. But he still had his bolts for three more years. Conventional wisdom held that there was no way Jonathan could commit any violence, no matter how talented he was.

And then I saw it. Jonathan’s bolts were still in his hands, alright.

It was the hands themselves.

Those hung on a chain from his neck, bouncing against his chest while he walked. At the end of his arms were bloody stumps.

“But…handless magic…” Sivel began. “That’s imposs-“

She was interrupted by her face starting to turn itself inside out from the mouth.

Jonathan began murdering his way around the room, his magic refusing to bow to the natural laws that we had been taught were unbreakable.";16189605370

I'll be home for dinner...;1102;27;"“Text message from…Jessica. Would you like me to read it?” the vehicle navigation system inquires, as  Mr. Alex Carter slams on his brakes to avoid rear-ending a late-model Cadillac Escalade.

A message from Jessica…surely not his late wife, Jessica; the very same Jessica who Alex's…associate…assured was, “sleeping with the fishes” at the bottom of the Hudson River, over five months ago? Would he like to read the message? Not really…

Hands trembling and heart thumping, Alex manages a shaky, “Yes.”

“I'll be home for dinner…heart emoji,” the navigation system drones.

*I'll be home for dinner.* It was the last text message he had received from her; the last words she had ever communicated to him. She had NOT made it home that night, having been intercepted by a faceless goon on her drive home. The less he knew about it, the better.

As traffic started moving again, Alex considered the reasons he may have gotten the message, and he suddenly remembered a similar message from his friend, Jim, just last week. He'd just left home and was headed for work, when the system told him he had a text message from Jim: “Ok…hand medium skin-tone.” It had been a thumbs-up emoji Jim had sent the previous night; his navigation system had randomly decided to advise him of the message many hours after it had been sent. This had to be the same thing, although it was a morbid and unnerving coincidence, Alex told himself. It had to be the same thing…right? 

Still, he just couldn't shake the idea from his head of his dead, bloated, and dripping wife joining him and his new lady, Kayla, for dinner that night.

*I'll be home for dinner…*

Alex made a beeline for the wet-bar when he arrived home that evening. He poured himself a shot of something to calm his nerves, before greeting the voluptuous Kayla with a hug and kiss.

“What's for dinner?” he asked, although he could already smell it. Tacos. Can't go wrong with tacos.

*Text message from…Jessica…*

It wasn't long before the two were seated at the dining room table, an array of tacos and fixings before them.

“Oops, I forgot the sour cream,” Kayla giggles, “let me go grab that.”

*I'll be home for dinner…*

There's a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen and a loud thud. Then, as Alex sits staring at the kitchen door, he hears footsteps approach over the tile floor: SLAP…SLAP…SLAP. They were decidedly wet footsteps…

*I'll be home for dinner...*

Neurosurgery;427;14;"*32, female, prior history of chronic migraine and somnolence. Arrived at the hospital displaying signs of dense left-sided hemiplegia and altered mentation.*

*MRI scan showed vasogenic edema (accumulation of fluids from disruption of the blood-brain barrier) caused by a tumor in the lateral segment of the precentral gyrus.*

**Step 1:** preparations for surgery.

She's here at the operating room now. We positioned her to lie on her side for minimal brain shifting. I run one last equipment check in my mind as the other surgeons try to localize the tumor in her brain.

**Step 2:** make an incision along the scalp.

My scalpel slides down the flesh with minimal resistance. Muscle and skin were smoothly pulled back and held securely in place. The yellowish tint of the skull is exposed beneath.

**Step 3:** craniotomy.

The drill picks up bone dust, it is washed away along with slick, slimy fluids and faint red traces of blood. I carefully drill along the circle, feeling the bone plates vibrate beneath my fingers.

**Step 4:** expose the brain.

I lift up the bone plate and make small, sharp cuts across the dura - a tough, fibrous membrane that envelopes the brain. The soft, gel-like throbbing mass of fat and tissue is exposed beneath. My colleagues pull back the dura with tack-up sutures so I could work better.

**Step 5:** remove the tumor.

My brows furrow in intense concentration as I cut around the blood vessels intertwining the brain. I feel the sweat on my forehead drying immediately in the cold air. I slowly prod around the gelatinous mass and try to gain entry to where the tumor is. Shiny crimson blood oozes from the cuts. My colleagues work to suction it away before it interferes with my surgery.

**Step 6:**

*...What?*

In that dark, dense pulsating mass of fat tissues and nerve endings, I see it gazing back at me.

It almost blends into the blood and mush around it.

It sees my petrified face, my quivering lips mouthing a silent scream.

It *smiles* with a thousand eyes before burrowing deeper into the brain, disappearing among the arteries and wrinkles.

The beeping from the CUSA machine snaps me back to reality.

My colleagues stare at the dark, endless hole in the patient's brain. All of their faces deathly pale with terror.

Nobody utters a word.

**Step 7:** clean up.

I ease the hydrogen peroxide-soaked cotton ball down the hole to kill off the neoplastic cells, knowing full well it won't do much at this point. I then remove it and apply hemostatic agents to the brain, sew up the dura, tack on the replacement dura, and refit the skull plate with titanium micro-plates. I close up the scalp. Then I collapse in a chair and let my colleagues take over.

**Step 8:** go home.

the kind we created;240;23;"It’s November 13, and the snow won’t stop falling. The kids are on a school trip to Williamsburg. Dave is at work at some stupid thing in Boston. I run over to the next house over where the neighbor is pulling up his floorboards. I signal for him to follow me. I scream for him to follow me, but I can’t hear it. We go down the stairs and through the basement, walking past a smattering of colorful toys that never got picked up. I pull open the heavy door. It is nearly two feet thick and leads into a bunker below. Then I shove the door shut by pushing all of my weight into it, running down the rest of the stairs. The sounds of chaos and screaming and air are gone; The silence is deafening. My ears adjust.

For a moment neither of us spoke.

“Where is-” he paused for a second “you have a family. You know if they’re ok?”

“They’re out of this blast range” I said “there is a radio if you want to find out where the others are.'' The taste in my mouth was sickly. I knew I should check myself but I couldn’t bring myself to. It’s not like it would change anything. I sat down on the ground. It was concrete. The rough texture dug into my hands. There wasn’t much in the bunker, but there was more than enough. It was about a 10 foot by 10 foot room, stuffed with food, water, blankets, and anything else you might need to survive a month or two. The room came with the house, back from the cold war. Once you have a shelter you might as well spend a few hundred keeping it stocked. I figured it would be useful for hurricanes and the like.

He looked over the radio, before pausing for a second. He sat down on the couch folding his hands and paying special attention to his thumbs.

“I can’t blame them, you know.” He said somberly. “We nuked them first. What were they supposed to do?”

“It was an error” I said blankly. It felt hollow just saying it. It was an error that killed millions. The newswomen cried during the broadcast. She kept her voice the same, but tears were ruining her makeup. I switched from sitting to lying down.

The nuke fell. I heard deep rumbles, the kind that shakes your bones, at decibels that prevent hearing anything else. I didn’t know if the concrete would hold. I try to picture all of the people that were going to die. The millions of them. Hold them in my head as if that would save them. I couldn't. The gates of hell and heaven would be overrun with refugees. Eventually, it stopped and we existed in silence again.

“What kind of world do you think is going to be left of there?” He asked after an unknown amount of time.

""I did!"" He pulls a scrap from his pocket and frowns. ""Wait, it's smudged…""

""You idiot! We now only have ten minutes to get out of here!"" I slap the scrap out of his hand and toss the card. ""Screw the clues. We're gonna run until we get out.""

""Babe, it's a game. They aren't really going to kill us if we lose.""

I point to the corpse. ""You think that's a prop?"" 

""It's probably a donated body.""

The corpse crumbles to dust, and Del and I trip over each other as we run away, ominous laughter thundering behind us.

""I wish I never let you convince me to do this!""

""We'll make it!"" Dell pants. ""And we'll be the first to ever win!""

""I don't care about winning! I want to live!""

With no idea where to go, I turn left and Del follows, both of us dashing through a dim hall caked with blood and bile. My eyes water against the acrid odor and I dry-heave, pulling my shirt over my nose.

Claws rake through my hair and I scream and duck, crashing through a rotting door and falling inside a room. I get up, only to scream again at the writhing pile of dismembered arms.

Del rushes in after me and gawks. ""Those gotta be animatronics...""

The mutilated limbs point towards a curtain, and Del manages a tight chuckle.

""See? All part of the game!""

He sidesteps the arms and pulls the cloth. It disintegrates in his hands to reveal a dark doorway, and we hold our breaths and peek through.

Sweat-soaked, I shudder at an icy draft. Our names are the first thing I see, carved into the stone wall of a dungeon, and a chill grips my core when I notice the gallows, a hunched shadow adjusting their nooses.

Spurred by concentrated fear, I run back into the hall and turn left, too blinded by panic to notice the yawning pit until the last second.

My arms flail as I teeter on the edge, and I gasp as Del crashes into me.

We plunge into its depths, gripping each other, and our screams end with a grunt as we land on something soft and putrid.

I gag and flounder in panic as I try to make sense of my pitch black surroundings. 

""Bodies!"" I shriek as my hand cracks through brittle ribs and sinks into a decomposed chest. ""Real bodies!""

""N-no way,"" Del pants, hyperventilating.

I'm not a monster.;9;3;"We don’t need to tell stories when there are true horrors living among us. Some humans are the real, truly terrifying monsters in this godforsaken tale we call the universe.

Their methods can vary widely, but the goal is always the same: inflict the worst possible pain on the least deserving person.

Some of them prefer emotional pain, the long-term bug gnawing at your brain and spilling its poison constantly, infecting every single aspect of your existence. It grabs your soul with its spindly legs and pulls, guiding your behaviour and your essence in every moment, refusing to let go, be reined in, or removed. You can attack it with medications and mantras and modern methods, but like a cockroach it survives and scampers into a corner waiting to emerge. And the kicker? The victims convince themselves it’s their own fault, and the monsters continue to inflict suffering without facing consequences.

Others are more direct and prefer the instant gratification that comes from physical pain. Their implements of choice vary as widely as the number of people they affect. They range from the single psychopath slicing skin, tearing flesh from bone, savouring the screams and  suffering of an individual, to the tenacious terrorist that tears through teeming crowds with a torrent of ammo and explosives, only looking to top their tally. Where these monsters lack the long-term impact, they make up for with the sheer scale, violence, and finality of their actions. There is no treating the condition called death.

Anyone truly human wouldn’t dream of doing any of these things. They’re abhorrent. And the monsters who do...well, doesn’t it benefit everyone if they’re not around?

Did some innocent people die in the process? Absolutely. I could not have predicted how many would drink the punch any more than I can predict when the next rain will come. But the harm I prevented is worth the sacrifice.

How many would have suffered, were it not for my act? How many souls were spared a lifetime of misery, or the short brutality of unimaginable pain followed by the end of their existence? 

How many monsters did I slay, for you, for him, for everyone in here?

It was quick, it was painless, and it was for the greater good. I took no pleasure in it beyond the knowledge that it was for the better.

You asked for my last words. Well, here they are:

Hatred;21;0;"I have a twin and she is an evil cunt.
Every day when I wake up I see her. She rarely smiles. She seems to have no sense of personal space. Its one reason I hate her so much. She looks into my eyes and begins prodding my face. Pointing out all of the acne, the new and sore spots that sprang up from my face over night. 
I know this acne isn't my fault. I know she causes it. When I am sleeping she tends to lay her hand on my cheek. And no matter how many times I demand and beg her to stop she refuses. 
She never says nice things. She calls me worthless, pathetic, fat and a failure. 
She reaches down and pinches my fat rolls. Jiggles my second chin. Watches the fat roll over my thigh when she shakes it. She takes perverse pleasure in pointing out my flaws and making tears roll down my cheeks. 
Tears are something she considers a weakness. Any sign of emotion will cause another attack from her. If I cry I am timorous. When I smile, for a second, she will consider me beautiful but then my teeth show and again I am ugly. 
I hate her. I want her gone. She does nothing but make my life miserable.

People like my boss, the delivery-men from Amazon, even my neighbours across the street. The claws dig so deeply but they never seem to notice.

I’ve tried telling people, when none of the monsters are around to hear. They just look at me like I’m crazy.

I know they’re not hallucinations. I’ve seen people walking around them when they’re lying on the ground, nudging them when they need to pass by. They just don’t acknowledge or even realize that they’re doing it.

You might say if they’re not harming anything, why not just ignore them? Even if I could, which I can’t, they look so nightmarish, they’re not harmless. I’ve walked past them tearing apart the homeless in the dead of night and devouring them till not even bones are left. 

I don’t know why I can see them.I just woke up one day, and there they were everywhere, like they’ve always been around us. There was one on the telemarketer knocking on my door, poking its head over his shoulders. I gave a mild gasp when I saw it and I swear to you it turned its head towards me and *stared*. I don’t know why I didn’t say anything, maybe I instinctively knew it was a bad idea. I just shooed them away and slammed the door shut.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how long I can ignore them. They’re not going anywhere, and it seems like they’re reproducing, there’s more and more of them around me every passing day. I can’t even acknowledge them, let alone fight or kill them.

There was this young woman. We were on the same bus, those monsters, there were about six of them around us.

She was behind me, and I suppose she must have started seeing them right then, because she screamed. Before I could even blink, all of the gremlins turned and leapt at her. I didn’t dare turn around. My heart raced and I tried to focus on my clammy hands, trying to just browse Twitter, while she shrieked in agony and the sound of meat tearing off bone echoed throughout the bus.

And all this time, everyone on the bus just ignored it, looking down into their phones or glancing out the window.

Eventually the silence roared and the monsters trudged back to where they were.

When I got off the bus, I gathered the courage to turn for a peek. There wasn’t any blood, bones or bits left behind.  All I could see was a cracked iPhone that fell into the aisle, and a pair of Nike sneakers neatly tucked under the seat.";16189495100
The Mushroom Cloud;192;15;"I clutched my daughter’s hand while looking at the mushroom cloud.  She squeezed back.  Looking into her emerald eyes, I saw reflected golden fields waving in the wind and in the distance the encroaching wall.  She looked back; I couldn’t hold her gaze.

“How long do you think we have, dad?” she asked.

“By the looks of it, five minutes,” I replied.

“And there’s definitely nowhere to go?” she plead.  Her appeal was a chisel to my heart.

After gulping back a tear, I drew a shaky breath and exhaled a whispered, “No.”   

Every surrounding town had already succumbed to Mother Nature’s solution.  I had brought Lorna to the only place I could, but even in our desperate escape, I already knew that we were in the final square on the board and had been checkmated by the Queen.

We held onto one another as the first few spores drifted down upon us.  We breathed them in and it wasn’t long before we were choking.  It wasn’t long after that when we stopped, having blacked out.

I remember dreams of Alice in Wonderland, although I cannot recall what they were.  I was left with a sense of wickedness and hatred mixed with beautiful wonder and one horrific image:  that of a world filled with wriggling human forms coated in a mossy substance.  That’s when I woke.

I couldn’t see.  My eyes felt like they’d been crusted shut as if I had conjunctivitis.  I could barely breathe.  I could feel that my shallow breaths were circulating around some growth in my lungs.  I could hear, but only what seemed like winter’s silencing soft snowfall.  I felt warmth and humidity.  I couldn’t move, but struggled to.  With tremendous effort, I blinked, but it took many blinks to free my eyelids.  When I did, the first thing I noticed was white string everywhere.  This was mycelium- the web-like, living organism that took over our planet.  This was Mother Nature’s way to balance everything again.  I was woven through and through with it and I knew that the reason I couldn’t breathe well was because of the fruiting mushrooms growing in my lungs.  The fact that I was conscious at all was a miracle.

My eyes focused and I could make out a form in front of me.  My heart pounded and my shallow breathing became ragged as I recognized Lorna.  I could still see her, but the view was clouded.  I shuddered as I tried to scream, but ended up wheezing weakly.  Her emerald eyes were now milky blue.

Time passed in an odd way that I can’t describe, but during this time, I cursed God, the Fates, the mushrooms and anyone else I could think of for allowing me to live through this.  The only thing I wanted was to fade into black and not be forced to stare into my dead daughter’s eyes.  I wanted to throw up when a single cap exploded from her pupil.";16188948750
A Ghost Whispered This Story To Me;42;0;"I was taking a walk through the city at night.

It was late and quiet. Only a few cars drove past, their insides empty of human occupants.

I saw the front door of a house open and shut, but no one entered or left.

A plane flew overhead, and I knew if I flew up there and peaked in, I would find it empty.  

Finally, I saw somebody. Some man was swinging from a tree. When I got closer, I saw he was dangling by a rope hugging him tightly about the neck. Blood pooled in his face, ready to pop like a squeezed berry. He saw me and smiled as much as he could’ve.

I found some shears in the yard and cut him down. He tried speaking but was incapable. I pointed to his tongue on the ground flopping like a blind insect, and he shrugged, shook my hand, and walked inside his house.

I walked on. The next person I heard before I saw. She was kneeling on the sidewalk, screaming inhumanly loud, but no people came out to inspect. She looked flayed or burned. Either way, her red body glistened, and she banged her fists on the floor, howling! For a second, I thought I was in the presence of a fiend demanding entrance back to Hell.

I turned and ran because her voiced agony made me all too aware of my own.

When I got home, the sun was up.

Doors were flapping open and closing like bats awakening. I heard a quick crashing of footsteps, and then a heat passed through me. The television snapped on, plates and silverware clanged in the kitchen. The machines in my house were alive and moving of their own volition.

I slunk to the ground and sobbed - and I’m still here! Kneeling and beating the floor like that skinless woman. My family doesn’t try to comfort me because they cannot perceive me, just as I cannot perceive them. And it will continue like this until one of them dies and joins me in this lonely, phantom realm.";16189187610
Ghosts on the Shore;65;8;"“I’m not sure what you are, exactly.” I told the stiff figure standing near me, stacking up the pyre with as much dry wood as I could find. “But I know you aren’t what you claim to be.” 


The figure grunted. I used to call him Johnny, before I figured out what was going on here. 


The pyre was at waist height, but I wanted it bigger. I wanted this whole island burned down. It’s been weeks since I’ve been stranded here, and I’ve finally accepted the situation; I wasn’t getting away from here. 


That meant I had to stop the others from leaving, also. 


They aren’t people, I know that now. Some speak in languages I’ve never heard of, others speak old english, some don’t speak at all anymore, like Johnny. 


Ever since I stumbled onto the cave and found the bodies, the others have been quiet. They don’t help me find supplies, or tell me stories anymore. 


Searching for food, I found the cave. Isabela, her name was, begged me not to go near it just yet, but I couldn’t help myself. 


Bodies lined the ground and walls. Hundreds of them. I panicked, retreating to get Isabella to verify what I’ve seen, but she was gone.  


I went back to the cave myself, mustering up the courage to look again. All the heads were blank, as if someone wiped their faces off with an eraser. 


I yelped like a little girl when one of them stood up, wearing the same torn shirt I had kept on since the shipwreck. He looked just like me, darker skin, scars in the right places, everything except for my face. 


So I ran back to my little makeshift camp. Of course, nobody was around. There was one note sitting in the little leaf hut I called home. 


LET HIM HAVE YOU. IT IS WHY YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE. IT DOESN’T HURT FOR VERY LONG.


I made up my mind that night. I stayed up all night gathering dried branches. I’d catch a glimpse of someone watching me before I remembered they weren’t people, they were just some THING wearing a human face. 


The pyre branched out across the island, leading into the cave. I figured if I could scorch the very sand of the island, it could kill whatever was inside the cave. Some of the others began to gather around, watching my little spark grow into the largest fire we’ve had on the island.  


“You don’t know what it’s like to live without a name,” one of them croaked out. “Let my brother take yours. It is why you were summoned.”


That made me grin. “Then I’ll be the last.” 


With that, I waded out into the sea, watching from the cold water as the flames began to engulf the island. The ghosts on the shore watched with sorrow, and I glanced up at the night sky, counting the endless sea of stars as the flames reflected on the surface.  ";16189046760

Mother Dearest;48;5;"""This dinner is perfect!,"" Billy said as he took another bite with his fork.

""Only the best for my growing boy,"" Billy's Mother said with a warm smile.

Billy said nothing, and continued stuffing his face. His mother just watched with admiration as he finished his entire plate.

Upon finishing Billy got straight up, and gave his mother a kiss on the cheek, and went up to his room to play his console, something he did a lot. His mother did not mind tho, as she always knew where he was, and that he was safe.

The next morning his mother called him down for his breakfast, she had made her famous homemade sausages, Billy's favourite.

Billy rushed down the stairs, ""Smells really good mum,"" he said as he sat down and took a sip of orange juice. ""You need to keep your strength up my little soldier,"" she replied as she placed his plate in front of him. 

As Billy took his first bite, he noticed that his mother had a bandage covering her entire leg, ""Did you hurt yourself mum?,"" Billy said with a clear worried look on his face. ""Its fine sweetheart, I spilled some hot oil on my leg, I will be fine,"" she replied with a smile.

Hours passed by, and Billy returned home from school, his mother greeted him as she always did, as Billy was hugging his mum, he noticed that the back of her shirt was soaked with blood, ""Mum your bleeding!,"" he said with a worried tone.

""Oh that, I'm fine honey, I slipped, and cut my back, no need to worry, I'll put dinner on,"" she said as she kissed him on the cheek. Billy did not buy into her story, but he decided to just forget about it.

His mother called him down for dinner, and Billy rushed down the stairs. ""Is my baby hungry?,"" his mother said as she laid a plate of pork chops, and mash potatoes in front of him. As he was eating he noticed that his mother seemed rather pale in her complexion, but he put it down to feeling a little sick.

Five days pass by, and Billy sits at the table enjoying his dinner, his mother sat opposite him, ""You really outdone yourself this time mum, this steak tartare is delicious,"" he said with a mouthful of food. ""O-o-only the b-best for my b-b-boy,"" she mumbled as she was gasping for breath. The cuts that covered her entire body were now showing signs of rot, the stumps where her legs, and one of her arms once were oozed with puss.

The Dragon in Her Drawings;12;8;"I met Karla in kindergarten. We had good times, found a dead cat once and hid it in the bushes surrounding the playground so we could watch the changes over the days and weeks. 

Schooldays came and Karla‘s talent for drawing, worth no more than a pat on the head before, mutated into something that hushed people and dropped jaws. Her dreams she fused with what she saw, turning her favorite teacher into a space knight who fought a dragon living in the top of a giant tree. Details went way beyond what Karla should have been able to accomplish at that age, from the teacher‘s eyes so alive you expected to hear his battle cry any second to the shredded remains of unsuccessful preceding space knights between the dragon‘s teeth. That last particular Karla’s parents didn’t like. 

My friend’s space knight teacher however would triumph over the beast as she liked him a lot. Way too much for my own personal taste, that’s why I put some of her Pokémon underwear in his bag for which they came and took him away. 

Karla started drawing me then, and she did it in ways that made me look bad, like I was that dragon from the trees poorly disguised as human. When I protested, she insisted it was what she saw. 

I thought she’d get over it, but instead it got worse. Karla made me a lurker in the shade of the desert sun, a lizard feeding on a bound and screaming man‘s intestines. She grew up to make a living of these detractions, telling reporters and curators she didn’t really understand herself where all those images came from. 

„It‘s me,“ I said to her one day. „Always me. Is it still because of that teacher?“ It had been twenty years (!) since he threw himself in front of that train. „How much longer will you hold this against me?“ 
Karla ignored me while having a video chat with a friend. „Where is he now?“ the little face on the little screen asked. Karla sobbed. „Sitting next to me,“ she said. 

I knew that friend and hated her guts, so I gave her the finger. She ignored me just as Karla had. 
„You know he’s not really there, right?“ that awful person said. „You took the pills?“
„They’re not helping anymore. He’s always there.“ 
„Calm down,“ her „friend“ said. „Breathe. What do you say, come over and sleep at my place?“ 
Karla smiled with tears and snot dropping from her lips. „Thank you.“

I watched her stuffing socks and contact lenses and a toothbrush in her backpack, scratching my chest with my talons. 
Yeah, thank you, I thought. Thanks for the invitation, bitch. Wait until I show you how grateful I really am. We‘ll turn you into art, my friend and I.";16189302170
Where the Stories Come From;24;5;"On this subreddit, we like to  believe our stories come ""out of the aether""... but what if I told you the ""aether"" was a real place; an infinite conveyer belt that occasionally drops one of its priceless loads into the minds of mortal humans?

And on this conveyor belt there exist things like: an immortal unicorn stuffed into a tiny dog crate by an evil witch, never to know freedom again; a dog with the face of a sad old man, that accidentally sold his soul to the devil at a young age, and never stops weeping; a child with an infinite pocket full of baked beans, that is slowly eating himself to death. 

But the one that scares me is the toe-eyed man. As you can imagine, he has toes where his eyes should be. And he never stops screaming, because every time a toe wiggles (on his eye, hands, or foot), he gets a vision of a future. OUR future. And it is bleak indeed. 

But the terrifying thing about the toe-eyed man is, he has taken up a hobby, to take away some of the pain. Story-telling. 

And just as we can pull these horrendous creations out of the aether, sometimes they can pull us out as well. Ever heard of the ""Missing 411""? 

All I'm saying is, maybe stay out of the woods for a bit.";16189129370
Real;984;23;"We were told to make *them* as lifelike as possible. That’s what upper management wanted, so that’s what we did. It took years to perfect, but we did a pretty good job. As a result, they look like exactly us, act like exactly us. They *are* exactly like us, at least from the outside. The only difference is that deep within their carbon fiber skeletons, they aren’t in control. Sometimes I wonder if they know what they really are. We never told them, maybe thinking that they wouldn’t understand or care, maybe out of some small measure of pity.

We saw them as just a *thing*, never anything remotely close to what we are. But I think there was a moment of doubt for each of us, a moment when we looked at them and saw ourselves. We wondered, for that moment, if maybe we were no more than them. Maybe all our memories had only ever been imagined, or worse, someone had planted them there, the same way we planted memories for *them*.

Danielle had always been especially affected by it. She didn’t believe that *they* couldn’t really think, couldn’t really feel. Sometimes she would talk to me about it. I watched as her doubts began to develop into a festering tumor. Her fears hatched like squirming maggots, greedily devouring her reason. The bulbous lumps of uncertainty swelled in her mind, ready to pop.

I guess she just couldn’t take it anymore, couldn’t *not know* anymore.

I guess I shouldn’t be so surprised to see her now, the way she is. I shouldn’t be surprised to see her exposed bones scraped of flesh, disturbingly white against the backdrop of her naked, pulsating veins. I shouldn’t be surprised to see the blood dripping from the mutilated, twitching muscles that are still connected to her arm only by thin strips of skin. There is *so* much blood, too much blood. The blood is so dark, so full, so *real*. 

The stained knife slips from her shaking hand and clatters to the ground when she notices me. She sees the revulsion in my eyes. She sees how I try to look away, but can’t. She tries to explain.

“I had to make sure… had to make sure I’m *real*,” she says, eyes pleading for understanding. “I had to make sure that I wasn’t one of *them*.”";16188327890
It's Always Watching Me.;18;4;"*I'm not crazy.*


It's just your eyes playing tricks on you, they said. Maybe you need to lay off watching TV before bed? As if what I've been seeing and hearing over these past few months has been all inside my head. How can they dismiss me? How can they not understand the danger I'm in? How can they not comprehend the immediate threat to my very life and ignore my pleas for help?! I'm so very tired, and I just don't know what to do anymore.



I'm writing this as a final effort, one more try to figure out what is hunting me..watching me..always watching me.



*I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy.*


It started as something I would see out of the corner of my eye, it would be so quick but I know what I saw was real. Over time it became more obvious, the flashes in the far reaches of my vision became quick reflections in the mirror. I'd blink and it would be gone, but the terror of what I saw would remain. I would see its dark, pale, and yet almost..beautiful eyes watching me. Staring at me from vents, from other cars as I drove, in my phone's camera when I'd go to take a picture, just watching me. Always watching me.



Forever silent, but so deafening I could not focus on anything else. Invisible to all else around me, but in plain sight.



*I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy.*


I tried seeking help. My friends, family, and co-workers all told me it was in my head. that I was making it up. I spoke to the police and I was laughed out of the station. Of course, they didn't believe me. They thought I was playing a trick or that I “might be crazy”. I thought maybe they were right, I sought out the aid of a shrink who was little help himself. I'd lay on his soft leather couch and tell him about the things I'd see. All while those dark, pale eyes and beautiful eyes were watching me.



Always, always watching me. It never sleeps, it never blinks, it never breaks its gaze on me and I even see it in my dreams. 



***I'm. Not. Crazy.***



Now I'm just..so tired. I'm so tired of trying to explain, trying to rationalize, and trying to fight. I'm just so very tired. I can see it now, it's right in front of me. I see it as clearly as I can see this screen. It's staring at me over my laptop as I write what was supposed to be my last-ditch effort for help, for an explanation. Now, I think this shall be my eulogy. I feel a sense of calm washing over me as it's beginning to creep towards me. I can see all of it now. It's horrifying and yet...magnificent. All this time, I was afraid. Afraid of why it was watching, always watching. 


Now, it's offering a hand. It wishes to take me away from all of this. As I stare into it'd dark..pale..and beautiful eyes. I feel...I feel...nothing. Absolutely...nothing and it's so...it's...so...peaceful.

Dinner And A Show;220;17;" ""I'm making some more of that stew, is that okay, Mike?"" Yelled my wife, Linda.

""That was an amazing stew, but, fourth night in a row?"" I shouted back. 

""It's that or nothing!""

""Stew it is then!"" I was in the living room, bored and flicking through the channels. I finally stopped on the news. *I know him* I thought. It was our neighbour, Ben.

The pre-recorded press conference cut away, and the feed went back to the news presenter in the studio.

*""That was Ben Kane, Abigales father, at yesterdays press conference, pleading for his daughters safe return. We now go Live to the corner of West Street, where our news correspondent, Julia Black, has the latest on the story...Julia?""*

*""Four year old Abigale Kane was last seen here 5 days ago with her Jolly-Holly doll, which is highly distinctive by her bright pink hair and silver stripes, playing innocently on her own front lawn...""*

""Linda?...Linda!...You best come see this!"" I yelled.

""What? What's wrong?"" She asked, poking her head through the door way.

""Look."" I pointed at our TV. ""Abigale from next door...she's been taken.""

""What?""

""Look, it's a Live feed...That's our house!"" I quickly stand and walk towards the window.

Just a mere thirty-feet away, were at least a dozen policeoffers, some with sniffer-dogs, four TV news-vans and all the crew, and an ever growing crowd of nosey neighbours.

""We should come away from the windows."" Said Linda. ""I don't want any of them to see us."" She practically shoved me out the way and abruptly pulled the curtains shut.

*""It's been just over 4 days now since Abigail was first reported missing, and as you can see behind me, the police are still patrolling the area with sniffer dogs, hoping to pick up any kind of lead.""*

""Erm, I'm just going to the freezer out back, Mike. Will you keep an eye on the stew?""

""Uh-huh."" I was trying to listen to the reporter.

""Don't let it boil over, okay?""

""Uh-huh.""

*""...even though the police have widened the search area, they are still...oh hold on, what's this?...Have they found something?...""*

The reporters voice trailed off as my concentration diverted to the sound of the stew boiling over, and I quickly darted into the kitchen. Just then, Linda strolled back through the door, empty handed and white as a ghost.

""You okay? I asked. ""Thought you were going to the freezer?""

""Just needed to sort something."" She answered, quite flatly. ""Here, let me take over.""

I continued to watch the live feed.

*""...Officer?! Excuse-me, Officer?! What did you find? The people have a right to know!""*

The cameraman pointed and zoomed in on the officers hand.

*""...It appears to be the Jolly-Holly doll! It's covered in mud I believe, perhaps some blood?...Officer?! What did you find? Did you find Abigale?!...*""

Here comes the accidents;1;1;"
I am a security guard for a building and we always get little rascals trying to break in and run around and steal anything that they can get their hands on. I call these kids accidents because their parents clearly didn't mean to have them but maybe recklessly forgot to use protection. My co-worker calls these kids benefit absorbers because their parents also most likely had them for a life on benefits. I was working the nights and these kids tried to get into the building and I chuckled ""here come the accidents""

As the ferrel kids were banging on the doors I shouted at these kids ""hey accidents fuck off!"" And the kids stopped banging on the doors and were just staring at me walking towards them. I went outside to have a word with them. They started to act hard and tried to intimidate me and I told them ""can you accidents just go else where!""

""Why are you calling us accidents?"" One kid asked me

""Cause each of your parents definitely didn't plan to have any of you"" I replied with a smirk

""You might have been accidental as well"" another kid told me

""Hey listen up my mom and dad were definitely concious and willing when they decided to have me"" I retorted

They ran off and I told this to my mom about the incident and then she became sad and was looking awkward. She admitted to me that I was an accident and I couldn't believe it at all. It ruined my whole life and perspective and I decided to change my style and tone of voice exactly like those kids. I started hanging around with them breaking into buildings, stealing cars, stabbing people and dancing on bloodied ground. I started doing this because I am an accident and I wasn't supposed to be here.

As I was rolling with this gang they then told me that I had to murder someone to be fully part of their gang member, and I had to murder someone whose parents planned to have them. They found such a man and tied him up for me to kill him. As I looked down on this crying man a thought came to me and I turned around to my gang and I told them ""we are all accidents. The big bang was an accident, the formation of planets and stars was an accident, the sun being in the right distance from the earth to cause life and billions of years of evolution for us all to be here was an accident. So in a sense all of existence is an accident and so this man who you want me to kill is also an accident""

I have walked away from that gang ever since.";16189502770

I think if that was true I'd be at home, in a skirt.

Not here in pants and a *cage*. It goes around the whole wretched birth defect that got me in here.

A Conversion Camp is what this place is. Run by zealots, and funded by still more of the same. Their agenda is simple. Conform or, die.

For some like me, conforming is easy. The risk of willing Conversion far outweighed by the fear of prejudice. The procedure boasts a meager fifty percent survival rate.

The only other option is for us to live in fear, do the best we can to hide what we are.

They tell us that fear is the Devil. That we are what we know ourselves to be. That their god gave us The Procedure as a test of Faith.

If I have Faith I will survive. 

I will be

Looking at him then, slumped against the cell wall, it was hard to believe he was a killer. His skin hung from his emaciated frame like melting candle wax, his fingers bloody from dragging across the concrete. When I approached, he continued to stare straight past me.

&#x200B;

*“You wanted to see me, Mason?”*

&#x200B;

*“Warden,”* he croaked, *“About tomorrow...”*

&#x200B;

*“Your fate is sealed, you will hang for your crimes.”*

&#x200B;

*“No, you don’t understand… That won’t stop It,”* he replied, his eyes finally meeting mine. A shiver ran up my spine at their soullessness.

&#x200B;

*“It?”*

&#x200B;

Mason rushed at the bars, his skull slamming into the iron with sickening force.

&#x200B;

*“The demon! It won’t stop It! It will return, It will find another host! It will kill again!”* he screamed, blood pouring from his forehead. Sickened, I stumbled back from his cell.

&#x200B;

*“Burn It at the stake! Let It die with my ashes!”* he begged, his features grotesque with madness.

&#x200B;

*“Mason,”* I shook my head, unhappy to find my voice quivering, *“This is no possession. What you have is a sickness of the mind... Nevertheless, what you did to those women… you will face the gallows for it.”*

&#x200B;

His desperate cries echoed through the halls as I turned and walked away.

&#x200B;

*“Burn It! Burn It alive!”*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Mason dropped and the noose went taut. Yet those wicked, soulless pupils bore into mine even as he struggled and choked.

&#x200B;

My body went cold, I was unable to escape his gaze. The world around began spinning, soon everything went black.

&#x200B;

I awoke some time later to a nurse bandaging my throbbing temple.

&#x200B;

""Warden, you're awake! Goodness, you had yourself quite a fall! Well, no one can blame you for fainting with the way he was looking at you!""

&#x200B;

She carried on but my attention was on the throbbing in my head.

&#x200B;

That steady pounding that came from blood rushing through my veins.

&#x200B;

*Blood*

&#x200B;

I had never been so acutely aware of it before, how vital it really is.

&#x200B;

The nurse finished my wrappings and went across the room to retrieve something. I watched her every movement, thinking about all the vital blood her veins held.

&#x200B;

""That should heal up just fine!"" she proclaimed, holding a mirror up to my soulless eyes just before I lunged for her throat.";16188285970
Itch.;115;13;"I've felt a bit of itching under my skin recently, like it's in my bones, writhing around. Have you ever felt that? It's almost like they're squirming inside of you ever so slightly, just enough to bother you.  

Have you ever seen Columbo? Real good show, Columbo. He's a smart guy, real smart. I've been watching the old reruns on TV lately, really the only thing I've had to occupy my time outside of the picking and the scratching and whatnot. I'm told I'm smart, I can do math real well, but I'm not exactly present, I guess. It's just kinda hard to process these kinds of things.  

So I've got Columbo on and it's finally ripping open, right? A bit of red's shooting out, still can't see the bone, but it's so goddamn itchy that I just have to keep going. Fuckin' irritating is what it is.  

It hurts, yeah, of course it does, but that itching is driving me fucking insane. Fingernails haven't been washed or cut recently, haven't really had the time. They're starting to get uneven, but it makes 'em better at digging through the skin if you ask me.  

So I'm picking away at this shit, watching Columbo on my old box TV, and I finally have my big break. I can see these red little bumps on the bone now, little fucking things they are, and I'm able to finally scratch them.  

But it moves.  

My arm is jerking around almost like it's trying to avoid me. It's flying around and I don't hear Columbo anymore and it's moving why the fuck is it moving and my god does it itch.  

So I get up and it starts going fucking crazy. Smacking around left to right, it jerks to the side and scrapes open a little more on the wall, making a real goddamn mess of things, and I find my toolbox somewhere in the back of the closet. 

It's just spasming now, like it's panicking or something. Like it knows what's about to happen. 

So I get out my hammer, and I do what anyone in my situation would do.  

And it still fucking itches.";16188268300
I don't know which stories of mine are fiction?;11;6;"
I don't know which one of my stories are fiction and which ones are non-fiction, oh my god. I scroll down my Reddit account and I gasp in horror and I tell myself that they are all fiction but I am not sure any more. I wake up filled with anxiety and dread at thinking that maybe all of my stories are non-fiction. I pray to God that all of my stories are fiction I pray so hard, I just don't know which ones are made up to which ones are real. I am trying my hardest to not scroll down my Reddit page because it would just out me in such a fright.

Please some body just tell me that all of my stories are fiction with proof and I am running out of luck. I just want to keep telling myself that all of my stories are fiction but I don't believe it at all, and I start going bezerk because I am sick and tired of wondering whether my stories are fiction or non-fiction. I hate myself and love myself at the same time. I sometimes hum ""my stories are fiction"" up to a thousand times and when I don't believe myself I start to scream.

I then go outside and start grab holding strangers and I start to shout at them ""my work is fiction!"" And some have even punched me in the face. I truly don't know whether my stories are fiction or non-fiction. Please something anything just tell me my stories are fiction. They need to be fiction they have to be fiction. The only things that tell me that my work is fiction are lifeless objects and I know that must not be a proper reassurance, as they are lifeless objects.

I am sure this story is fiction, I think.";16188628250
The Truth About the Pied Piper of Hamelin;103;6;"The good people of Hamelin lived something of a charmed life in the year of 1284


Food was abundant, disease unheard of. Men grew fat. 


Ale flowed liberally. Whores were clean, and cheap. 


Every day, new babies were born alive.


There was nary a storm-cloud in the sky.


Except…


Sometimes a traveler would arrive, with an empty belly and weary feet.


Beggars didn't pose a problem; their flesh fed the pigs. Minstrels and musicians met a similar fate, after playing for the prosperous townspeople. Playing with a frenzied terror, whilst thirsty faces circled.


But pilgrims, often of noble stock, were something of a worry. 


And there were many pilgrims. Germany was, of course, the largest territory of the Holy Roman Empire. Germans saw themselves as the very protectors of the Catholic faith.


Well, MOST Germans. Not the good people of Hamelin.


Every time a pilgrim arrived, the townspeople put on a song and dance, something of a well-drilled performance. Everyone knew their lines; they'd practiced so many times. 


The Cathedral, filled with many obscenities, was off-limits, despite the pilgrim's pleadings. 


""Closed for repair; ever so sorry,"" the bishop would sadly sigh.


Whores dressed as nuns. Many a pilgrim remarked with joy that they'd never known a town home so many hundreds of nuns.


And ""young"" Hans, who ever seemed to be maybe eight years old, played merry childish games in the market square.


Every pilgrim eventually departed, remarking on ""what a quaint slice of Heaven"" Hamelin appeared to be.


Except one. 


A very elderly man, a great composer, harbored a fair few suspicions. It seems that he'd been to Hamelin before, so long ago that no-one remembered him. 


And long ago, he'd seen the same faces. The same nuns, the same boy playing the same merry games.


These faces hadn't aged a day.


The very elderly man, of very noble standing, wearing a fine, flowing robe, demanded answers.


What were the townspeople to do? They couldn't drink, then dispose of, a nobleman. others would come, looking for him. Prying eyes.


So the very elderly man left unsatiated, promising to return promptly with a Holy Roman Army to ""test you merry devils"".


The desperate people of Hamelin, amidst much wailing and heartache, spared a newborn's life. This baby was presented to the commander of the pope's soldiers, as ""the first child born since the terrible day"" when an evil musician had led all of their children away by his infernal pipe-playing.


Only young Hans had remained behind, and the sobbing, crippled boy confirmed the story. He'd been too slow, had lagged behind; but he'd seen the Piper lead the children into his magic cave, before sealing the entrance behind them.


Hans' description of the piper perfectly matched the inquisitive nobleman.


But Hamelin had drawn too much attention, and a garrison of soldiers stayed. The good people of Hamelin began to grow old, and die; and death almost felt a blessed relief from the terrible thirst they ever felt.";16188101160
The Breech;132;23;"I wrapped my arms all the way around Millie’s distended belly and snuggled into her neck.  She’d bore us five wonderful children and was so close to number six.  She turned to look at me smiling in the dusty sunlight streaming in through the kitchen window and kissed me.  The love we shared was a belly full of warmth.   

I looked back at the dust swirling its patterns in the beam.  It always seems like an echo of the universe we’re in and the miracle of being able to see it at all.  I mean, think about it, we live on a ball of collected dust which circles a living explosion.  Our sun, being just one of billions, itself circles a supermassive black hole along with clouds of gas which birth new stars regularly.  And our black hole is just one in billions.  I once saw a lighter flick in slow-mo and thought, *Yeah, that’s us right there: infinitesimally small creatures of consciousness inside a momentary spark allowed to see it because time is relative to size*.  Or maybe I’m just crazy.  Millie says I am when I talk this way.  Regardless, being born of such violence means not all miracles are what we understand as positive.

The kids all started setting the table and I still had a few chores to do, so I set out for the barn and left Millie cooking.

We lived miles from any hospital or doctor even.  Growing up, I’d learned birth through the farm and had a ton of experience doing it before Millie and I even had our first.  So, the decision to home birth was a pretty easy one to make.  I’d already done it five times before with her and all the kids came out just fine.

I heard her piercing scream from the barn.  Throwing down the pitchfork, I rushed into the house.  There was a puddle on the kitchen floor and I heard another scream from the bedroom upstairs, so I joined the bustle of activity.

As I reached her side, I smiled at her, but something in the way she looked made my stomach cramp.  She screamed again and I saw a movement from her belly.

*She shouldn’t be this far along already*, I thought peeking under the sheet and indeed she wasn’t.  I felt for the baby’s form in her stomach and realized it was breech and because her cervix hadn’t expanded enough, there would be no way for a natural birth.

Another movement from the belly caused my wife’s blood-curdling scream to fill the room.  That’s when I saw her eyes roll up into her head and she passed out.

Quickly, I grabbed the sharpest knife I could and cut along her belly, desperate to get the baby out and save my wife.

I spread apart the incision and was shocked to discover that the baby had tunneled through my wife and  the mattress leaving a bloody, black hole in its wake.";16187867530
They watch;27;1;I would sleep on my right side, after all it's much more comfortable, and offers a cooler side of the mattress. But....the right side is facing the wall.

Will I Ever be Free from HIM?;802;22;"  

I knew I couldn’t escape from him. But I had to at least try. 

The motel room stinks like mildew. It’s silent except for the chirping crickets outside and the humming sound coming from the furnace below me. Vermillion shag carpet tickles the bare bottoms of my feet as I swing my legs off the side of the bed. 

Waiting. 

Still free, for now. For a little while longer. 

But he’s coming. 

I scratch the itch on the back of my neck that never goes away. Where he planted the microchip in me. 

Footsteps outside.

He’s found me. 

I had no choice but to stop. I had to rest, to recharge my batteries and just sit for a while. Sleep was out of the question, knowing he was just behind me always. But I couldn’t keep driving any longer. 

You can’t live behind the wheel of a car, never stopping except to fill the gas tank. That’s no life for anyone. 

The doorknob turns and I see him open it.

He steps inside, his pale skin looks yellow in the dim light. His rotten teeth and purple gums show themselves in a smile and he seems almost giddy at the whimpering groan that escapes my lips. 

“Dearie,” he says, holding out the black collar with its chain. “It’s time to come home.”

I stay firmly put, not moving an inch. 

My feet are no longer dancing across the soft tickling shag carpet floor, but I let them linger there, hovering over the tips of the fibers, feeling it for as long as I can. 

Feeling the freedom of this motel room away from the coldness and lonesomeness of his modernistic castle. 

Just because you live in a big house doesn’t mean you’re happy. 

He pulls out the stun gun from his back pocket and shows me the lightning at the tip of it. Raises his eyebrows and waits for me to move. 

There’s no point resisting any longer. 

I stand up on trembling legs and walk over to him and he smiles wider. Triumphant. 

But then the red and blue lights appear suddenly, coming around the corner. 

A quick chirp from a siren and part of me becomes ecstatic. 

I’m SAVED! It says. 

Another, more cynical part, says no. He’ll get away with this like he always does. Just wait. 

The police officer comes over to us, looks down at the stun gun in my husband’s hand.  

He forgot to put it away! Maybe luck will be on my side tonight after all.

“Sir, you know it’s a crime to use those on them. They can still feel pain, even if they are just companion robots. I’ve heard their AI is actually pretty sophisticated.”

He looks embarrassed for a second, but only a second, and puts it away. 

“Come along now, miss.”

He puts a hand on my lower back and leads me towards my husband’s car. 

I’ll never be free. 

Not until he’s dead.";16187388080
Smoking Barrels.;58;2;"""I told you to stay home Bill"" I stammered, desperately trying to pull the hammer on my pistol back, blood pooling under my tongue. ""I told you to stay home man, stay with your family, one of us was supposed to make it!""

Bill didn't reply. It wasn't Bill anymore. The bloody horns jutting out of his skull told me he was long gone, one of those things. The snow began to fall harder, the wildfire around us ate greedily at the brush.

""We were at Gettysburg together Bill, we survived as the frontmen in the formation, survived bayonet charges. We always pulled through the worst of the fighting. Brothers in arms.""

Bill didn't reply. It wasn't Bill anymore. He started towards me, all broken and twisted. Growling like a feral dog.

I couldn't move, he'd gored me with his horns and thrown me against this tree. It didn't help that I'd lost my left arm in the war and the right one was a gashed up mess. He was up close now, I could see the black emptiness in his eyes, the jagged maw he had for a mouth now. 

I felt the hammer rest into the last position, a loud click, enough of a noise to make Bill stop. I raised my arm up, my barrel lined up with his nose. I don't think he understood what a pistol was anymore.

""Brothers to the end Bill.""";16187834500
Hell Of A Time;24;2;"The last thing I ever saw before leaving the physical realm was being cornered by the police, and then BANG, gunshots ripped through my body, then complete darkness took over me.

A light suddenly formed out of the utter blackness that clouded my vision, I found myself approaching it at a rapid pace, then I suddenly came to a pause, and my new reality was forming before my very eyes. The smell of burning flesh entered my nostrils, a smell I could never mistake, it smelled just like Julia as I disposed of her body, the smell was kind of arousing.

So lost in my nostalgic thoughts, I never noticed the agonising screams all around me right away, but when I did it was like the most beautiful music to my ears. Two tall beings that I can only describe as goats that walked on two legs approached me, the first one grabbed my arms, and the second grabbed my legs, then they proceeded to chuck me on some kind of trolly, and I sat back and enjoyed the ride.

As we approached my unknown destination I could not help but admire the lovely view on the way, there was mutilated body parts everywhere, people being ripped in half by the same goat like creatures that kindly helped me into my ride, I was very pleased that they decided to take the scenic route.

We finally arrived, and I was helped off the trolly, and was taken to the most lovely throne I had ever seen, it was made of human bones with four skulls rising from the back. Sitting upon the throne was a very different looking creature, this one had two horns protruding from its skull, and it had red skin, I knew straight away this was the big cheese himself.

He told me some shit about eternal damnation, and a load of other crap I never paid attention to, this place was just too distracting with its aura of absolute beauty. 

I was taken back to the trolly, or as I like to call it, the tour bus, and taken to my new residence. My eyes lit up as I saw what awaited me, these guys love to play rough, and I like it. The goat men, or as I like to refer to them as Basil, and Keith proceeded to insert hooks into my ballsack, and hung me up until they ripped leaving me wanting more, they really know how to party down here.

The next day was even better than the first, I had my nipples removed with a dull knife, the feeling was bliss, especially when Keith started rubbing salt over it, and pouring acid on my ripped ballsack.

Basil was a right lad, he loved to laugh as he flayed my skin, but that is just good old Bazza for you.

Those religious nuts were right all along, heaven does exist, and they know how to party here!.";16187985120
Do You Fear the Darkness?;6;1;"I never fear the walk when I am lonesome on a dreary night. I like the peace and quiet it offers. It is not a comfort my busy mind allows me to enjoy often. The blackness of the night is like a soft, warm blanket shielding me from the cold world. I often find myself walking alone at night of my own choice. To be quite honest and frank, it is the only time I feel as if I am not going to implode with trepidation. Some people may find that a bit awful and odd, but I cannot help what I have fallen so helplessly for. 

Of my own volition, I find myself walking this very night. The cool autumn breeze carries the smell of decaying, wet leaves. The slight click of my dress shoes on the pavement creates a steady rhythm with my lightly thumping heart. Ah, it is a good day to be walking with one's self as the sun is gladly vacant. My mind feels clear for the first time in awhile, I would say. I adore my walking, but, alas, it must end. I must return home, so I bid my serenity adieu.

The street lights cast a harsh light on my vision as I start to make my way back to the lazy town I call home. The light seems to chase me all the way to my door step. I never fear walking alone in the dark, it is the light that makes me fear. I open my door, and hurry in. Dawn will be rising before too long, and I would much prefer to be a man locked away. 

I sit in my chair as the city slowly wakes. I wonder how many people fear, my love, the dark. Fools, all of them. Their focus of the darkness has made them blind to the true threat. They should fear the light and what it hides in its rays. A real monster knows how to walk in the day light, and make sure you never know what it is until it is too late.";16188195150
Martyr;70;2;"
The prisoner labored as he pulled air into his body, wheezing and croaking with each rise and fall of his chest. His skeletal frame was laid bare; bed sores exposed and rotting. He heard footsteps approaching his cell, and wondered when he last saw a human face.

It took some time for his eyes to gain focus, and for his ears to decode the sound waves. He felt submerged.

“Good evening, Mr. Kovalev.” The figure before him said.

Drawing from all available reserves, all the prisoner could muster was a hushed “food, please,” through painful, broken lips.

“Now, now, Mr. Kovalev let’s not be too hasty. You’re on a hunger strike,” the man moved in closer and whispered, “you’re dying for the cause!”

Fully depleted the prisoner could only let out a deep rasp, but the message was received.

“I suppose you cannot hear them -- the crowds. They’re here, outside, for you, comrade!”

“They chant your name, tens of thousands of them!”

“Your demise will spark a revolution! The Party trembles before us, they are scrambling to suppress the uprisings. In Volgograd, the people have already chased out the last of those corrupt devils. Lyuban and Chelyabinsk are next to fall, and protests are alight in all the major cities.”

“You are a legend, comrade. You are the bullet the people needed to end those tyrants.”

“You are a martyr!”

The word rang in the prisoner’s mind. He was no martyr, he thought, but a sacrifice. His body was a sarcophagus. He wondered if future generations would ever open him up, and see the claw marks inside.";16187703910
I am not a psychopath;27;3;"
I am not a psychopath and many people think that I am a psychopath for some odd reason. I have also found out a way to temporarily stop people thinking that I am a psychopath. Gerome is an over weight man who thought that I was an actual psychopath. I tried to tell Gerome that I am not a psychopath and as much as Gerome would've liked to believe me, he kept on thinking that I am a psychopath. I asked Gerome whether he would like to stop thinking that I am a psychopath? And Gerome agreed gleefully that he would like to stop thinking that I am a psychopath.

He agreed to let me help him stop having thoughts that I am a psychopath and he took a month off work so that I could help him to stop thinking that I was a psychopath. He was going to live in my house for a month and go through the therapy so to speak which cures people temporarily of thinking that I am a psychopath. At first I started strangling him for long periods of times until he became unconscious. When he came out of the darkness he started to smile because he didn't think that I was a psychopath anymore. I was glad but I knew it was only for limited time that gerome wouldn't think of me as a psychopath.

When he started to think that I was a psychopath again I got him in a choke hold once more, and as I was choking him out again I kept on saying to him ""I am not a psychopath"" and Gerome would say ""you are not a psychopath"" as he was being choked out by me. Then when Gerome was unconscious I looked down at his body just thinking about how much I hated work and then eventually gerome came out of the unconscious state. He was even happier this time and didn't think that I was a psychopath anymore and started hugging and kissing me. He also started to do things which he couldn't do as a teenager like getting drunk and getting high off drugs.

The second time round lasted longer than the 1st time but now I was going to use a knife to help Gerome stop thinking of me as a psychopath. When I first held the sharp edge of the knife against his flabby body, I kept on saying to him ""I am not a psychopath"" and Gerome kept on replying ""you are not a psychopath"" and when the pain reached a certain level I stopped immediately. Gerome smiled as he didn't think that I was a psychopath anymore but I know that it's only for a limited time. Each time he goes back to thinking of me as a psychopath, the knife will only go deeper.";16187763510
New Generation;190;9;"Robin watched the fat kidnapper dial his father's number again. He heard the phone ring, followed by dad's voicemail message, then the robot voice saying the mailbox was full. The kidnapper howled with rage, fought the urge to slam his phone into the concrete floor, and instead stabbed aggressively at the hang-up button, fuming.

There were three of them, all a few years younger than his parents. Robin had nicknamed them Fatso, Beardo, and Scrawny. They were too incompetent to instill fear; he'd seen scarier people on the Internet. Besides, he had slowly worked his hands out of their poorly-tied ropes. He was just waiting for the right moment.

Fatso stormed over to Robin. ""All right, you little *twerp*! How do we find them?""

Robin stared back calmly. ""I *gave* you their phone numbers.""

""How about *where* they work?"" Beardo sputtered.

""They're gig workers,"" Robin explained. ""They're driving somewhere.""

Scrawny snorted derisively. ""So what do *you* do when you want to see them?""

""I wait at home until midnight,"" Robin deadpanned. ""That usually works.""

""What if there's an *emergency*?"" Beardo seemed incredulous.

""I can take care of myself.""

Fatso grabbed a battery-powered drill. ""Oh, yeah? Try taking care of *this*!"" He approached Robin menacingly, the drill screeching.

Robin kicked his shoe off, hitting Fatso squarely in the eye; he hunched over. Catching the tumbling drill, Robin drove it straight into Fatso's eye, then pushed him hard; he fell on Beardo, trapping him. Scrawny drew his firearm and prepared to fire. But Robin had already fetched a knife from Fatso's belt and thrown it expertly at Scrawny's throat. With a gurgle, he went down. Robin leaped on him and waved the knife like a conductor's baton, shredding his flesh. The deluge of blood quickly spread outward.

Robin spun around to find Beardo trying to free himself from under Fatso; he froze when he saw Robin approach. ""How did you *do* that?""

""I've been throwing knives since I was three. YouTube tutorials."" Robin knelt before Beardo, studying his throat impassively.

""How does this not *bother* you?"" Beardo pleaded. With a fluid, expert motion, Robin slashed his neck in several places. ""I've been watching people die on the Internet since I was four."" The blood gushed out in multiple streams, pumping like a living fountain. Well, a dying one. Robin smirked; he had always wanted to try that method. He let himself out and walked home.

Robin heard someone enter the apartment. Padding out of his bedroom, he found his exhausted mother, smelling like the greasy food she delivered tonight. He noticed it was 11:30PM. ""*You're* home early.""

She yawned heavily. ""Hi, sweetie. Dinner is served."" She had a selection of canceled deliveries.

Mom smiled sadly as she served orange chicken. ""I'm sorry I'm not here for you.""

He nibbled an extra spicy buffalo wing. ""It's OK, I can take care of myself.""

""How was your day? Anything interesting happen?""

He took a big bite from a jalapeno popper. ""Nothing worth mentioning.""";16187347430
Have You Teeth?;1444;161;"Mother would always warn me about teeth. *Ain’t natural*, she’d say. *The way they grow, from inside your skull and out, like a fuckin’ violation from within.* So she’d rip them out you know, always made sure we were all infected gums and none of that calcium shit. Incidentally, that’s how my sister died. 

Moving on, I’m older now. Teenager I guess, all red flaring pus-dripping open wounds, no chattering here, no siree. All squishy-squashy. Mother would check my mouth periodically, making sure no violations protruded. That’s not how it works, I’ve been told. Didn’t know that back then though. So, just to be sure, she’d dig around in the wounds with forks.

The flyer on my nightstand wasn’t there before. Did mother put it there? Oh, I apologize, I’m moving tooth fast, aren’t I? To calcify, clarify, there was a flyer on my nightstand, and it wasn’t there before.

HAVE YOU TEETH? the big ol’ round-faced man on the flyer inquired. He had many. Perfectly square, unnaturally so, identical chompers. Very, um, becoming. Unbecoming.

Years go by like an ache, slow and steady and uncompromising, and one day mother acci, uh, dentally, hangs herself in the barn, hands tied behind her back. She has this smile on her face, toothy grin I suppose, and it dawns on me she’d been keeping our dental discharge all to herself, and for some reason decided it’d be a good idea to stick’em into her bleeding gums on this particular day. 

HAVE YOU TEETH? the man asks me, creeping up from behind a haystack. 

I shake my head. Mother’s dead bulging eyes follow the man as he dances around me mockingly.

YOU WANT TEETH?

Yes please.

I buried her next to my sister in the basement, but I made sure to give him our teeth, a hallowed offering mother rudely refused him way back when. He feasted on them with great oral pleasure, molars of all shapes and sizes crunching to fragments under the pressure of those perfectly square chompers. 

In a way, mother was right. It feels alien, doesn’t it? Unnatural. Things growing inside you, squeezing through tiny holes, pores, like a violation from within, the pressure and pain of which leaves you in spasms on the floor gasping for air.

The worst are the eyes, you know. They protrude sideways up from within the socket, piercing the vitreous body, slowly working their way through the lens, and the pupil, and the cornea. Then you have to reach in there, part the wound, feel around with your finger until you find it. Yanking it out doesn’t always work, so sometimes you have to stick pliers in there.

SNAP

He’s at your door the moment he smells it. You wonder for a moment if it’s all worth it. Skin of teeth, eyes of teeth, nails of teeth, genitals of teeth, organs of teeth. Of course it is. You smile, big old mouthful of teeth, and you open the door.

She Just Needed a Short Break;160;5;"Inside the house, the mother was not crying- in fact, she was exerting a truly inspiring amount of effort to not cry. Stress had carved itself into her eye sockets, into her cheeks, into her frizzled hair, into her tight lips.

""It's just been too much, you know?"" she said. Her friend reached out and touched her hand, and the touch turned into a warm grip. She gripped that hand back hard.

Paulina had brought her children over to her friend's house, fighting them all the way. Jack was still too young to cooperate with her. She struggled to guide his little limbs into his onesie. Beth Anne was old enough to understand what her mom wanted her to do, but had been pushing the envelope ever since she learned how to say ""no."" The hope was that her friend's dogs would distract the babies and entertain them. It seemed more promising than parking them in front of YouTube again; she always felt guilty about that when she resorted to it.

""Jesus, I mean, I'm just wiped out. All day, every day. I love them, but between my shifts at the diner and Tommy going to the training program, I literally cannot get a single second to concentrate and just *be*, you know? Like, I can't even do the dishes without sprinting into the other room because Jackie tripped and fell and started screaming-""

""Oh, I know. It gets easier once they get older, but then you're gonna have a whole new set of emergencies,"" Linda said, wryly,

""I'm looking forward to it, hahaha. At least I'll be able to get some downtime between disasters.""

""Mommy!""

""Hey, sweetness, Mommy and your Aunt Linda are talking now, okay? Can you find Jackie and play with him?""

""But Mom!""

""Beth Anne!""

""Okay...""

Her friend Linda refilled the glasses with lemonade.

It was a beautiful day at Linda's house. The sunlight was bright and clear, the wind was *just* strong enough to cool off your face but not enough to ruffle your clothes, the clouds were practically paintings. A lovely day for a lounge in the backyard. Unfortunately, Paulina was allergic to the pollen from the park that was just down the road, and the breeze was flowing the exact wrong way for her. She and Linda were inside while the babies played outside with Higgins and Gunner, Linda's Bull Terrier mixes. The adults could still see them through the glass door, when they looked up.

""Mommy!"" Beth Anne screamed at the top of her lungs.

A harsh temper flared up inside and was instantly quashed. Paulina would never show anger in front of her kids, ever. ""Honey...!"" And Paulina shut the fuck up.

She was crying. Why was Beth Anne crying?

""Honey, come here. What's wrong?""

Outside the glass door, Higgins and Gunner were chewing on Jackie's bones, still strapped into the booster seat. They'd taken him by the throat first, and his shrieks had only been little gurgles until they'd stopped.";16187351890
Standardized Tests;231;23;"As Sam Ellis sat down to take the test, the green light at the front of the desk lit up. The results of this test would determine if he went on to the next grade in junior high.

The first questions were in English. As he answered them, the green light stayed steadily lit. Whew. The next section was math. Not so easy. For the first ten questions the light stayed green. Then he missed a couple of questions and the green light blinked off and the middle light, a yellow one, came on. Not good.

Social studies was the next section of the test. After getting a few questions right, the yellow light went out and the green light lit again. Thank goodness.

The next section was science, a weak area for Sam. He got the first several questions right, the light stayed green. Then he missed a couple and the lights changed to yellow again. Ouch. Another missed question, the yellow light stayed lit when he missed it. Sam was sweating now. He had to nail the next few questions.

Two more questions. Both were missed. The yellow light went off and the red light came on. Oh shit. Those were Sam’s last words as he felt the needle inject the fast-acting neurotoxin.

Many people feel we should eliminate high-stakes testing in our children’s schools.";16187262610
"I Am an ""Empath"" but That Doesn't Mean What You Think It Does";230;17;" 

I am an empath. Not in the way you might think though, anyone is capable of being empathetic. Well, most people. I literally feel what other people feel. I was walking down the sidewalk the other day, when I saw somebody trip and fall. I didn't physically fall down, but she had hit her head, and it looked painful. It probably should've been, but she got up as if nothing had even happened. I, on the other hand, starting screaming. The pain pounding against the edge of my head. It throbbed and jabbed at me, until eventually the pain subsided. Later that day, as I peered at myself in the mirror I saw a giant bruise. 

That wasn't the only thing that had happened. When I was a kid, my friends and I liked to climb trees. We had been climbing one particularly high tree, when my friend Joey slipped. Joey screamed as he fell to the ground. He landed directly on his elbow, but it didn't seem to phase him. He got back up almost immediately. I was still hanging onto the tree limb, when I heard a loud crack. My elbow had snapped out of place. I screamed in agony and let go off the tree, I fell and broke not only my left arm, but my right arm as well. 

I had recognized this curse of mine at a very young age. It honestly made me rather reclusive. I didn't want to take other peoples' pain or misfortunate. One day, that could seriously hurt ME. I became depressed and mostly just stuck to myself after that. I would do the things I have to do, like go to work (I work the night shift to avoid people), and go to the grocery store. Other then that, I am a loner. The world is heavy, and I refuse to take on the weight of everybody else's pain. ";16187236360
mothers brain transplant;26;1;"
   As I lay my head in my mother’s hands, I remember how well she raised me, how she treated me with the utmost kindness, always. I slowly stood up, gripping the hatchet inside of my bag, and one fatal swing to my mother’s head was all I needed to get her ready for the operation. 

   A brain transplant, though we could not afford it I know my plan will work. Mother’s dementia worsened day by day and to see her suffer and be unable to attend to my needs was world shattering. I sobbed and whimpered as I slowly made a slice around the skull, taking care to leave the brain untouched, until I pulled it out slopping the brain out onto the floor. I tried to maneuver it through the gushes of blood and other body liquids, squishing it into a bowl. I’ll need that soon. 

   “Mother you gave everything you had to me so now I will do the same mom I’m going to save you, I’ll do what you did for me I’m going to make you happy again mommy”

   I raised the hatched and braced myself for the indubitable pain. All will be well soon. Mom just needs a new brain. As I scribbled out a frantic note of instructions for the brain transplant for whoever happened to find us and see my noble sacrifice. 

   I drove the hatchet into my skull, and draaaaggged it around as much as I could. no br ain.  dama ge at all my br ai n is fine for mommy. 

   I laid on the floor next to her and grabbed her hand, shoving my half-skull into hers. I grabbed my hatchet one last time and raised it as far as my limp limbs could allow me, severing the brain from the rest of myself. 

   I awoke next to my mother, hand in hand, smiling into her face as the blinding white light consumed us both. Oh yes it must be the surgical room light, my plan was so foolproof, of course someone found us.
   
   Mother looked at me with a look of terror in her eyes, oh mother why do you fear me? I saved you. I gave you a new brain mommy. Now we can spend forever together! And you will remember every moment. :)";16187606570
He Was In My Room Again Last Night;31;3;"The breathy silence in the dining room gave stage to the incessant ticking of the pendulum clock, drowning out the occasional clatter of cutlery from the family of four; each sat at the dining table with heads hung low, averting their gaze from one another. 

The youngest, growing more agitated with each tick of the clock—wanting to look to her right, but quickly changing her mind—began to tap her plate with her fork in rhythm with the tick-tick-tock.

“Don’t tap your fork,” her father scolded. She shot him a glance and continued tapping. She watched him carve his meal with large, exaggerated movements as if he were trying to display a pretence of insouciance, if only out of spite.   

“He was in my room again last night,” she stated factually, and paused for a reply.

Tick-tick-tock went the pendulum clock, along with her fork on the plate.

“He was in my room again last night,” she repeated, and startled back at the sudden crash of tableware as her father slammed down his hands.

“What do you want me to do about it?!” he barked. 

“Dear, please…” her mother pleaded, still holding her knife and fork as if she were just about to begin eating, as she always was, but never does.  

Tick-tick-tock went the pendulum clock, along with the fork on the plate.

He exhaled deeply and shifted his focus back to his meal. He lowered his voice to a firm but vexed growl and said, “If it happens again, just close your eyes, pull the duvet over your head, and wait until he leaves. Just like every other time.”

Tick-tick-tock went the pendulum clock, along with the fork on the plate.

There was another crash of tableware, “And GODDAMMIT, stop tapping your fucking fork!” He pinned his eyes on hers, casting his finger, visibility seething—yet still taking extra care to not let his gaze drift to her right. 

“But—it’s not me,” she stuttered in response with wide open, glaring eyes.

Tick-tick-tock went the pendulum clock, along with the fork on his plate.

The girl watched as her father’s tightened lips loosened to a slackened jaw; and as his narrowed eyes widened; and as his flushed face drained to a pallid pale of dawning realisation.    

“My god…” her mother gasped. 

“Don’t look at him,” her father snapped back.

“But he’s never—” the mother cried out.

“Don’t do it!” he warned, now rising to his feet.

“He might be better—” she begged. 

“—He isn’t!” 

Tick-tick-tock went the pendulum clock, along with the fork on his plate.

“—But my baby boy!”

“DON’T!”

The girl watched as her father leaped from his chair, and she shut her eyes at the sudden shrill shriek of her mother. There was a commotion, followed by a clamour of shattering glass, followed by a stillness. Eventually, the silence gave stage to the tick-tick-tock of the pendulum clock, along with the tapping of three forks against their plates.";16187550340
Why I Don't Trust Wild Horses;46;3;"I thought it was going to be a miracle to finally go on vacation. I was going to do some horse riding in Scotland with some of my friends. I was wrong beyond belief. 

Me and Mac were riding along one of the trails, courtesy of Sam, our friend living in Aviemore, who had agreed to come with us. We were admiring the frankly breathtaking scenery, courtesy of the Scottish Highlands. Suddenly, our horses get spooked. When I say spooked, I mean they reared and bucked us off. Falling off a horse is not a pleasant thing, even with protective gear. Then, the horses just suddenly run off. It was completely unlike a tamed horse to suddenly buck off its rider and run off with no actual threat in the area.

When we got up and dusted ourselves off, Sam noted, ""They can't have gone too far. Actually, there's a loch close by."" So, of course, we headed for the loch. We saw one of the horses, standing completely on its own. It was the one I was riding.

Or so I thought.

When Mac and I got close enough to stroke it without spooking it, everything went wrong. I suddenly found my hand stuck to the horse's flank. I tried to pull my hand away with my free hand, but nothing worked, like the horse was covered in superglue. Then, I noticed something even weirder. Its hind legs appeared to be backwards.

Sam started screaming, ""Get away from it! It's not a horse!"" Suddenly, Mac said, ""Hey! My hands! They're stuck!"" Then, the horse started walking towards the lake with us still attached to it. I tried so hard to unstick my hand, but nothing worked. I used my free hand to try to search my pockets. I knew what I was going to have to do.

The cold water of the loch eventually started to rise around us. I frantically searched, and found the pocket knife. Then, Mac and I were submerged in the loch.

What I saw next will haunt me for the rest of my days.

The horse's mane looked like dead seaweed. Its hide had turned a sickly dark green. Its face... Oh, God, its face. Its teeth were now exposed, and had changed to look like enormous fangs. Its eyes were just glowing white orbs.

I brought the knife to my wrist and started cutting. It was absolute agony. I screamed as I severed my hand. I floated up to the surface, and passed out onshore. Sam got me to the hospital.

Mac's body was never found.

I can never look at a wild horse the same way again.";16187430950
(Un)Conditional Love;14;2;"She knew she had to do it

But the mere thought 

Had Victoria’s stomach all in knots

What would her parents do?

Would they love her if they knew?

She just couldn't judge

How conditional their love really was?

Would they send her away

Where she’ll be forced to pray?

Victoria acted tough, but inside she knew well

Abandonment would rip her heart out like nothing else

She felt her father would take it better 

Father always saying he loved her

It was clearly true

But her mother’s thoughts were another issue



So she put it off and out of her mind

That closet door stayed shut tight

But over time, as she collected lies,

Slowly but surely, she was dying inside 

The fear was eating her

The pressure was on

She couldn’t tell the truth when asked what was wrong

Upon learning she’d been set her up with her neighbors son 

That’s when the fear finally won



Both parents were working late

So she settled on a means of escape

She looked upon her pocket knife, a gift from her father

And a few painkillers, don't make this harder

When her mother came home that night 

In Victoria’s room was a God Awful fright

Victoria choked trying to speak the truth,

But in writing she was skilled

Her mother realized her daughter wasn’t killed

With shaky hands, her mother grasped the note

Sorrow washed over as she read the last thing her daughter ever wrote

She wept over the corpse, the clear result of 

Victoria's uncertainty of unconditional love";16187478380
Jimmy waves;608;31;"His body rode the tide in and washed ashore.  I’d overheard the deputy talk about how bloated it was while munching a danish.  I watched his mouth move and could see the mash shift from side to side during his description before washing it down with a mouthful of coffee.  He said Jimmy had become as fat as Mrs. Ballard, but smelled ten times worse.  I could hardly imagine.  Mrs. Ballard was so large she couldn’t fit through her own bathroom door, so her husband built her one outside.  She still never used it.

Jimmy White was a great kid.  At eighteen he was brimming with life and had that exuberant “I can do anything” attitude that comes with youth.  *He shouldn’t have had to die* is what most people in town were saying.  *He certainly shouldn’t have been murdered*, they’d say.

The last time I’d seen him in such high spirits was a week prior.  He rushed into my general store with a wave.  He was soaking wet, holding a soggy letter.  Even the storm outside couldn’t rain on his parade.

“Mr. Adair, you won’t believe it,” he exclaimed.  “Look!” he continued, jamming the dripping letter into my hands.  I skim read his acceptance to Harvard.

“Damn, Jimmy.  Great job!” I told him, smiling widely.  “Your parents must be proud.”

“I’m off to tell them right now!” He laughed a little as he took the letter back and continued, “You were the first stop on my way back from the Post Office!”

He raced out the door, just as my son entered.

“What did Mr Perfection want?” he asked.

Robert is a great son.  I love him with all my heart.  I wish he saw that, but he seems to be in an eternal,  dark cloud, not unlike the swirling steel ones overhead that day.

“He got accepted to Harvard and wanted to share,” I told him.

He looked at me and it pierced my heart.  “Of course he did,” was all he said as he brushed past me to go get his apron.  The rest of the shift we worked silently side by side, an invisible wall of friction separating us.

That night after dinner, I took a walk in the whipping wind and wound up on the beach watching the frothing surf.  Piles of debris, deposited by the swells, dotted the shoreline.  As I looked, I saw a murky form standing and knew immediately it was Jimmy.

I grabbed a piece of driftwood and approached him silently.  He had no idea as I took aim and cracked his skull.  He dropped as if all his bones had disappeared.  As quickly as I could, I found some cord and hog-tied him.  As I did, he woke up.

He looked at me confused and asked, “Why?”

“Some kids will do anything to make their parents happy,”  I said.  “And some parents will do anything to make their kids happy.”

I watched Jimmy leave with a wave.";16186585670
The Harbinger;63;1;"Everyone in Braxton knows the legend of the Harbinger. It’s one of those stories you grow up hearing about, usually told by older kids or adults who want to scare you. Not everyone believes in the Harbinger of course, most residents think it’s just an urban legend. But those who *do* believe take it very seriously.

The Harbinger is said to be an omen of death and ill fortune. Some say it’s a ghost, some call it a demon, and a few even think it’s some kind of alien. In any case, seeing it is a sign that something *bad* is coming, either for the area or for you personally.

The first recorded sightings of the Harbinger date back to August of 1975. Motorists on the 18th Street bridge that spanned the Mason river reported seeing a strange black mist appearing on the bridge, taking the form of a human before vanishing. 

The figure was seen at least ten times before the bridge collapsed during rush-hour traffic in the last days of summer. Thirty people were killed, with dozens more injured.

The next sighting came in December of 1984. A shadowy mist with glowing blue eyes appeared around the suburban home of the Jenkins family, peering through the windows and frightening those inside. At least six sightings were reported by the family and neighbors in the weeks leading up to Christmas.

Then in the wee hours of the morning the day after Christmas a fire broke out, consuming the home in a raging inferno and killing the family of five that lived within. An investigation afterwards determined loose wiring in the attic sparked the blaze.

The Harbinger wasn’t seen again until May of 1998. The black mist was sighted multiple times in the north halls of the Hamilton Inn, where it would let out an unearthly shriek before dissipating. Many guests checked out early, but others checked in hoping to catch a glimpse of Braxton’s mysterious phantom.

During a sunny afternoon on the first day of June, an explosion tore through the north section of the hotel, killing nineteen and causing tens of thousands in damage. Turns out a release valve in the basement boiler was defective, causing pressure to build and turning it into a time bomb.

That was the last “official” sighting of the Braxton Harbinger. The being has become a part of modern American folklore, putting Braxton on the map. Residents are always speculating when the Harbinger will show up next.

But it won’t for a while.

Not until I learn to better control my powers.

Try as I might, I can’t seem to completely project myself back in time. My form is but a shadow, my eyes glow like searchlights, and my voice comes out as a shriek.

But still, I keep trying.

Many disasters have struck Braxton over the years. I'm sure one of these days I’ll finally succeed at *warning* people about the coming tragedies before lives are lost.";16187022580

There is something inside me;22;3;"I first saw it while on my bed and going through my phone. Something wiggled under the skin of my forearm and a slight bump raised. 

It felt like a muscle twitch at first but when I glanced over, there was a distinct moving lump.

I nearly threw my phone and screamed but the instant I reached for my arm the lump lowered back into me.

In a panic I drove myself to the emergency room.

After they examined my arm and found nothing wrong the best they could do was an x-ray and taking blood work. They told me they’d expect results in a few days.

I went home and showered. I sat under the water and hugged my knees to my chest just hoping that maybe I overreacted.

Maybe it was just a muscle cramp and I imagined the bump.

But the twitch returned and a lump raised on my kneecap before my eyes.

I just stared at it, frozen. 

I watched my skin strain to contain it as it pushed back and forth before retreating again. 

It wasn’t painful but the sensation found me to vomiting into the toilet. 

I knelt there sobbing before exhaustion took me and I collapsed in the bathroom.

I woke on my back to a twisting in my stomach. I reached for it with my eyes closed and felt the something writhing under my skin before diving deeper inside of me.

I pulled myself into clothes and went back to the hospital. 

The twisting became more frequent during the drive. Something moved in my calf, then up my back, before wiggling behind my cheek.

I was pale and staggering when I stumbled through the hospital doors. 

They admitted me and I was put in a small curtained bed. 

The writhing stopped. 

I laid in peace as the nurse took my information again and the doctor examined me thoroughly. 

They poked and prodded my appendages for what felt like hours, massaging muscles, while pinching and shifting flesh.

The search resulted in nothing.

Whatever is inside me stopped.

They said they would hold me until the previous blood work came back and would consider a full body scan. 

Then they left me.

They drew the curtain and lowered the lights.

Laying in silence I tried to comprehend what was happening.

But slower than ever before I felt something swim inside me. It went up across my ribs and towards my throat.

I screamed.

I thrashed.

Orderlies came and restrained me. 

I was taken to the full body scan immediately.

I laid still while I passed into the machine.

I prayed for it to end.

And I know know it will.

A man in a suit arrived the next day to talk to my doctor. After they exchanged words he escorted me to a new room and drew a gun.

There is something inside me and it can’t get out.";16187192150

The dream;21;1;"I woke up this morning from a terrible dream. 

My wife and I had flown out to our friend’s house in Indiana from the West coast. We were having a surprise birthday celebration for Mac, but really it was just an excuse to hang out for a week together. It was too rare these days, especially after Mac and Linda had moved to the middle of the country. 

In the dream, my wife and I had been in a guest room and we had been talking about…something.  Dreams often leave those details pretty vague. But whatever it was, it angered me. Angered me enough that I picked up the knife that was magically beside me, and I stabbed her with it. Killed her. 

Mac came into the room and asked me what I had done. I was emotionless, as one tends to be in a dream, and I told him I killed her. He looked at her, then at me. 

“Alright man, we’ll figure it out.” He said. 

Mac is a good friend, the type of guy that will give you the shirt off his back and will be there for you no matter what. But he also tends to do “the right thing.”

He turned to leave the room and I followed him out. Once we got to the hallway, the knife appeared in my hand again, dreams are convenient that way. I grabbed my friend Mac from behind, and I slipped the knife into his chest as I wrapped my arms around him. It was so real, but still had that distant and observable feeling of a dream. Like I was seeing it from a camera rather that actually doing the deed. 

Stab, stab, stab. I held Mac up for a moment as I felt the life drain from him. He didn’t really thrash around as one would expect. He just sort of slumped down in my arms and got heavier. I eased him to the ground, because he was still my best friend, and then I watched in my dream camera, as I disappeared into three other rooms. 

I was standing in Mac’s living room next to his very non living body. From the kitchen, Mac’s kid walk in with a bowl of chips. He looked at his dad, a pool of blood now staining the carpet beneath him, then shrugged his shoulders and walked upstairs. 

Then I woke up. 

In a mild panic for what I may have done, I looked over at my wife, sleeping beside me. Her soft snores told me she was alive, and assured me it was just a dream. I got up to go get some water. 

Stepping over Mac’s cold and lifeless body, I went into his kitchen and grabbed a glass from the cupboard.";16187058720
The Toilet;343;15;"Jade really needed to go. But she was afraid.

*What's so scary about a toilet?* she asked herself. *It's just a toilet.*

This particular one was a hulking white beast, grinning at her from across the cubicle. The toilet flushed by itself, as if to say it promised to give her the best hug she would ever have in her life.

Jade didn't buy it. She wanted to run far away from these toilets, especially after hearing whispers that they were *haunted.* But all the other toilets were--very conveniently--locked. Except for this one.

And Jade was very urgent.

*It's just a toilet. Don't be silly. You heard too many stories.*

With that, and the reassurance her imagination was just running wild, Jade crossed over into the cubicle. The door locked behind her. There was no going back.

Her shorts fell onto the floor. She sat down.

*See? There's nothing to be scared of.*

Then she felt something sharp sinking into her flesh. Blood dribbled onto the floor.

She looked down to find little teeth, sharp and pointed like little fangs, pressing hard against her flesh, cutting in as deep as a knife through butter. Bits of Jade tumbled into the toilet bowl, where the water swirled round and round in a crimson whirlpool, before disappearing into the deep abyss below.

Then the toilet heaved, and crumpled neatly into itself.  Jade *screamed*, though no one but herself could hear her, as her spine curled all the way into itself, then snapped cleanly into half. The bottom half of Jade fell in first, and little teeth emerged out from the inside of the bowl and tore her gleefully into pieces. This was followed by the top half. Blood gushed out as Jade's nose was taken from her. Her eyeballs popped out from the pressure, and instantly disappeared. Then came the digestive juices, and the acid, which burned what's left of her, and skin dripped from her bones like melted wax.

Her glasses, coated with a thick metal frame, was the last thing left. Round and round the crimson whirlpool it swam, then it too, vanished into the deep abyss below.

Then the red drained out of the water, leaving it crystal-clear. The teeth retreated back into the toilet. The door unlocked by itself. If anybody happened to be nearby, she would've sworn she heard the toilet burp.

Jade's friend Summer walked inside the cubicle, calling her name.

""Jade?"" she yelled, worried. ""I thought I heard you screaming inside. What's going on?""

The door locked behind her. Summer gulped. The toilet grinned at her.

It gurgled happily.";16186461410
Biological;20;1;"The colony of Harcen was small and new, barely a decade old and still little more than an agrarian town with a population measured in five digits. Its people were humble, lived simply, and happy in their lives on an alien planet.

They were also, as of yesterday, at war.

It was, in the peoples’ minds, a technicality. Their colony was on the edge of inhabited space, and of no actual value. All that would happen is a broadcast in a few weeks, indicating that the war was over, or that the colony was under new management.

\-

Carol was working in the orchard when the ship breached Harcen’s atmosphere.

For a few moments it simply hung ponderously above them, resembling nothing more than a giant river stone. Then it began to broadcast a message by loudspeaker.

“People of Harcen VI, this is Captain Argos of the Colonial Acquisitions Inc fleet. It is my duty to inform you that we are at war with your parent corporation. As a result, you have been classified as enemy combatants, and thus forfeit the ability to lodge complaints with the Galactic Board Of Rights. In approximately fifteen minutes, we will be deploying experimental biological weapons to remove all inhabitants.”

Carol stood where her feet had been rooted for the past minutes, unable to process what she had heard.

The loudspeakers issued a small cough, and another message. This message was quieter, without the bluster of the last

“For the record, I’m sorry. I don’t approve of this kind of shock and awe, but I know that’s little consolation. Gods have mercy on you, for they will extend none to me”

\-

Carol did not make it home in time, even if she had she was unsure what she intended to do. She stood on a hill overlooking the town centre as the first bunker fell.

She braced herself as it plummeted, expecting an explosion of some kind, but as it hit the ground with a solid thud she was perplexed. A second fell with the same lack of explosion, then a third.

She had been expecting bombs or gas, not a trio of duds. She felt relief; surely the captain had persuaded his men to sabotage the attack, unable to bear the guilt. She laughed, panic turning to manic joy.

Then the bunker doors opened.

\-

Hanging in low orbit, a room of scientists watched drone footage streaming live. Screens showed terrified faces, bodies being torn limb from limb, the viscera of an entire colony.

Amongst the charnel scene were their magnum opus; black chitin shapes moving from body to body, scything jaws and claws making short work of all that lived.

They made notes on the efficiency of their living weapons, comparing thoughts on future improvements, until a voice spoke above them

""It's over, Ava. it's all-- everything is gone."" he replies coldly. Stammering and stuttering, she utters, ""I'm-- I'm here Allen! please.. D-don't."". ""It's not enough, you're not enough, it's never enough"". Allen whispers as a gentle night breeze brushes between them. ""No Alle--!"" ""I'm through talking, Ava. go back down, you coming up here to try to convince me that everything is ok, is not going to work."" ""Allen.. this isn't you, this isn't what you are. please stop!!"" ""I don't know what I am. but I know what I need to do. They're all dead, there is no hope, never was."" ""We can find hope Allen, I have hope, let me show you.."" she says. They stare at each from afar, Allen is met with a swelling of dread and starts to choke up, ""Hope.."" he whispers to himself. Ava begins to run to him, a charming woman of average height, fair skin, majestic brown eyes filled and overflowing with desire, and devastation. She latches onto Allen, a tall, slightly darker, rugged man, his once piercing blue eyes are now tired grayed out corneas that can only see what has been lost. ""We can find hope Allen.""  her mascara smears as she buries herself in his black leather jacket. ""I don't want you to go, but I know you won't stay, so I want to go too, with you."" Allen is stunned by her decision ""...together."" she holds him tight, still buried in his chest. ""Ok Ava."" he leans his forehead in touching hers and they kiss, tears from 4 eyes converging at their lips, ""I'm ready"" she says timidly. ""So am I."" He continues to hold and kiss her, as he pulls out from his jacket pocket a polished and decorated pistol. ""I love you Allen. I'll never let you go, baby."" she whimpers. ""I love you too Ava, more than all the stars in this night sky."" He shuts his eyes and quickly points the pistol to her head, pulling the trigger as soon as he felt the end of the barrel touch her soft ear lobe. She falls instantaneously releasing her grip on Allen. He opens his eyes but doesn't dare to look down, he stares instead at the crescent moon. sobbing deeply, he begins to lay down, eyes still fixated into the void night sky. as he lays flat he is surrounded with a warm liquid, a coppery smell surrounds the area around him. Finally, with his right hand, he fixes the gun to his ear as he reaches for Ava's lifeless hand with his left. Stunned, he recalls what she told him, ""We can find hope Allen."" he mutters and begins to count. ""One.... Two....."" he shakes violently and cries out, ""THR---"".";16187532290
The Morning Routine;57;3;"I heard the ringing of my alarm, and gritted my teeth. I wanted more than anything to just stay in bed, but I got up.

I smelled sausage as I walked toward the kitchen. I made one last try at running back to the bedroom, but I couldn't do it.

""Morning, hon."" Claire- my wife- greeted me from the counter. She turned to look at me, and I sucked in my breath. She still looked so much younger. Simpler. The stress lines hadn't aged her face at this point.

""I'm so sorry, Claire."" I said as I sat down. I said it a million times by now, and like always she ignored it, setting a plate down and going to the hall.

""Kids! Get down here!"" She cried out. I heard running, and choked back a sob.

""Morning, daddy!"" Annie greeted as she ran to hug me. I tried to look away, but couldn't. 

""I'm so fucking sorry."" I said through sobs. She didn't react, and just beamed at me. Even though her face was ruined, she still had such a bright smile.

Cody walked in soon after. He was still so small at this point. I couldn't imagine that I could ever hurt something so tiny. He asked me to pick him up, and I obliged. I felt the squish of blood run through my hands as I put him in a seat.

I didn't want to eat, but I did. I tried to block out the conversation my family made over simple things. Things we talked about before we had real issues to worry about. As I leaned over, a bit of blood drizzled down my head, onto the sausage. I closed my eyes and kept eating.

Thankfully, soon it was time for me to go to work. This was back when I had a job. I got up, Claire gave me my coat. I caught her eye, and there was such a warmness in them. She really did love me then.

""She never meant anything to me. Fuck Claire, I'm so fucking sorry."" I don't know why I kept saying it. It didn't change the cheating, the arguments, the accident, or anything I did after. She giggled and kissed me on the nose, and as she turned I could see the neck bruises behind her hair.

I left the house, and got into my car. I looked into the rearview, and saw the gunshot wound on my forehead. I closed my eyes and sighed.

I remember- before leaving for work that morning- wishing that mornings like that could last forever.

And as I heard my alarm go off, and smelled sausage in the air, I started to think that they just might.";16186705140
Roommate;391;26;"I live in a small house just outside of the city. It’s small, but for me it works. There’s just me and my roommate, Rebecca. She needed a place to stay during college, so she moved in with me. My last roommate had just moved out pretty recently, so I didn’t mind. She’s very nice and admittedly rather pretty. Sometimes I even think we could be more than just roommates. But that’s beside the point. 

The house only has one bedroom so when she moved in I let her have it. I sleep in the basement. We share everything else though. Bathroom, kitchen, closets. It’s quaint and maybe a bit dull, but it works for both of us. I never was someone who cared much about having a lot of space, so I’m fine with her taking up most of it and sharing what we can. 

Two weeks ago, Rebecca went on a trip to visit family in Wisconsin. The house has gotten a bit out of shape these last couple months since she moved in. It’s not her fault of course, but I decided I wanted to surprise her. So while she’s been out of town, I went to work. 

The windows were getting a bit raggedy, so I boarded them up. I would’ve liked to do more, but there’s only have enough money and time to do so much you know. I also fixed the locks on the doors, because they’ve been very loose lately. I got rid of some unnecessary things, a bit of silverware here, an old house phone there. Just a little “spring cleaning”, you know? 

She’s supposed to come home later today. I’m getting giddy with excitement. Right now, I’m sitting in the closet, waiting to surprise her. I hope she likes what I’ve done with the place. I mean, it’s always best to make a good first impression with your roommate, isn’t it? ";16186307040
Traction;14;0;"Thing’s hadn’t been the same with him since The Change.

He was her *best* friend. They’d been bros since like kindergarten.

As far as she was concerned, they still should’ve been. She was a lesbian after all. Ripe token material in her tight plaid skinny jeans and matching flannel. Her beanie cap restrains her hair, six inches longer than it was six months ago.

Not as long as it might have been

*Traction*

His energy seemed off when he texted her, too. A short invitation to their usual four wheeling spot.

*Come thru. Sis.*

Hell yeah, her response echoed out-loud to the empty room. 

*Traction.*

She grabbed her keys, her lid, and headed out.

If she could get a little

*Traction*

She could show him. 

Nothing *has* to Change.

*Traction*

She arrived to his face contorted into what she assumed to be his attempt at a smile. It looked almost painful. Clearly forced. Red Flag.

*Traction.*

She started to get uncomfortable halfway down the trail. It was muddy, she had asphalt racing tires on. Sliding through flat areas of the trail, getting bogged down and where was he?

Gone, down some side trail.

*You used to push your* own *rig out, don’t be a* pussy*.*

His words didn’t sting. They weighed her down, blending like cement into the increasing supply of mud on her pants.

*Traction*

He beckoned her to follow down a path she hadn’t seen before. Just after entering the clearing, he tore off. Ditching her again in a game of hide and seek she desperately wanted to stop playing. 

She jams the throttle trying to catch up.

*Traction.*

She didn’t see the root, but her tire found it.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

The rumble of approaching A.T.V.’s jarred her awake. She sat up slowly.  Her four wheeler a few feet in front of her, back tires buried to the lugs in mud.

*Traction*

She threw every ounce of her being into the push. It moved, she climbed up, throttle.

The machine jerked forward, releasing itself from the mud.

The approaching engines became thunder, the patter of mud being flung from her smooth tires resembled rain as he pulled up. A group of jocks in tow. Her old teammates.

*Traction* 

*It would’ve been fine, if you were* just *a girl. That makes sense, but I’ll be* fucked *if my girlfriend is going to share a locker-room with a* dike *like* you

The words he spat at her. 

Her wrist nearly breaks with each desperate pull of the throttle.

*Just please, please some fucking* 

*Traction*.

They encircled her, she was quickly unsaddled by the three or four boys he’d gathered.

*Filthy fucking* freak.

The last words she heard. His hand pressing her face into the mud in front of her back tire.

*But, we’re best friends*.

Her last thought as her A.T.V. finally gets some

Remembrance;1771;30;"Jack led Mary into the restaurant, pulled her seat out at the table and obliged her to sit. He was old fashioned and still believed in maintaining a level of courtesy.

As Jack settled into his own chair he commented on how beautiful his wife looked. She replied that he was only saying that. Jack grinned and told her it was true and would always be true.

The couple started to thumb through the menu, Mary asking her husband if he'd decided what he wanted. Jack nodded.

Scallops for starter. Steak for main. Knickerbocker Glory for afters.

Mary chose scallops as well, followed by lamb rump, followed by chocolate torte.

Jack laughed. ""I knew you'd go for torte,"" He said.

""Do you remember the last time we ate like this?"" Mary asked.

""What with everything that's been going on,"" Her husband replied. ""I imagine quite a long time.""

The scallops appeared first. Meaty with a mint and pea sauce. Mary finished hers first and emitted a delicate burp.

Jack poured Mary a glass of Australian Shiraz to go with their red meat main. Always red with red.

The steak was rare, the blood circling the meat. The lamb was well done, served with a redcurrant jus and dauphinoise potatoes. Jack had chips with his.

""So tender,"" Mary commented. Jack nodded.

After their main, and several glasses of wine, they sat waiting for their dessert.

It was nice to take Mary out for a meal, he thought, just like the old times. She'd lost quite a bit of weight these last few months. He hoped she was enjoying herself.

The desserts appeared and before long they had disappeared.

They finished the last of the wine and made to leave.

Mary placed her hand over Jack's.

""This was lovely, Jack,"" She said. Her husband rubbed her hand.

""I'm sorry the food couldn't be real,"" He said. ""I know how hungry you are.""

Mary smiled. ""I know, sweetheart. Just imagining was wonderful.""

""Shall we go?"" Jack said. Mary nodded. Holding hands they walked outside the restaurant.

Jack looked at Mary. She was so thin. He looked the same: bones with a little bit of skin.

They sat down on the bench outside the restaurant.

In the distance they could see the gigantic alien machines approaching. Huge, stadium-sized things crushing the land underneath. Behind the vehicles they left a smooth mosaic of death, nature and concrete. Cities fell, forests surrendered, mountains crumbled. The lakes, the rivers, the oceans had been solidified by vast aerial vessels raining a cement-like dust onto them.

The world was being polished out like a pearl. Nobody knew what for. The invaders had never attempted communication.

The couple had no more strength to outrun the machines any more.

I'm going to sleep for a bit, Mary said, resting her head on his shoulder. Jack played with Mary's hair as she faded away.

Not long now, he wept, as the noise of the engines drew nearer, and I can join you.";16186001770
I don't know how much respect to give;15;5;"How much respect should I give a person ? Is the question I have been asking myself ever since I moved to this town. Everyone kept on telling me to give each individual their deserved level of respect based on their profession and salary. I could feel the pressure of it all but I ended up not taking it seriously at all. I tend to just respect everyone equally and it's just who I am really. I honestly thought it was a strange thing to do to just respect someone based on their salary and profession.


I was walking on my own one day when a guy said hello to me and when I said hello back he became agitated. He told me that I was giving him too much respect for someone of his own profession. He was a garbage man and he told me that the tone of my voice and body language was too much respect for someone like him because of his profession and salary. I didn't see the problem though and when I was still showing him the supposed wrong amount of respect towards him, other people started to surround the man. Other people told me that the level of respect I was giving this man was the level of respect given to a doctor. Nobody knew this man as a doctor before and they took it that if I was giving him that much respect, that the man must be going round pretending to be a doctor.


The people went to this mans house and he was shouting at me for showing him too much respect. They stabbed his son and one of the people then said ""if you are getting the same level and respect as a doctor then you must prove to everyone that you are an actual doctor"" and the man did his best to save his boy but the boy died. The garbage man cried and I had no idea what to say to him. I ended up being in a bad mood for many days after that and I had accidentally spoken down to someone who was an actual doctor.


""Hey I'm a doctor and you are giving me the same level of respect of a garbage man. I will prove to you that I am a doctor"" he told me


The doctor got a gathering of people and stabbed his son but successfully stitched him up and saved his own son's life.


""I am a doctor so I deserve the same level of respect of a doctor, not a garbage man"" he told everyone and even though he had a license card which told everyone he was an actual doctor, he still felt the need to prove it.";16186897440
Strange Vynil;7;1;"I was going back home, I had just finished my last shift of that day of my boring job and was eager to get some well deserved free time and rest.

To get to my home I always had to walk through a certain street that didn't have alot of people. It was the usual dark, quiet, almost empty street, which usually only had one or two people selling used things. That night was no different as I saw a old man carrying some goods, very obviously trying to sell them. Normally I wouldn't really bother with that kind of shady people, but one of the things he was carrying caught my attention. It was an old vinyl disc. Vinyl disc had always been a passion of mine.

The old man seemed to notice my attention ""Hey there, would you like to buy something?"" he asked, his voice was a deep cracking tone.

I was hesitant to answer, for a few seconds that is before finnaly answering ""Yes actually, I'd like to buy that disc."" I said while pointing at the vynil disc.

The man gave me a weird look ""Oh that, you can take it from free."" he answered smirking a bit.

I was a bit weirded out by that, but I was too tired to question it so I just replied ""Oh okay, thanks.""

The man handed me the vynil disk, I thanked him again before wishing him a good night and went on my way to my house.

When I finally got home I put the vynil disc on my old vynil record player. I was expecting some song to start, but instead what I heard was someone talking, it sounded like a computer text to speech voice. 

""Say a name.""

I waited for it continue, but it was just silence afterwards for a few minutes. 

""Anne"" I finnaly said one of my coworkers names jokingly. 

""Understood, loading"" 

I was deeply confused. 

After a bit the voice came back one last time ""Procedure completed successfully."" 

I was got the disc out. I was tired and somewhat annoyed for wasting time on whatever that was, I went to bed and fell asleep. 

The next day I won't to work like usual, but couldn't help but notice something, Anne wasn't there.";16186972940
Seriously not sure what to do.;34;3;"It started last night.

I was on my couch watching TV when I hear this loud bang on my window from outside. I jumped a mile or so as I looked up to witness the second bang. More like a heavy *thunk*, really. Then a third and a fourth and just a bunch of times. 

And. It was a bird. Flying repeatedly into the glass. Frankly it seemed like it was being thrown. I stared, horrified, as I shrunk back into my couch.

Finally, one last bang much louder than the previous ones, and the bird dropped. After maybe 10 minutes, I slow scootched down cushions to peer outside, see if there was anything hanging out throwing birds.

Nothing. 

I crept to the door, opening up cautiously, listening, and stepped outdoors looking for the bird. As I stood I felt what was logically a breeze flow through my legs, but it felt more...solid... enough that I looked to see if my cat had slipped through but there was nothing.

I scanned outside a bit more until I saw a mangled creature on the daffodils. Its beak all smashed in, wings hanging by threads. It was looking right at me, the porchlight shining in it’s wide open eyes. It seemed like birds eyes should be so much smaller. 

Anyway, I broke my gaze by the sudden desire to be nowhere near this thing.

Once inside, I see my cat on the refrigerator staring at me. She’s long-haired, gray, and very thin - a petite girl... but seeing her perched straight up, not taking her eyes off of me? She could have knocked me over with a flinch at that point. 

But she didn't flinch. Or move at all...only adjusting her eyeballs to follow as I leaned towards the door to lock it... 

I have to admit tears came to my eyes at this point. I was so freaked out. My daughter coughing snapped me out of it, and by the time I looked back from her room my cat was gone. 

After checking my daughter, I returned to the living room to keep watch from the couch for the night, eventually falling to a shallow sleep.

That brings us to nowish. The pronounced sound of glass cracking woke me. When I looked to the source, I saw it was the jar of the candle I never blew out... a brand new 22 oz candle, burned down completely. 

I got up to check on the kiddo and. She was on her belly, facing me, with her eyes wide open. I mean WIDE open. 

Jesus they were so wide.  

“Honey?” I said voicelessly.  Practically frozen in fear I managed to repeat myself louder, suddenly so fucking afraid she was dead.  

She closed her eyes and opened them again, but a normal open. She smiled sleepily, said “Hi Mom” and fell back asleep.  

I crawled into bed with her and made this post. I am scared right now. I don’t understand this. ";16186521750
Our Land;98;5;"I’ve had my eye on a corner lot for a long time.

It seemed like the perfect location, quiet and peaceful.

Of course I had no idea how much it would cost until I started speaking with the owner.

He is a kind man. Spoke to me for hours and explained it was a premium space. Such seclusion and privacy were highly sought after. 

I explained I was needing it to move my husband in. He had asked how long we had been together and our chat about the slot of land devolved.

Leaving the man to his business I pondered the lot for the rest of the day.

The price was outrageous but I still knew it was the one I needed. 

I took a bit of the money I was going to put towards a car and met the man. 

To his credit there was no negotiation and signed the space to me and let me know it was all mine. 

It was mine and his forever.

So I return this night with my husband.

He is still bleeding from the blow to his head and silently sobbing into his gag. 

The groundskeeper told me the privacy was guaranteed and ensured no cameras. 

So I drag him to the waiting hole in the corner lot of the cemetery. 

I don’t have money for a coffin.

I find the shovel stuck in the dirt. 

With a simple smack he falls in. 

Where he will wait for me.

In our very own corner lot.";16186323240
What is it?;34;3;"At first I blamed it on my stress, but I always see it, no matter what. I've tried everything I possibly can to find out what it is, but the more I encounter it the less I want to find out. 
This thing seems to always be in my peripherals between the hours of 7:00am and 12:00pm.

This Week at Work;93;13;"I love my job, and last week reminded me exactly why. I can’t help but be positive with the warmth that April brings!

It ***started with a bang*** on Monday, when Mandy found the land mine I placed along her path to school. A nice little green MRUD, tucked away in the grass close enough for the shrapnel to go nearly all the way through. I like to be simple and direct sometimes to get a good start to the week.

Tom got ***bent out of shape*** on Tuesday as he made his way through the car shredder at the steel mill. I’m not particularly proud of this one either, all it took was a slight push. But man, the results were great!

Wendell found something that ***caught his eye*** on Wednesday - the trailer hook of his tow truck. This one tapped into my artistic side. Dragging a body for 15 minutes painted a beautiful, colourful picture on the asphalt.

Theodora ***got cold feet*** on Thursday as she ran around the meat freezer looking for an escape. There was none, of course, but that didn’t stop all 109 viewers of the livestream from watching her slowly freeze to death. Don’t you love the Internet Age?

Freddy ***followed his heart*** on Friday. He took a hit from a mini cannonball to the back at point blank range while shepherding children through the pirate ship exhibit at SkulkLand. The ball passed through him and splattered his heart on the wall, and the momentum carried his body a few more steps. Theme parks are the best!

Sarah felt ***under the weather*** on Saturday when lightning repeatedly struck the radio tower she was strapped to. The first few strikes finished her off, the rest were just bonuses. Have you ever seen someone singed like a steak? I felt like a master chef!

To cap off the week, on Sunday Scotty finally ***wrapped his head*** around a big problem in his life when his neck made impact with a memorial tree. It’s amazing what a body does when it’s propelled at highway speeds. Logistically, this one was tough to pull off. Getting the concrete barrier to pop up like that was a feat. Look at me, civil engineer par excellence!

I love my job, because I get to creatively deal with the worst of society. School shooters, abusive bosses, car thieves, snuff streamers, child predators, conspiracy radio hosts, drunk hit-and-run drivers...what a week! I can't wait to see what the future brings!";16186081280
How to please your wife.;102;11;"**Friday**

It was a hectic week, We didn't get time to talk too much, so all I wanted was to hop in the bed, relax and talk to make things work. So I made a shopping list and went to a store nearby:

* *4-packs of beer*
* *Packets of popcorns*
* *Packs of sweets*
* *Netflix Subscription (Bought Online)*

I made the bed, put her pillow on the correct side and served liquid peace in glasses. Finally, find the perfect Rom-Com for the night. Aditi was expressionless. Not that it meant something, she has been like this a long time.

She said she needs to sleep and we can plan it some other day. She tucks in, faces herself on my opposite side and sleep.

I got no sleep.

&#x200B;

**Saturday**

I had to go to the shop again. I thought everything we had was dying and I wanted to impress her. Make things right. When I asked her about it once in moments of rage, she just said I am an uninteresting guy who does a 9-5 job and made her life tasteless and adventure-less.

She said she going out with her classmates. I still hadn't lost all hope. So I made another list and off I went.

* *Candles*
* *Wine (* *Zinfandel* )
* *Strawberries*
* *Frozen Pizza (with nduja, parmesan and pickled chilli- her favourite)*
* *Aspirin*
* *Box of economy chocolates*

It was quiet when she arrived, and I was optimistic that all would work out well. But dinner had just started and Aditi couldn't take her eyes from the phone. She was giggling but not on the funny things I said but something that was up on her cellphone.

She didn't notice the setup. It was the same setup we had on our first date. Same brand wine, same chocolate. But Everything was silent, the only noise that occupied the room was the tingling noise of spoons and beeping phone. She finished her food quickly. Went to bed. Alone.

&#x200B;

**Sunday**

Now that Friday and Saturday were out of the way, It was time for the final effort. It was time to pay a visit to the hardware store. I made myself another list.

* *Shovel*
* *Black bags (heavy-duty)*
* *Cleaning solution*

I Have No Control Over This;25;3;"I have no control over this. As the Sun rose for Day 2, the oceans evaporated into nothingness. From where I was standing, Earth lost its blue. Day 4 came for the Sun and the Moon. Humanity's concept of time ended along with it. The 5th Day (should I even call it a day) was for birds and the planet's remaining ""sea creatures."" How were they even able to survive days without an ocean? Day 6 sprouted an army of behemoths and I watched them crush the world below me. They displayed no emotions, I never heard their voices, all I was able to sense was the rumbling of their feet. The shaking of the ground created by these behemoths outnoised the screams of the people. People who were a part of my life. I hoped one's safe. I needed her. From the air, there's peace in this chaos. Kinda made me wonder why God watches from the clouds. Maybe He doesn't want to get involved in the chaos but that's the results of Him giving us free will.

Am I God then? Or am I a product of free will? I wish for this mayhem to stop, but I have no control over this.

The 7th Day was arriving and I was able to see the horizon from where the Sun would've risen. In front was what I called ""untainted land"" but I noticed how more peaceful the world was behind me. So this is what a lifeless Earth looks like? A shallow ocean of dust and blood. As I watched my army step on the last remaining humans, a familiar human arrived into my lair above the clouds. I have no control over this. She saw me seated on my chair and said: ""I'm here to fulfill your destiny."" She fell to her knees and I got a taste of her tears. ""Say your last words.""

I said. ""This is good.""

Five Fingers;503;14;"Rosalie was the first.  It was a mess.  She was a prostitute well known to all of us in the precinct and with that lifestyle comes risks, so it wasn’t really a surprise to find her there with her insides outside.  I really liked her, too.  To be honest, I really like them all.  I personally think prostitution should be legal and regulated.  Places in Europe are and women are always healthy and checked out by the doctors.  The main reason I think so, however, is this:  women wouldn’t have to take as much of a risk and wouldn’t have to face what Rosalie never has to again.  I digress.  Of course her murder went unsolved like so many others.  One thing stuck with me, though.  Her index finger was missing.  Soon, I’d moved on like the rest and other Rosalies took her place.

One year to the day, we found another.  It was the same set-up.   Juniper, another known street walker was found eviscerated with one missing finger, but this time, it was the middle.  It made me immediately think of Rosalie.  When the specialists checked the area they found one odd piece of evidence:  a single fingerprint from Rosalie’s right index finger.  I thought about this for a long time, even after the case went cold.

We spread the word on the street and let the ladies know that they should stay inside on this particular day and keep themselves safe.  Regardless of this, over the next three years Jaime, Taylor and Diamond were found gutted.  Rosalie and Juniper’s finger prints were found at Jaime’s crime scene and she was missing her thumb.  Her thumb print was then found on Taylor, who was missing her pinkie.  Diamond was missing her ring finger and all the other women’s finger prints were there.  We couldn’t quite grasp why this killer did this or how.  Was he keeping the fingers on ice and only bringing them out when he killed?

He’d stumped us for years and time kept marching on.  The year was almost up.  That’s when I received a phone call from a buddy of mine at another station.

“You’ve been working that case where the guy keeps cutting the victim’s fingers off, right?” he asked.

“Yeah, sure,” I said.

“Welp...you better get over here and take a look at this guy we just brought in.”

“Why? What’s up?”

“Just...just get down here.  You gotta see this for yourself.”

When I got there, my buddy met me and gave me this look.  He brought me over to the window outside the interrogation room and told me to look inside.

At first I didn’t see anything special, just a regular guy.  Then, something caught my eye:  his right hand was scarred heavily at each joint and each of his fingers seemed different from the other.

My buddy said, “When we printed him, we found your girls. He said he did it so they would always have to serve him unwillingly.”";16185626690
Notes from the Exorcism of Sarah Pinocchio;2431;202;"**Day 1**

Sarah Pinocchio had a weird fucking surname, and she was also possessed by a demon. Her mother reached out to me after her daughter had done the old 360 headspin (a fairly sure sign of demonic possession), thus I packed my shit and hustled it out to 66.6 Fletcher St. post-haste. 

“She looks a bit pale, yeah,” I noted, staring at the young girl. “Vitamin deficiency possibly.”

“But she’s hovering mid-air!” the mother yelled.

“Mhm, mhm,” I nodded. “Valid point.”

An initial test showed signs of a Stage 3 Demonic Possession. Those fuckers are rare, let me tell ya. I knew the poor thing would die if I attempted a full-on exorcism, so I chilled out for a bit, and read her some bible verses, occasionally sprinkling her with some holy water.

“Jesus, um, compels you,” I mutter idly.

“I’LL FUCK YOUR DEAD GRANDMA TO SHREDS,” the demon shrieks.

“Well that’s uncalled for,” I sigh.

&#x200B;

**Day 3**

The mother is on my case like a leech to an eyeball. Jesus lady, just let me do my job, will ya? I’ve done this shit for decades, but Karen over here has seen the *movies*. The. Movies.

“Aren’t you supposed to force the demon out?”

“Lady, you don’t want to force those lads to do anything,” I respond.

&#x200B;

**Day 4**

The Demon is getting frisky. The Child is shedding skin like she’s a big old anaconda, and the pulsating black veins underneath remind me of chocolate-glazed strawberries for some reason.

“Leave the Child alone, will ya?” I ask of the Dark Presence.

“FUCK YOU AND YOUR DEAD GRANDMA!” 

“Man, what’s your beef with my grandma?” I ask.

&#x200B;

**Day 5**

The Demon is starting to rear its ugly head. Every once in a while Sarah’s eyes pops out of their sockets, and these disgusting fucking maggoty appendages squirms out of them. Not sure what that’s all about. Pretty fucking weird. I awkwardly push them back in with a pencil, and place the eyes back gently.

&#x200B;

**Day 6**

Karen is fed up with me. Says she’ll call the police. Really, lady? The police? They don’t have the best track record with shit they don’t understand, do they?

“Look, Karen,” I say. “Give it a day or two, and I’ll have this shit sorted.”

“My name’s Melinda,” she snarls. “And you better be telling the truth.”

&#x200B;

**Day 7**

The Demon is ripe for The Poppening. You can tell by the way the veins swell with black fluid, and also by the manner in which it murders the mother, Karen. I mean Melinda. I had to close my eyes, but the sounds alone was enough to make me upchuck my lunch.

“We done here?” I ask the demon.

“Thank you, Black Father Thomas,” the demon booms. “For keeping the Child alive whilst I grew.”

“Anytime,” I shrug. “Let the Big Boss know, will ya?”

“Your Family remains Safe from the Đł₴₵ⱠØ₴Ɇ₦ł₦₲.”

“Much appreciado!”

“Except your fucking grandma.”

The Spirit of Radio;62;3;"I’ve been stuck in this room for so long I’m starting to forget what the sun looks like. I’m surrounded by stacks of boxes and old, rotting furniture. Occasionally, the floorboards above my head groan, then dust rains down from above. I’ve mostly gotten used to the musty smell.

A crooked bookcase is pressed against one of the walls. Each evening, Father reaches toward its highest shelf, flicks a dial, then a radio bristles with life. The slight crackle makes it feel so *intimate*. So cozy and peaceful. It invokes a real feeling of safety; an intoxicating rush of hope; a sense of excitement for the future.

In those wonderful moments, it’s easy to forget the horrors happening beyond the rickety ladder in the corner.

Then, inevitably, Father leans over and flicks the dial again. Silence fills the room, and I lay in quiet sorrow, drifting towards another restless sleep.

With the morning comes renewed excitement. The day moves on until afternoon, then evening. Excitement becomes anticipation as Father switches the radio on once again.

I lean forward, eyes wide and ears open, as it bears a gift beyond price: it tells me that outside, the tide is turning. Father says we may even get to go home soon. I allow myself to imagine a summer breeze kiss my face and the aroma of a floral bloom.

When Father switches off the radio, the celebration of blue and orange and yellow lingers in my imagination. I fall asleep with a smile upon my lips.

The next day, I can hardly sit still. There’s no telling what wonders the radio will offer up tonight—the possibilities are endless. Minutes stretch towards hours until, at last, Father reaches out. Excited, I shift my weight from one foot to the other.

From above, there comes the thud of heavy footsteps. Father pulls me in close and holds me tight. I feel a lump in my throat and discomfort in my chest. It’s like being trapped in free fall.

I hear muffled yells, then screams, then a bolt sliding back. A moment later, the hatch at the top of the ladder swings open.

I raise both hands to shield my eyes from the light. A tall man with cruel features climbs down the steps. He is wearing a black uniform, and his armband contains a swastika symbol.

More men climb into the room. Two of them separate Father and me while a third tips the bookcase over. The radio crashes against the ground and breaks apart, exposing a jumble of wires and twisted metal. My heart sinks.

It’s funny—I always knew were listening to the invisible flow of electromagnetic waves, but I preferred pretending it was magic. When I listened to the radio, I had a reason to persevere. I had hope in the face of despair, and strength in the face of adversity.

Now, I have nothing.";16185964630
Has Reuniting With Friends Been Awkward For Anyone Else?;24;5;"My first dose of vaccine was supposed to bring me up to 80 percent protection at the end of the month, but it was close enough and I hadn't seen my friends for so long. The conversation mired in the banal: new jobs, new apartments, podcasts, TV, the one friend who’s a father now (who we hadn't even bothered inviting), Borotaria, and how much we were looking forward to going to a movie theater. Any pause and they’d return to arguing about the best restaurants or commending Borotaria again, until I just shut down. 

I left on a whim and an excuse, and walked home feeling dissatisfied. It hadn’t felt like old friends getting back together. Instead, it felt like the village we had built between us burnt down, and here we all were, a bunch of naked strangers in a field, staring at each other. Has anybody else been struggling with your friends feeling a little… off?

But they’re still my friends, so we met up again, this time to drink whiskey around a picnic blanket. My friends didn’t show any indication they had felt as unsatisfied by our first meet-up as I did. Instead, they acted like an old intimacy had returned between them, which made me wonder if they had met up without me in the interim. I tried to force the conversation into some part of the deep end where I could swim, and launched into soul-exposing questions about how they felt about their lives and what they thought I should do about my unemployment and how much I resented the thought of giving an employer that level of control over my life again. But I couldn’t draw them out with questions or confessions, because they kept returning to politics and the best tactics for securing the oceanic biomass for Borotaria. So I feigned interest. I asked them if the biomass was krill (which made them laugh), and asked them questions about the symbiopsychobiome they kept talking about. They finally paid me a little attention, and Alex even said she might be able to get me a job.

I kept telling myself that it was only a matter of finding the right rhythm. Soon enough, my friends would be friends again. But when we invited the new father out a week after, I despaired. It was so horrible. He told us about how well his new job is going and showed me a video of his baby trying avocado for the first time. But every time I tried to tell him about Borotaria, or our plans to wrest the symbiopsychobiome from humanity, the new father kept changing the topic. We even told him we could help him find a job working with us on the biofront, or massaging the flagella, but he seemed completely uninterested. 

I’m guessing many of you have felt the same awkwardness. It’s going to take a little adapting, but I think we’ll get used to life with each other.";16186150160
Woman;20;4;"I walked down the driveway, past the Porsche Carrera. The garage opened and I removed the keys from my pocket. The lights of the van flickered; I entered the driver's side. The night took over, and yet there was much life left in it yet. As I'd soon discover. 

The roads were dead - how I liked them. I knew the hotspots and - more importantly - where to avoid. Police didn't inspect the roads I travelled down. I examined the streets. My head began to race, as I searched for someone that looked like her. Finding anyone out at this time was a stretch in itself, but one that had the same traits as *my wife*...Well, not easy.

My mind drifted. I'd been driving for almost an hour.

Checking my rear-view.

A woman crossing the road. I squint and see her face beneath the streetlight.

Smiling, I tell myself, ""I've found her.""

I stopped alongside her. ""Hey,"" I said, ""can you fix my satnav for me?""

""Uh--I must be going...""

She was strong. Almost escaped my grip. After some tussling she was locked in the passenger's side.

""Who the fuck are you? Let me go!""

""Follow my instructions and you'll be fine. Promise. It won't take long.""

""Where are you taking me?""

""Somewhere quiet.""

She opened the glovebox. A bundle of notes.

""Shut that!"" I snapped.

We stopped at my private little spot. Half a mile inside a wood with tall slim trees and many brown leaves. A long straight road.

""I'm going to open the door now. If you try and run there will be consequences.""

""OK..."" she whimpered.

""You're still thinking about running, aren't you?""

""Yes.""

""Then don't. I won't open the door until you stop. Say when you're ready.""

""Right,"" she exhaled, ""I think I'm ready.""

""It will only take as long as you allow it to.""

I grabbed the wedding dress from the backseat and unlocked the car. 

""Put this on. It's my wife's."" 

She saw blood on the sleeve.

""Don't panic,"" I muttered. ""Put it on, please.""

""How long will this--""

""No longer than one minute if you stop asking questions.""

She abided. I got my camera out. I looked through the viewfinder. Very faintly I could see her face.

The camera flashed.

I checked the screen.

She was smiling perfectly.

""Excellent!"" I said, impressed, ""just one more then we're done.""

She was a beautiful woman, of that I was sure.

""Twenty seconds and you'll be on your way,"" I added. ""Hey, those notes you saw...They'll be yours...""

She leant against a tree. *Wonderful*. I'd never seen a woman so elegant.

I looked through the viewfinder again.

She was gone.

""*Wait*..."" 

I moved the camera away from my face.

Silence.

I couldn't believe it. The wedding dress was on the ground.

Nobody anywhere.

I grabbed the dress.

Raced to my car.

Started the engine.

Her voice called at me from the foliage.

I drove as fast as I could, screaming to myself.

Never again! *Never again*!";16186037230
That night;24;3;"Mr. Brown looked at me and sighed. '*Again*, Malorie?'

I looked at the floor uncomfortably, my fists clenched.

'What are you in for?' he said, taking off his glasses and gesturing for me to sit.

'I didn't do my homework,' I said, avoiding eye contact. 'Mrs. Barrett said this is my fourth time this week.'

Mr. Brown looked right into my eyes. I could see his disappointment.

'Malorie,' he said slowly, 'I know it's hard for you. But you can't skip homework. It's important.'

I didn't know where this was heading. I stood silent, staring at him.

'I'm sorry, Malorie, but I have no choice but to call your parents.'

I looked at him in horror as he sighed, looking at me with pity.

'N-no, Mr. Brown, please,' I said. I could feel the tears coming.

'Now, now, Malorie,' he said, the phone on his ear. 'You are responsible for this. I have no choice but to do this.'

After 5 minutes, my mother picked up. Mr. Brown told her everything, about how I didn't do my homework, about how I forgot my books, and about how many detentions I've gotten this week.

I could hear my mother crying on the other end. She sounded angry. Very angry.

After ending the call, Mr. Brown told me I could leave.

I dreaded going home that day. I could already imagine what kind of punishment my mother would come up with. And worse, I'd have to tell my father.

When I finally got home, I stood in front of the door, breathing heavily. I slowly opened the creaking door, and stepped in.

I didn't say 'Mom, I'm home!' like I usually do, because I just wanted go to my room and stay there.

My mother came flying down the stairs when the door closed. She stood before me, angrily sniffing.

'Malorie!' she yelled, as I took off my shoes. 'Malorie, I can't believe you! Are you serious?! Oh God, what has my daughter become?'

I just looked at her. She smacked me and lectured me, then sent me up to my bedroom.

I lay on my bed, sulking. I wanted to run away.

Later that night, when I heard my father's car pull up, I got up from my bed and hid in the closet.

As I sat down quietly, I felt something sharp brush behind me. 

I heard my mother and father talking, then my father's angry yells, then his footsteps coming up the stairs to my room.

I silently sat in the closet, praying that he wouldn't find me.

My prayers have been answered. 

My father didn't see me, and I breathed with relief. He opened the door to the closet, but somehow just didn't see me, sitting right in the corner. I guess it's because I was hidden behind some stacks of clothes.

Then, I don't know why, my father and mother started crying, arguing, then called the police. Did they really think I ran away?

The police came into our house, asked them everything and then searched the entire house. They opened the closet, moved the clothes and gasped.

They picked me up but I stayed were I was.

Then they called an ambulance, and well, I was taken away. But I stayed in the closet.";16185957840
Horrors!;66;15;"I was sat in my garage at my mum's old dining room table, just relaxing as one does, having a beer and a bowl. My gaze wandered idly around, looking at all the various boxes and pieces of furniture I'd be moving come this June. This house had become too much and I'd be renting a much smaller apartment. In a much better town.

Something without memories. Someplace where I didn't experience things other people classified as crazy. Impossible. 

My bladder started aching and I stood up to step outside and have a piss. It was quiet, the trees above me merely bearing witness instead of rustling with the wind's indignation. I breathed deeply, appreciating the damp fecund air.

I came back inside and went back to my seat at the table. Glancing at the mirror propped on the roll up doors, my eyes slid across the white blur on the left side. Next to the mirror was a dresser with several glass pieces on it from my mother's estate. This was her property, but I was eager to leave it behind.

I heard a dog bark and after hitting the bowl, I looked over at the window facing the street. There was nothing to see, just the dark alley outside, just a dull glow of moonlight tonight. Still no wind. I took a long swallow of my Bud. The cold bite of the alcohol soothed me.

Once the REO Speedwagon song ended on my phone I reached over to grab it, my gaze once again sliding over the mirror. That white blur was still there and I let my eyes focus on what resolved into a face.

There was something under the table I was sat at, something grinning and still. My eyes met its in the mirror and as I watched, it's hand slowly curled up around my ankle.

Fuck this place, I thought, kicking that bitch in the jaw. It's hand fell away and I stomped it. Thank God I was moving away. That's the problem with this town, there's too many damn horrors. I really think they need their own damn house, yeah?";16185740840
I love kissing my girlfriend;12;9;"I love kissing my girlfriend and the main reason I love kissing my girlfriend is because I get a different vibrant taste every time I do. I prefer to just kiss my girlfriend rather than go on dates or do other romantic things. I remember the first time I had kissed my girlfriend and I tasted this wonderful putrid dead meat taste in my mouth, it was wonderful. I couldn't believe the kinds of tastes I was experiencing in my mouth it was incredible. I loved her even more for that.


Then the second time I kissed her I got the amazingly wonderful sensation of cigarettes and tobacco. It was absolutely incredible and I could feel the nicotine for the first time in my mouth and body. I wanted to keep on kissing her but my girlfriend can only kiss for short periods of times. I have never smoked in my life but after kissing her I couldn't believe how much I had enjoyed the taste of cigarettes and tobacco. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for days and I didn't mind.


The third time I had kissed my girlfriend I had gotten this amazing sensation of a rotting rat taste in my mouth and I couldn't believe how wonderful it was. My girlfriend doesn't really enjoy kissing that much and she prefers to do other things rather than kissing. It's me really that enjoys kissing more than anything else and sometimes she moves her head out of the way when I try to kiss her. I don't get angry that she doesn't want to kiss me but rather the fact that she is taking away my enjoyment of tasting vibrant and exotic flavours inside her mouth.


Then when I saw her kissing another person I wasn't angry at the fact that she was cheating on me but rather that someone else is getting the taste of putrid rotting meat or cancer causing smokes. I do miss kissing my girlfriend.";16186024400
Plotbot;132;2;"Plotbot was a girl I knew at elementary school. 


Looking back, she was almost certainly autistic, and nowadays she'd receive support, or even empathy. but back then, she was just a weirdo.


She never smiled or joined in with any schoolyard games. She never got asked any questions in class. Teachers knew to leave her alone.


Plotbot had a hobby, though. She loved to describe the storylines of every movie she'd ever seen, to anyone who'd listen.


But sometimes, nobody would; so she'd sit and summarise the storylines to herself. Out loud. In the school cafeteria.


Always in that unerring monotone buzz of her dull voice. A little too loud. She always spoke too loud.


I was a good guy, so sometimes I'd humor her. I'd take my lunch over, and sit and listen.


If I sat too close, she'd quickly shuffle over to another seat. But Storyline-wise, Plotbot didn't skip a beat. And what stories they were...


She'd always tell of savage slashings, stabbings, burnings, brutal beatings; screams and begs of people being buried alive. No details omitted.


I figured she was a huge fan of horror movies, or maybe those true-crime ""movie-of-the-week"" films.


I figured wrong.


Plotbot didn't come into class one day. Or the next. The day after, I saw her photo on the news.


She'd gone missing. Her father was arrested. Her mom had gone missing two years previously, but nobody had noticed. Or cared. The whole family were weirdos. Good folk kept away.


Police believed Plotbot's father had done a lot of bad things to a lot of missing people. Then he'd go home and tell his daughter everything, like a confessional, I guess. 


""This must be why she'd then repeat these horrible things to her friends"", the school counselor told me. ""It was her way of coping.""


Police figured that Plotbot's father had finally figured he'd told his kid too much. Felt he had to shut her up for good. Who knows? She never turned up. And that was thirty years ago. 


I saw old footage of Plotbot's father on a true-crime T.V. show tonight. Perhaps that's why everything's come flooding back. Perhaps that's why I've drank half a bottle of Jack Daniels already.


On the show, they played the police-interview video-tapes, from just before he'd ""killed himself"" in the county jail, before he could stand trial. Plotbot's father was sat spewing an endless string of evil details, in an oddly familiar, flat monotone. Slashings, stabbings. Burnings. Premature burials. No names. Only atrocities.


But then, right at the end, before the cops got angry and someone switched off the camera, he said something that hadn't made it into the newspapers, back when Plotbot had disappeared.


He started shaking and sobbing, and said ""I thought she was making that stuff up. I thought she needed help. Therapy. But then I came home and found her momma dead… my wife. My love.""


""It was worse than any horror movie, the things my daughter had done.""";16185449110
Astronaut;119;3;"A small UFO was reported orbiting the planet. Once it was discovered what exactly it was, governments tried to keep it quiet, but the information leaked. 


It was a man. Rather, an astronaut. He was floating by himself, orbiting Earth. NASA reached out to retrieve the body, but once they got close, it moved away, swimming away like a person would in the ocean. 


Investigations were unable to provide any answers. Every government denied this astronaut belonging to their respective space programs, and there was no good way to track down its origins. 


A new strategy was developed. NASA attempted to communicate with the astronaut, sending radio waves matching any and all comm systems a space explorer may have. 


“Where are you from?”


“Why are you here?”


“Do you need help?”


These questions were broadcast in every language on Earth, even the ones not associated with space programs. 


NASA was excited to receive a response, and despite the government attempting to suppress it, NASA felt it fair to allow the public to listen to the tape. 


It was screaming. Not in a man's voice, or a woman's voice, but the sound was definitely human. Analysis of the screams showed they came from terror rather than pain, although this didn’t help relieve anyone of their anxiety. 


Ultimately, a mission was created to rescue the mystery astronaut aboard the international space station, and interrogate them. 


Video footage was sent back to NASA, but this time they agreed to repress it. In time, the video was leaked. 


Astronauts tethered to the ISS left the ship, reaching out to aid the strange traveler. They had to float a considerable amount of distance; if they came too close with a ship, the astronaut would ‘swim’ away, floating through the vacuum of space as if it was mass. 


Slowly, the man floated towards the astronaut. No flags or identifiable features were on the suit. It floated motionlessly, until the man reached out to grab it. 


Looking into the face, the man was greeted by a grinning, screaming skeleton. Bones burst from the astronauts suit, stabbing into the man, puncturing his own uniform. Blood began to stain the suit, and float outside into the void. More and more bones burst from the astronaut, utterly tearing the man to shreds.   


The man's scream could not be heard through the vacuum of space, but the astronaut creatures could. It alternated between screaming and laughing. 


The other members of the ISS got out of there as quickly as possible. The astronaut swam after them for a little bit, but ultimately floated away, circling back into a strange orbit over our planet.    


Since then, no missions have been planned to leave the Earth, the people on the ISS were brought back home. 


Nobody knows where this astronaut came from, or what it’s purpose is.     


Until we figure it out, it will keep floating above us, as if guarding us from leaving our own planet.";16185421020
My friends threw a surprise birthday party. I am now on the run.;114;5;"I hate surprises. And all my friends know this by now.

Which I guess is why it urged them even more to plan it out.

Today was my birthday, and I told all my friends beforehand to not attempt to surprise me with anything. 

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy spending time with friends. But I wanted my birthday to be personal. Some time for myself. Do things I wanted to do without anyone bothering me. 

I was walking home and I was really tired. I did everything I wanted to do and now all that was left was to shower and take a nap.

As I opened my door I was immediately greeted by my friends. “Surprise!” They shouted.

But I stood in shock. And so did they.

Some looked shocked, others confused and others disgusted. Everyone just stood there, frozen.

Until Jenna started screaming and everyone snapped out of it. Some screamed, others ran out the door and some even passed out. 

I did the first thing that came to my mind. I ran out the door. I ran as fast as I could. I was confused myself. 

Why were they reacting like that? I wondered.

And then I stopped when I saw my reflection at a nearby window. I chuckled to myself.

I mean, I should probably change out of my bloody suit and let go of my annoying neighbors head.";16185413540
First Day Doldrums;16;1;"

I hope they don’t Notice.

Maybe my jawline, maybe my hips won’t swing right.

I just hope they don’t Notice.

If my teeth don’t line up right, if my Make-Up doesn’t cover The Fur.

I hope they don’t notice.

Are my hands too big? They’re hairy. I know they’re just *so fucking hairy.*

I nair, shave, and use an IPL machine.

I hope they don’t notice. 

Sometimes the Voice I use becomes the Snarl it used to be. 

Milliseconds at most, but to me, a bleak eternity revealing me for a fraud. My every grisly flaw on display to customers and coworkers alike.

Giving me away for the Monster that I am.

I hope *no one Notices.*

Shoulders back, tits out.

My mantra as I bustle and muddle through, First Day Doldrums pound in time to the heel of my boots on the tile floor.

I hope they don’t Notice.

How tight this shirt is, my oversized shoulders pressing the seams outward. At least, This is what I perceive; my cruel mind's eye playing mental Gifs over and again. 

Comical images on repeat, my shoulders tearing through my blouse and company vest, hair sprouting from every inch and orifice. My already minuscule breasts disappearing as my torso engorges revealing me for the shapeshifting full moon fueled nightmare beast I am.

Or am I? My last job ran me out and called me a Monster when they Noticed.

I take my medicine every day. It makes the smell go away, if I’m lucky it will remove any traces of The Change on my face, in my body, my movements. 

A little more practice and what was once a gruff Monsters Snarl might give way into the soft Voice I desire.

A better removal treatment will soon tame it’s Fur.

That’s why I’m here, at another new job.

Another First Day.

First Stone;12;3;"He snarled over the screen.

Aching radiated up Aidan’s thumbs, blue light baked his eyes, and stiffness seized his neck. But it had all been worth it. 

He had found it. The sin. The great noose to hang the celebrity upon. The problematic thing they had said years ago. 

Licking his lips, Aidan wrote his indignant message, attached it to the celebrity’s ancient crime, and sent it out into the ocean of social media. 

He sat back and exhaled, a satisfied sigh full of anticipation and thirst. With waiting came knowing. That others would hitch their egos to the collapse and downfall of this shining beacon of success. That his was the scream that triggered the first rocks of the coming avalanche. He wallowed in the grandiosity of feeling superior to another human being for a mistake they made long ago, something Aidan knew he would never have done, thus proving what a great person he was.

Minutes unsheathed themselves into knives slicing into his target, as countless bubbles exploded with insults and judgments. He scrolled with expanding satisfaction, feeding on the incensed nature of countless opinions ravaging a single target. Like beasts. Like a collective consciousness made rabid by the virus of his actions. 

Hours dragged into dissatisfaction, and Aidan lay to sleep feeling empty and worthless. 

He slept. 

He dreamed of countless faces glaring at him, bathed in red light, foaming at the mouth and whispering secrets he had long buried. 

He awoke to find strangers standing the foot of his bed. 

“Liar,” one said. 

“Oh, so jokes about other ethnicities are funny?” another said. 

“Crying lib-tears?” a third said. 

Before Aidan could register what was happening, they surrounded him and screamed, hurling obscenities. He reached for his phone, frantic, and found the screen cracked and slathered in blood. His accusers gesticulated and gyrated, unblinking, snarling, mad.

Aidan shot out of bed and ran out of his room. 

He found others in the living room, each of them hurling insults as soon as he emerged. Disbelief distilled into animal fear, and he backed against the wall and watched helplessly as they crowded about him, livid, their voices cracking. 

Panicked, he barreled through them and out the door of his apartment and found the hallway filled with people pointing and cursing. He ran down the stairs past rows of fevered acolytes of an outraged machine, manifested into reality to pick and pluck at his every thought, his every mistake, slaking their lusts on every second of his life. 

They knew things he had long forgotten. That he had never told a soul. 

He ran whimpering out of the building. 

He found the horde waiting, glaring at him from sidewalks, fire escapes, and atop cars. 

He froze. 

Their silence radiated with merciless anticipation. 

And then they erupted as one, eviscerating his entire being. 

He fell to the floor screaming, holding his ears shut. 

But he could not silence them.";16185672240
There's something wrong with John.;29;2;"When there is fighting to be done he fights. Until his bullets are gone. Until his knife breaks. Until his fists are bloody and broken he fights. 

But he doesn't say a word. He doesn't acknowledge orders, doesn't call back positions, doesn't warn for incoming. 

When there's no fighting he sits and stares into nothing. Occasionally, he turns his head as though following the path of something that isn't there. He eats and drinks what he's given. Shits and pisses as needed. Sleeps when he's told and rises with the rest.  

And he doesn't say a word. No please. No thank you. Not even a fuck you when someone makes a comment about his mother. 

He whimpers, sometimes, in his sleep. The only sound anyone hears from him since the incident. A raw, anguished sound. I've kicked dogs that didn't sound as heartrending as he does. 

But he doesn't say a word. Doesn't call for his mama. Doesn't plead to his god. Doesn't ask forgiveness. 

The incident should have been enough to get him sent home, but he'd been pretty much healed when we found him and our Sargent says any man who's still able to keep up is needed. And he can keep up: sometimes more than the rest of us. 

But he doesn't say a word. 

He can't.

Daddy;31;1;"When I was younger I would be scared that daddy would disappear. He promised me he would always be there, that he would always come home to me. I had no reason to doubt him. I guess I should have.

Daddy should have been home hours ago. It's around midnight now, where did he go? I'm so so scared. I wish my dad was here to hold me. To tell me everything will be alright, to tell me he is on his way back home.

I lost track of time. I don't know how long ago daddy went missing. It must have been at least one day ago. I'm getting so hungry and thirsty. I don't know how long I can survive without daddy here. I wonder if people are looking for him. I would! If only I knew the code to the door, but after 8 years, I still haven't been able to figure it out";16185449670
My dream.;1;0;"
In a one story room. Never ending. All made of glass. You can see the ground below your feet. The dirt under the glass floor. The barren emptiness surrounding the never ending stadium-like room. Through the glass walls you can see the world around you, and the solar flares heading straight for you. I was looking out towards the impossibly flat outside world, watching the dust get thrown around by the wind and the approaching solar flares. I remember feeling an overwhelming amount of dread, and I’m it feeling now while I’m typing this. Dread. Knowing I was about to die. Knowing I wasn’t surrounded by everyone I loved. Just strangers. I remember scrambling to get to my phone and typing the same message “I love you all so much. I’m going to miss you” to everyone I loved. Mum, [my cousin], [my boyfriend], [my aunty], [my other aunty], [my uncle], [my other uncle], [and my grandparents]. The flares were arriving incredibly slow. It was antagonising, just having to wait for my death that I knew was only minutes away. As it finally arrived I remember everyone in the room falling down at the same time, slowly dying as it got hotter and hotter until everything stopped and went black. I remember then waking up and slowly getting myself up off the floor, feeling confused and looking around me to see everyone else around me doing the same. I remember everything outside of the glass walls being black. No light, not plants, no dust. Just black. As if someone had put up black curtains surrounding all of the outside world. I remember the dread and the anxiety knowing everyone I loved was dead. I don’t even remember if I was dead or not. Just feeling the impending doom. Knowing and waiting for myself to die. Waiting and watching the end of the world come around slowly. Then it finally came and we all got up and it was black. I’m awake now, but I still feel the gut wrenching feeling of watching the flares coming for us. Slowly.";16186105300
The Beautiful Woman in the Yellow Sun Dress.;468;27;"I sat in my driveway, both hands still resting on the steering wheel.  Although I had been here for 30 minutes, the engine was still running at idle and the radio static buzzed through the old speakers. 

I stared at the window as the kitchen light shone through the darkness, illuminating the overgrown weeds sneaking across the crumbling sidewalk.  A shadow gently crossed in front of the window once again, a shadow I knew all too well.  She was back.  

I closed my eyes and counted to 10 before staying my mantra 10 more times, “It’s not real, she isn’t real.”  That is what my therapist had told me to do when things were bad, after the incident.

Finally, I allowed my eyes to open.  A sigh of relief escaped my mouth as the invisible ropes around my chest released their grip.  I reached into the front seat to grab for my cell as my eyes double-checked the window, but my hand found something else, something cold.  

As I turned my head those invisible ropes tightened back around my chest with a vengeance, squeezing all of the air out.  She sat in my car now, the beautiful blonde woman in the yellow sundress.  The woman that terrorized my mind.

“Do you know what day it is?”  She asked in her soft, monotone voice while she stared out the side window.

“You-you’re not rea-“ I started in a shaky voice, but she ignored me and answered her own question.

“It’s April 15th.  It’s been exactly 5 years since you took my babies away from me.”  

“It wasn’t my fault,” I said, as my hand instinctively rose to my mouth and tears gathered in the bottom of my eyes, “The stroller rolled out in front of me, I couldn’t stop.”  

“I still can’t find them, you know.  All these years, and I can’t find them.”  She spoke with sorrow in her voice, sorrow that brought the guilt from my stomach to my throat.

“I’m so sorry, but it’s not my fault.  You need to leave me alone,”  I pleaded.  Tears now flowed freely down my face, but my hands remained too shaky to wipe them off. 

“But it is your fault, you killed my babies,” she said, her gaze still fixated out the window.

“No, it’s your fault, you’re the one who let the stroller roll into the road!”  I said in a voice that was somewhere between desperate and angry.  

In only a split second her head whipped around to stare directly into my eyes, the bruises from the rope around her neck still visible.

“YOU KILLED MY BABIES!”  She shrieked.  “You could have stopped if you weren’t staring at your GODDAMNED PHONE!” 

I burst into tears as she yelled my dirty little secret.  The police had ruled it an accident, I never told anybody the entire truth.

“Since I can’t have my babies,” she whispered, “I’ll be here as long as you live.  I’ll make sure you never forget.”";16184848730
The Vanishing Basement Door;17;0;"
My sister and I loved to play hide and seek when we were kids. We had a very small house though, so we basically knew all the hiding spots like the back of our hands. I was 10 at the time, my little sister Anna was about 8 years old. It was the summer before I would be starting 4th grade, my mom and dad had just went to some dinner party. No kids allowed. That was fine by me, free reign of the house. I was in charge while they were away, but I didn't abuse that power. I hopped up from the couch and went into Anna's room, where she was playing barbies. 

""Anna, let's play hide and seek!"" I said eagerly. Her eyes widened and she grinned, ""Okay!"" She said, ""I'll hide! You try to find me!"" She practically screamed and ran out of the room. Smiling I closed my eyes and counted aloud till I got to 60. ""Ready or Not! Here I come!"" I shouted and ran out of her room. I went to the kitchen, and searched all the cabinets, that was her favorite spot. She wasn't there. I chuckled, ""She's getting good."" I said to myself and continued my search. I searched behind the couch. She wasn't there. I grunted, ""Where is that little runt."" I said, smirking. I continued searching, even outside. Our house was just one floor, so I was running out of places to look. 

That's when, I noticed a rough, beaten up wooden door. In the kitchen. I gulped. I'd never seen this door before in my entire life. We had lived here since I was a baby. Anxiously, I opened the door. It led..downstairs. Which didn't make sense. We didn't have a basement. It was dark, and the stairs creaked as I anxiously slowly maneuvered down them. When I got to the bottom, I whispered, ""Anna? Are you down here?"" There was no response. 

There was a tunnel down here, dimly lit by a light that was flickering. I started to walk down the tunnel, when I heard a blood curdling scream that sent shivers down my spine. Fear filled me as I ran back up the stairs, slamming the mysterious door behind me. I ran into my bedroom and hid under the bed too afraid to make any noise until my parents got home.

When they got home, I ran into the kitchen, and the door was gone. Bewildered, I slumped to the ground. My parents asked where Anna was. I said, I didn't know. I was too afraid to tell them about the vanishing door and the terrifying tunnel. To this day I still haven't told them. After Anna's disappearance we moved. Depression began to control my life, and I needed to tell someone my story. The guilt is unbearable. My little sister vanished down that tunnel, and her older brother didn't even protect her";16185514190
Not alone;3;6;"There was a man with a pot-belly and a pair of cut-offs.  
He followed a little girl down an alley way out back.  
I kept my distance, but I felt a shiver and scoff  
The alley was real dark, almost pitch black  
As he grabbed he shoulder  
I was gonna jump and get him  
Till she came up behind and asked me to hold her  
""That ain't me, but you'll see""  
She said, and I couldn't breathe  
The thing he touched turned right back  
And in the girl's skin, and the alley black  
It said to him ""Hear the emptiness, and fire crack  
Perhaps hear a whole lack""  
His skin split open, and his eyes went dark  
In the alley, I saw a fire spark  
Soon there were two, and then were three  
Not just him,  but also me";16185912930
Barricade;43;4;"Ryan’s shack stood in the middle of a moonlit clearing, surrounded by fog-wrapped trees.

After an hour of work, he hammered the last board across the window next to the barricaded front door. Then, he picked up the handgun, crouched by the window, and peered through a slit on the barricade.

This was how he survived. His defenses were always reliable. Sometimes, they were weakened, but he could easily repair them the next day.

​The fog thickened.

​Ghastly cries pierced the silence and sent chills down Ryan’s spine. A bead of icy sweat crawled down his nose.

They’re coming.

Dark figures emerged from the fog. Ryan couldn’t find the right words—or if the right words even existed in the first place—to describe them. The only thing that mattered was to survive until daylight.

The horrors charged. They rammed the wooden walls, shaking furniture and making Ryan’s heart pound. The air became frigid as they repeatedly slammed their shadowy forms against the shack.

*Again*.

During these attacks, a strange coldness always swept into the cabin. As it brushed Ryan's skin, he felt like he was in a graveyard at midnight.

*Until when?*

Something tapped on the floor and rolled towards him. It was a nail from the door's barricade. He pocketed it and reminded himself to hammer it tomorrow.

A loud crash came from the back window. A creature tried to wiggle into the shack from the gap on the barricade, tentacles writhed from its inky body like maggots on an eye socket. Ryan fired at the creature, sending it back outside. Seeing it tumble on the moonlit earth gave him a small sense of triumph.

*Will you hold?*

Ryan knew that he could survive this night. He got by after all these years despite being alone. Neither family nor friend came, but it was okay. It’s not like they could help him, anyway. This was his fight.

*How long?*

He closed his eyes for a few seconds and pictured those better days. But in his core lay an unquenchable particle of despair. It was what summoned these horrors and forced Ryan to isolate.

As he opened his eyes, a creature inside the shack crawled toward him.

*It’s happening tonight!*

The barricades were weakened by the continuous assault. Others tried to squeeze through the gap on the back window.

Ryan screamed as he unloaded three shots. The bullets pierced through the darkness and pinged on the floor, as if the creature was a black fog.

It was getting closer.

*Falter.*

Ryan got up, kicked the door open, and ran to the clearing; the gravely miasma invading his nostrils. The thick fog looked like a white wall that enclosed him in this nightmarish arena.

The creatures converged around him, like vultures that awaited the inevitable decay.

*​*Ryan took a deep breath.

​He raised his gun.

​*Only one way out now.*";16185175790
In My Likeness;23;10;"""Are those kids twins?"" Jeng asked after she noticed the artwork above me.

  
""No, but that's me and my guardian angel. I painted it when I was 7.""

  
""No freaking way! Didn't know you've been this good in art as a kid. You two look alike though!"" She said enthusiastically.

  
""Yeah, dad said that guardian angels look like the person they're guarding, that's why I painted him in my likeness.""  


It's been five hours already and her vomiting has been unstoppable. Her sudden scream probably woke up the neighbors.  


A bright creature hovered by the side of the door as its eyes circled around its six enlarged wings; its height almost reaching the top of the elevated ceiling. Jeng fell to her knees as the creature reach for her hand.  


""BE NOT AFRAID."" The creature said. ""I AM HERE TO GUARD YOU FROM HIM.""";16185274960
And now I’m free;2442;138;"I found my mother brutally murdered when I was fifteen years old. That’s a good ice-breaker right there. Or a really bad one. Depends who you’re talking to I suppose. Most people though will go into *obvious fake care* overdrive, with the old “Oh, I’m, um, I’m so sorry” being the most prominent comeback. “Are you OK now?” usually follows.

*Of course I’m not fucking OK, you insufferable dimwit*, is what I want to say. *Yeah*, I’ll say. *It’s fine. I’ve moved on. All healed up.*

And they’ll go “Um, so, uh, did they catch the murderer?”

*Yeah*, I’ll nod, head hung low. *It was my father.*

Man, the looks I’ll get. It’s like, they’re already pitying me you know, but now we’re delving deeper, to a yet to be discovered level of awkward sympathy that they just can’t deal with. They’ll stop talking for a bit, eyes searching for anywhere to rest but on me.

*She was mutilated*, I’ll blurt out. *Eyes missing, stabbed inwards or something, tongue split in half, intestines tied around her waist like a fucking belt. Organs lacerated and stretched out on her feet like makeshift tissue-shoes. Heart carved out, torn into pieces, scattered around her frame. Body sunken in a deep pool of blood and piss and shit. Like a corpse juice bath.*

They’ll turn pale then, dry mouths swallowing deeply, looking for any excuse to get the fuck out of there. I won’t let them. I need them to hear this. Need them to know how much I hate him.

*He took his time too*, I’ll note coldly. *Fucking tormented her for hours. Thin razor cuts all over her body, like that chinese torture method, Leng Tch’e or something. Death by a thousand cuts. Most of the mutilation was done prior to death too. Can’t imagine that pain. Impossible.*

Resignation then. They’re too deep now, they can’t just excuse themselves and leave. That’d be fucking rude. Insensitive. So they’ll sigh, and start nodding silently to everything I say, those puppy dog sympathetic eyes kinda locked on my forehead, terrified still of ever making eye contact.

And I do. I do hate him. But not for that.

I hate him for kicking me around, fucking me up every other day, hospital visits weekly, black and blue and yellow bruises all over my body, never to fully heal. Hate him for calling me worthless, stupid, ugly.

But does he deserve to die?

No. I want him to suffer for what he did. Every second of every day, suffocating on his rotting soul. I want him to grow old, real fucking old, and never know a moments peace. So no, he doesn’t deserve to die.

But she did. My mother did.

So that’s why I killed her. That’s why I made her suffer. For all those times she looked the other way. For all those times she let him abuse and torture me.

And then I framed my father for it.

And now I’m free.";16184340690
The Pods;3;0;"I am at Mamaw’s house visiting. I grew up here and it is my foundation, my home above all homes. We are in the kitchen (as always), and I hear something in the back room. I ask Mamaw what it is and she tells me not to go back there. I see the fear in her face and, though I follow her words without hesitation, I immediately feel protective and need to find out what is going on.

I walk down the hallway and open the door to the back left bedroom. There is an enormous eel/worm thing with a huge round mouth full of spiky teeth. I slam the door and run to Mamaw to find out what it is. She tells me it is a “demon” that has attached itself to Tommy, my uncle with cerebral palsy who is wheelchair bound and dependent on us for all of his needs. Mamaw explains that once it attaches itself to someone that person will die soon. I'm shaken, I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave but I need to get help.

I leave to get my sister who lives nearby. We rush back to Mamaw’s and walking across her porch is this woman with bright red hair and a scarf. It quickly becomes clear to me that she is the demon. We walk in just behind her and she softly tosses her scarf onto my aunt. The demon has clearly chosen someone else to attach herself to. Then she disappears. My aunt continues on without incident. Nothing happens for several years and we soon occupy our minds with ""normal"" life.

I enroll in college as most do at my age. I have chosen religious studies because of my previous experience. My professor is an odd sort, he has recently discovered a unusual pod, which after an incubation study determined was actually demon seed. In order for these particular demons to grow, they require water and certain earthly carbohydrates. He lectures us on his findings, but never in detail. He is often distracted and looking out over the front lawn of our building.

It rained today, and as I am walking onto campus on the lawn in front of our building I see these large brown pods start rise up from the ground. It instantly dawns on me that these are the demon seeds and the rain quickened their growth. Our professor must have planted them and was awaiting their arrival. That must explain his distraction and watchful eye over this area.

I start running towards the building because the pods have begun to explode, spreading spores everywhere. I hold my breath and run up the steps. People are just walking out of the building carrying food. They must have already inhaled the spores are bringing out food in order to feed the demon pods. Upon entering the building I see an entire banquet of food and people piling food after food onto their plates to take outside. I grab lettuce thinking it will protect me from absorbing or feeding any spores I may have inhaled. If only I were so lucky.

The people around me begin vomiting. I push my way through and run down the steps leading back outside, careful not to touch anyone vomiting. As I reach the walkway, I look around. Every person is sick. They are all on the ground.

Suddenly I become very ill and vomit.

It is too late.";16185574610
I Am A Superhero;43;6;" Half-past six in the evening. The city, breathing with life. People scurrying along the street like a pack of rats, eager to get home. The lights were now lit up, looking like Christmas had hit the streets.

But Oliver Warren, also known as Kid Wonder, knew that crime never sleeps.

He stood in his bedroom, musing. He loved how pretty the city was at night. The last of the sunlight danced down on the streets and filtered through his windows. Everything was showered with a light pink.

His thoughts were interrupted by a hissing cackle.

He grabbed his trusty cape, a red curtain, tied it around his neck, and jumped into action!

He ran downstairs and was greeted by a large shadow.

The Queen of Evil towered over him, fifty feet tall. Pink slimy tentacles oozed out below her, reaching out and whipping in all directions. She laughed again, her cackles bouncing off the walls, and one of her tentacles whipped forward to try and catch Kid Wonder around his groin.

Kid Wonder jumped away in the nick of time. Adrenaline rushed through his body. He looked around for a weapon and found a silver knife with a black, easy-grip handle, gleaming sharp.

It felt surprisingly light in his hand. Kid Wonder rushed towards his enemy and slashed one of her tentacles right off!

The Queen of Evil let out a high-pitched scream that seemed to shatter glass. Perhaps all female supervillians scream like that. It did not bother Kid Wonder though, or his super-hearing. He ran towards the Queen of Evil again and slashed and slashed, until she howled one last time and crumpled, dead, at his feet.

Kid Wonder had won!

***

The Warrens came home to a murder scene. Blood splattered the walls like ketchup stains.

They looked down to find their young daughter, her body slashed and cut all over. Blood had seeped into the carpet and stained it a dark crimson; but now it had dried up completely into a solid crust. Mr Warren gingerly placed a finger to his daughter’s neck. It wasn’t much use. She was long gone.

A silver knife came crashing down on her neck, chopping it cleanly into half. Everyone jumped.

A boy named Oliver stood over his sister’s body, a dirty red curtain twisted around his shoulders in a cape, a knife in one hand encrusted in blood, and the other hand up in a superhero pose.

“Look Mom! Look Dad!” he cried. “I have killed the Queen of Evil! I am a real superhero!”";16185121160
Early Arrival;29;8;"It's a friendship that started during youth.

Let's call him G.

We'd always have these strange adventures.

With time they got stranger, more obscure.

Eventually they became twisted.

We split the cost of a van. Waterproof paint. It looked just like an ambulance van.

The siren was easy to find too, but we rarely used it. No good bringing unnecessary attention.

Our game would be this: we would arrive at the tragic scene before the real ambulance.

How? Well we'd paid - very generously - the most corrupt bastard working at the department, to send us details when a big call came in, of an injury.

We'd only be able to execute this the once, so we told him to make it a good one.

One day when we were driving around we got a message from him. An address, some names, what had happened. We raced there in our van and stopped outside the house.

They were waiting for us on the driveway. A young man distressed, bleeding heavily from the head. Our attire was clearly convincing enough.

We introduced ourselves quick enough with false names and loaded up our stretcher. The sirens were getting closer.

""Oh,"" said the mother, ""you guys have got backup?""

""Yeah,"" I replied, unsurely, placing the young man on the stretcher. ""We'll bring him back to you in perfection condition.""

As we put him in, and closed the doors, we jumped in the front. With my window down, I heard the father say, ""Huh...Never seen an ambulance with no license plate before.""

I tell you, what a thrill that moment was.

We sped off. The sirens on our tails.

Luckily we had prepared the route.

""Am I going to be OK?""

Naturally we didn't reply.

G was smiling, though.

Our destination. We stopped the van right by the edge of the bridge.

The man was yelping in the back.

With all our muster we pushed it down and it plummeted some 200ft into the deep water. It started sinking instantly. For a moment we looked over, checking he hadn't miraculously escaped.

Then on we went.";16185160710

Without your voice I driftless roam

Bygone grottos I traverse

Memories heavy like a curse

All but your cry I am averse

Hello?

The cold abyss is swallowing

That forgotten dream I'm following

Hello?

And thorough caverns I do peer

Chasms lie, with condensation sheer

Yet I know your hail is near

Hello!?

But it's not your voice that calls

It's not your presence in these halls

And it's not your body that wetly crawls 

Oh god

It slithers stoutly from the door

Tentacles dripping with forgotten Gore

The kracken calling that I abhor

Oh no

Curves like lightning in a storm

Limbs surround, slick and warm

To my body it does conform

Oh god!

It holds me tight as I scream

And it's teeth I do see gleam

Wrapped tight in it's seabream

God no!

And and down the cold and dark I shout

Falling to its midnight grout

And to it's body I'm now devout


I follow once again...

The cold abyss is summoning

There is something wrong with me.;16;2;"There is something wrong with me.  

I can feel it in my skin. It isn’t mine, I know it isn’t. 

Sometimes I stare into the mirror and I know *that’s not my face*. 

No one knows this yet. People walk besides me on the street like I’m normal, like nothing is wrong. The people I live with, they don’t know I’m not a part of their family. My classmates talk to me like they know me. 

But I know I am an imposter. And the boy, their son, their friend is dead. 

I dream sometimes, of the night I came into this boy’s body. 

The window was open that night.  The boy was lying on his bed. Everyone else in the house was asleep. Outside, trees twisted in some strange wind under the moon.

And then a faceless man came at the window. 

I WANT EYES I WANT A NAME I WANT YOUR SKIN 

And the faceless man, crawled into the room as the boy dreamed. The silhouette blocked the  stars behind him as the faceless man drew closer to the boy’s face.  The knife in his hands came close to the boy's skin.

I WANT DREAMS I WANT SHADOWS I WANT YOUR FAMILY 

And the rest of the night was black and empty and hopeless. 

Seven nights have passed now. And those dreams, those memories come to me again. 

I am tired of my eyes. I am tired of my name. I am tired of my skin. But I don’t want to be faceless again. 
 
Maybe this is all a delusion. Maybe one day, I'll wake up. But I hope I wake up soon

Soon it will be too late. 

The door to my parent’s room is open tonight. The skinning knife is in my hands. Soon it won’t matter if those are just dreams. 

The faceless man wants something new. The faceless man is unloved and cannot love. The faceless man can only eat and eat, a black abyssal mouth always open. The room is empty and dark and I have no true shadow.

Mother, father. They are only faces for me, nothing more.  Their son's boy like face stinks on my face. 

I need to take it off. I need to take it off. I need to take it off.

I want something new. Something less than human over my faceless face.

The whole family should come together.
If I wear all their skins at once, maybe I won't be bored as soon.";16185234700
I love making sure my daughter is safe;15;4;"
My daughter is going to her friends house for a sleepover during the weekends. Her friend lives in the city center and they are both of age now that being 18 years old and I cannot help but still get such a fright when she is outside. The things that can happen within city centres like drugs, thugs and in general crime is nerve wrecking. I want my daughter to have fun and to start living her own life but I just couldn't seem to get these nervous thoughts from out of my head. I wanted my daughter to be safe while she went up to the city centre to sleep over at her friends flat.

I wanted to make sure that my daughter will be safe during her night out during the weekends and so on a Thursday I drove to the city centre by myself. I went up to a homeless man and as soon as the homeless man saw me, he was asking for money. I kept saying to him ""do you want to help me keep my daughter safe when she comes here on the weekend?"" And the homeless man looked confused but said ""ok is there money in it?"" And I stabbed him silently and whispered ""thank you because of this it will keep my daughter safe this week end""

I then went up to some drug dealer in some back alley way and he was offering me all sorts of drugs and I begged him ""do you want to help me make sure my daughter is safe this weekend"" but the drug dealer looking confused didn't care about my daughter. I shot him with a silencer and I made sure to be in the CCTV blind spots for both killings and I covered my body in black overalls. When my daughter was out with her friends in the city centre, I read on the news of police cars all over the city centre.

Knowing that there was lots of police present during the weekend that my daughter was out with her friends due to the two guys I had killed, had made me feel at ease that my daughter would be safe now within the city centre with the amount of police present. No drug dealer, thug or crazy homeless would do anything stupid with the amount of police present. I love making my daughter safe.

I can't wait to imprison her in her room again and never let her out.";16185157080
Scratch;18;3;"You’ve felt it, right? An itch, unexplainable, under the skin. It crawls, like something alive and growing.

Scratch at it, it’s okay.

You feel that fungal itch prickle your flesh, your nerves. It’s not natural, not right. Wanting to scratch it, get it out, *that’s* natural.

It feels good to scratch that itch, doesn’t it?

Your body is your own, and yours alone. Anything else living in there is wrong, aberrant, an invader. That fungal parasitic *thing* inside you right now is an affront to your self.

Ignore the blood welling up, that’s fine. Just keep scratching and you’ll feel better soon.

When you claw past the skin you won’t see a sign. They’re sneaky like that. They nibble and infect, but when you get into the flesh there’s nothing to prove they were there. You show the wound to someone and they’re worried about it getting infected, like that’s not exactly what you’re preventing.

Don’t stop now. Don’t quit.

You’re better off doing this alone, anyway. Someone fussing over the now bloody sleeves of your shirts is more problem than anything. Anything that slows you down is a liability- every second the crawling thing inside you goes further, digs deeper.  

Don’t worry if you’ve hit bone, it just means there’s nowhere for it to hide.

After a while, it might get hard to use one of your hands. It wasn’t you, it was the parasite. Focus your efforts with your one remaining hand. Scratching isn’t the word for what you’re doing any more, it’s clawing, ripping. Open new channels in your flesh, give it no respite.

It has to be in here, somewhere.

Don’t entertain the idea you’ve made a mistake, that’s not your thought. The burrowing thing is clever. It’s made its way into your skull, into your brain. It’s thinking thoughts for you.

Don’t let it win.

You have it cornered now. You just have to get it out. It will be easy, so easy, and you can rest when you’re done. The socket is your most direct route, just get rid of pesky obstruction in your way. Find a mirror, you only have one shot at this. Steel your nerve.

Waiting Room;55;1;"*Waiting rooms*

*I* hate *waiting rooms.*

Almost a song now. The start of a refrain, maybe.

I’m sure fucking in them often enough to have sung those lines a few times.

*Fucking waiting rooms.*

It’s nearly empty today, and I’ve made a wise choice. I’m here for the flu, right? A hoodie and sweats is the signature uniform. Gender neutral enough to fly under the radar, baggy enough to hide any telling features. The paper mask I’ve donned takes care of the rest.

A perfect disguise to hide my shifting form.

Honestly, they aren’t *all* bad. At my Specialists office I enter in my True Form, head high, loud and fucking proud.

This, however. This is my GP.

They’re aware of my unique situation. They don’t approve of my Specialist visits. Convinced they’re all quacks doing harm, every visit a pseudo argument on ethics and Mental Health.

If they had their way, I’d be committed.

*Waiting, in the waiting room.*

Same song, same words, new lyric. The minutes dragging by. Every one an eon filled with the same song. The single small television, clearly manufactured in a different century hangs on a sagging wall-mounted arm.

Directly over the person making the

*Fucking waiting room*

*nearly* empty.

Unavoidably, my eyes drift towards its moving colors. The bottom section consumed by Closed Captioning as a news anchor spews venomous rhetoric from muted speakers.

It doesn’t hold my attention long.

My cohort soon becomes the object of my attention. Its hand darting upwards.

*Waiting*

As it slowly draws down it’s cloth face covering, I see its eyes for the first time.

*So many eyes.*

Glittering multitudes of them meet my gaze. It’s mask continues its journey downwards.

*Waiting*

I can’t tear my eyes away. Gazing on in horror, I watch as it reveals twin fangs on either side of its mouth; chittering quietly. It gives me no reprieve from the horror, holding my eyes locked in its hypnotic gemstone stare. Ensnaring me in this waking nightmare.

*Sir? You can come back now.*

The nurse’s voice clearly startles it. Yanking up its face mask and shoving dark glasses over *those fucking eyes.*

It stands quickly and follows the nurses beckoning hand. Saving me from mutual exposure.

I guess I’m not the only thing hiding my True Form in the

One Wish;39;9;"Tears trickled down my face as I watched my mother being lowered into the ground, both sadness, and anger overtake me. I think back to the last time I ever saw her, she was a shell of her former self, fuck cancer!, I think to myself as my father was sobbing into my aunts shoulder. At least she is at peace now, no more pain, no more suffering.

The next few weeks were tough, I would find myself awaking in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, I kept having a dream that my mother was cradling me in her arms like she always did when I was little, only her breathing was heavy and wheezy, just as it was in her final moments.

I decided to go for a night time drive, in order to clear my head as best as I could, the car window was down as I enjoyed the breeze, it is soothing to me alongside the calm and still of the night.

Towards the end of my drive I noticed a hooded man on the sidewalk, he seemed to be wearing a black cloak, now normally our instincts tell us to avoid people like this, especially when it is past midnight, yet I found myself drawn to him, like a moth to a flame. I pulled my car over opposite the hooded man, and got out of my car, I approached the man, my legs seeming to move themselves towards him.

The hooded man was looking right at me, I could feel his stare within my very soul itself.

""One wish I can grant you, anything you desire, all you have to do is wish,"" the hooded man said with a powerful, and unsettling voice.

Internally I was terrified, yet there was just something about this man, or whatever it is, that just seemed off, like it did not belong in reality.

A childlike sense of wonder, and magic suddenly flowed through me like a hot knife through butter, and I found myself mouthing my wish, ""I wish my mum was still alive,"" tears were forming in my eyes at the thought of her once again.

""Granted!,"" the hooded man shouted as he vanished before my eyes.

Just like that I seemed to come out of a trance like state, and thought I must have imagined it, my head was not so straight right now. So I got back in my car and headed home.

Five days went by since my hallucination, and I decided to visit my mothers grave to put some fresh flowers down, and sit with her for a while. As I was clearing away the dead flowers, a thought came to my mind, what if it was not a hallucination, what if the hooded man was real, and he really did grant my wish?.

I started digging my dear beloved mothers grave with my bare hands until I reached her coffin, I grabbed a crowbar from my car frantically, and proceeded to pry open the lid.

I was absolutely horrified to see scratch marks on the inside of the coffin, and my mothers rotting face permanantly frozen with a look of terror!.";16184645930
The Firemen;78;9;"Yearly, the Earth is hit by about 6100 meteors, averaging out to be 7 per day. 


The space debris itself wasn’t anything unusual, just the usual little space rock caught in our gravitational pull. It fell down, landing in a little rural town in the southern United States. The rock was on fire, and kept burning, even after hitting the dirt. 


The fire never went out. It began to grow, and spread. 


The town itself was destroyed, people were trying to escape, yelling that they needed to run from the “Firemen”. 


Everyone was confused, they interviewed a few survivors, who begged everyone to stay away from the fire. 


“If you look at it, it’ll draw you in.” One man said, shaking terribly. “Even if you resist walking into it, one of those...things… will come and drag you in.”


Despite the National Guards best efforts, the fire could not be contained, and began to spread. Mostly rural towns were destroyed, but the rate it was spreading, cities and whole states would be engulfed in flames. 


More and more reports leaked. People observing pictures of the fire claimed it had a “destructive beauty” and claimed they “wanted to go become part of the flames.” Some people actually went out of their way to go see the fire in person, others willingly ran into the inferno, screaming in a weird language as they immolated themselves.


The pictures of the mentioned “Firemen” were suppressed at first, but eventually were leaked to the public by a whistleblower. They were humanoid entities made entirely of flame, and they were often pictured dragging unwilling people back into the flames with them. Video footage showed them materializing out of the flames, as if they were made situationally instead of existing as entities inside the fire. 


Two months later, most of the southeastern United States had been burned down to ash, although the fire kept raging. No matter what the government does to stop it, the fire just keeps spreading. 


Richer Americans were able to fly to different continents, poorer Americans (about 98% of the population) were checked as “low priority”, and left to fend for themselves. Canada and Mexico took in refugees, but eventually had to close their borders. The rest were left to burn, either walking willingly into the flames, or being dragged in by the Firemen. Within a year, all of North America was a blazing inferno, haunted by some type of fire that we don’t quite understand. 


Most of us thought we were safe, across the globe. Despite the heavy loss of life and the horrors we had seen, we had some hope that we could be okay, maybe even recover. 


The fire reached the oceans, and began to burn on top of the water, spreading at an even faster rate somehow. 


I’m standing on a beach in Spain, watching the heat and steam draw closer everyday. I hear my family, calling me to burn with them forever. 


I can hardly wait.

Sleep, my darling;57;2;"""No! Don't make me sleep, I don't want to! You know I hate bad dreams..."" If an uninterested bystander heard the complaints, they would have imagined a bratty child. A violent mind might have wanted to spank the infant, more tender soul would rather sing the kid to sleep. But both beings would be stunned if they discovered that Eric, a full-grown man arguing with his fiancee, was the source of so childish whines.


""You know you have to rest..."" Eric's fiancee Susan whispered in a concerned tone. She only wanted him to stop, nothing more... *Can sleep deprivation be lethal?* she conjectured as she shoved him against the bed. ""Sleep, please....""


One's willpower can be strong enough to go on without sleeping for a few days - Eric's surely wasn't. A few mumbled objections left his throat before he gave in, drifted away from smiling Susan. 


*Those are mere dreams*


A forest, a sanctuary of peace surrounded Eric at instant. Trees standing tall as mighty guardians, observing him - or rather the ground covered by conifer needles and leaves and pinecones. As if they saw through him.


*But dreams are powerful*


He felt small, insignificant. Uneasy even. What was his presence in an ancient forest good for? Why was the silence so intense? Why was he perceiving everything so clearly? He wondered, contemplated alone. And with abysmal thoughts...


*And they twist the power*


...veils of darkness slipped into the dream. Into his mind. And the trees turned hostile. Peaceful aura was no more, death and decay took over. Reigned in destruction. The leaves, now wilting, rained down around Eric, covering his bare feet. Bare feet standing on soil and pinecones and needles - metal needles, as he discovered moments before he shrieked and woke up.


He jerked upwards and sat up, all sweaty and breathing heavily. *Mere dreams...* he tried to remind himself. But he wouldn't sleep again that night, no. Poor Susan would be sad, but his mental state was too fragile - he couldn't force himself.


In the morning, Susan lazily opened her eyes and glanced to the right, where Eric was supposed to lay. He wasn't there - as she had anticipated. With a sigh, she reached under his pillow and retrieved a small satchel full of forest soil. *Can sleep deprivation be lethal?* she conjectured, a grin forming on her face. *I hope so.*";16184529080
The Last Boat Ride;24;4;"""How long have we been on this boat?"" I asked. It felt as though just yesterday that we were taking off from the port.
   ""Weeks? Months? Years? Who knows at this point? I've been doing this job for a long time and the days just sort of run together"" said the man.
   Had it really been that long? I've been on this boat this long and I still don't know his name? Let alone seen his face? 
   I looked out the bridge window. It was dark and the flood lights on deck were casting an eerie pale yellow glow in the falling snow. The sea was rough tonight and I could see the white caps just past the bow, but beyond that, nothing. 
   ""Kind of makes you feel alone ya know? The snow falling, pitch darkness all around spare the lights on deck. Don't you ever wonder what's just beyond that darkness?""
   ""I know what's beyond. I've been there many times."" he said in the voice that sounded as though his throat was a gravel pit. ""Taken many a soul through this passage and it's always the same. The snow, the sea's swell, the darkness just broken by the lights"" 
   ""Where are we going?"" I asked, even though it felt like yesterday, I had already forgot my departure point and my destination.
   ""You're lucky. Most people walk a seemingly endless wasteland flat as the eye can see. Desolate houses and towns just out of reach on the horizon. They walk it forever, losing themselves to time and Death. You got off easy being on this boat."" 
   ""What are you talking about? Who are you?"" I grew instantly uneasy.
   ""I'm the guide of this vessel, and a guide for you, but if we're to go any further, do you have any gold?""
   Remembering I woke up that morning with a gold coin over each eye, I reached in my pockets and showed them to him. ""I woke up with these over my eyes, I thought it was just a joke played on new passengers, strange that you mention it now.""
   He laughed, ""Yeah that always happens. That's your fare, it's what you owe me for this ride."" He held out his hand. It was unnaturally thin and frail, almost skeleton-esque. 
   Cautiously I placed the two gold coins in his palm just as the lights in the bridge cut out leaving nothing but the pale glow from the deck to come through the window. I looked at the man now and could see he was nothing but a skeleton head to toe. Shocked, I stared into his empty eye sockets.
   ""Thanks,"" said Death, ""welcome to the Afterlife.""";16184667920
'Just a phobia,';229;12;"The therapist stared at me. 

'Okay, let me get this straight, Noah. You think there's a *duck* in your closet?' she raised an eyebrow.

I didn't say anything. Instead, I placed my head in between my arms. 

'Noah?' she said quietly. 'Please answer?'

'It's not...' I breathed, 'quite a.. duck.'

'What do you mean?' the therapist blinked at me, comprehending what I had said. 'You just told me...'

'I know,' I said quietly. I wanted to cry.

'Noah. It's okay!' she tried to hold my hand, but I pushed her away.

'Please don't.' I said firmly.

'Noah. It's highly likely that you have a phobia called '*anatidaephobia*'. It's the fear that somehow, somewhere, a duck is watching you.'

'No, a duck isn't watching me.' I was quite sure of it.

'Alright,' the therapist sighed. 'I guess you're just tired. Stress. Listen to me.'

I looked at her, my eyes still wet with tears.

'There is no duck in your closet. Repeat with me. OK?'

'There is no duck in my closet,' I whispered. This made me cry even more.

She took off her glasses and put them on the desk. 'Don't worry. I'm always here to help you.'

That night, when I got home, I turned on all the lights. I took off my shirt and lay on my bed, staring into my closet.

I slowly walked over to it. Is it worth it? Should I open it?

My hand reached for the closet handle without my consent. It slowly turned it, and, opened it. 

There was no duck, alright. 

There was just a man, crouched over, with white, luminescent  eyes and bloody teeth, smiling from ear to ear.";16184216580

Fine, I’m gay, other women can get pregnant. My wife can, No big deal.

Maybe I don’t have The Parts.

Sure, never a real Mom.

But a Mom, just the same.

Where it could be growing without The Parts, I’ve truly no idea.

Who am I to question a miracle, right?

Skimming Stones;103;6;"“Flat stones with sharp edges, Rose. You have to use flat stones.” I instructed my daughter, as  I ran my hand through the sediment just beneath the river’s water surface and pulling out three rocks, smooth and flat.

I analyzed the setup I made across the river stream for the practice. A large tree’s branches stretched across from both sides. Thick moss hung down. I had tied the target to one of the thicker branches so it would dangle close enough to the river.

I turned to my daughter, the look in her eyes was not odd: A void. I could sense it. She shuffled in her steps and lethargically collected small stones one by one.

My heart was cracking and I clenched my fists to bite back the anger welling up in my chest and took a deep breath.

“Here” I announced to get her attention. “Watch and Learn. This the way you do it.” I held my arm out to the side at an angle and flicked it. Stone skimmed across the river. 

“1,2…” rose counted number of times the stone kissed the water. The stone flew in the air skipping the third touch, also missing the target.

“Damn it, I missed. But, you get the picture, right?” I asked.

Rose nodded, her curly blonde locks clung tight to her skull. Her eyes after a long long time shimmered with excitement as she took a stone from her collection. 

She held her arm at an angle and tossed the rock. It plopped into the water stream and sank.

“Shit,” she said, lowering her head.

“Try again.”

The second rock sank as well.

Rose held the last rock of her collection. “One more time, kiddo” I said.

She took the final rock, one a little bigger than the others.

I stepped behind her, took her elbow, and steadied her arm. “Close your eyes, my child. See the target in your mind, feel it in your soul. Remember the pain it caused to you, We don’t like pain, Do we?”

“No Dad.”

I stepped back. “Go on ahead now. Hit the target.”

Rose shut her eyes, stepped out with one foot, and flicked her wrist. The rock skimmed the water’s surface four times before striking the man dangling upside down from the overhanging tree limb. 

The man let out a yelp of pain as he swayed from side to side. Blood flowed from the wound above his eye, seeping into his brown hair.

“Nice!” I cheered.

Her eyes grew wide, a smile stretched across her young face.

“Do you want to try again?”

“Yes!” she said, clapped her scarred hands together.

I rummaged through the sediment, came back up with several smooth rocks.

“Aim for the middle of the face next time. Remember how he looked at you? Remember how he did things that hurt you, made you feel the pain?”

Rose nodded, took another rock and closed her eyes, and remembered.";16184301320
We were among the first;28;6;"I died young. Sometime in my teens - I can’t remember exactly when, only that some injury or disease messed with my head so much that I arrived in the afterlife still rattled from death.

Others joined me: more teenagers, phasing into existence in this new world. A beaming light shone from above and off the golden gates before us, the clouds below us sturdy enough to walk upon. Contrary to previous expectations, no one greeted us at the entrance.

We all moved hesitantly forward, and I eventually pushed on one of the doors to find it unlocked. I entered, wondering what angels or gods I’d come across. If my humanity would be weighed. If this ‘heaven’ was merely the between place, where all were judged for their eternal joy or pain.

I saw no cherubs. No multi-faced, winged humanoids. No beasts of any kind.

Only a little girl.

She’d been looking up at the light when I grabbed her attention. Her eyes slowly made their way towards my direction, her head following afterwards. A slight smile appeared on her lips and she made a definitive effort to blink. Her eyelids closed for several seconds before they opened once again.

“Hello?” I asked. “Are you the only one here?”

Her head cocked to the side. She started to speak, cleared her throat, then exhaled a dry whisper in response. “I have been. Always have been.”

I swallowed. “Are you… God?”

She let out a forced giggle. “Maybe. I can’t remember. I have only been.”

“You’ve been what? Did you die?”

She closed her eyes again, then glanced once more at the light overhead. “Once, perhaps. A long time ago. A very long time ago.”

Her head suddenly snapped back towards me. “But you’re here now, with me.” The skin on her face stretched back, revealing the bloodshot whites of her eyes and a gaping mouth. “You’re here, you’re here, you’re here!”

In an instant, she had bent her legs and leapt forth. She only got a few steps before falling to the ground, wisps of the clouds raising around her.

“It seems,” she sighed, struggling to push herself up with wobbling arms. “It seems I’ve forgotten.” The girl looked around, the smile immediately giving way to a sort of primal fear. She retreated back, glancing every which way. Tears began forming at the corners of her eyes.

“I can’t…” she whispered, curling up into a ball. She began to rock back and forth, muttering something over and over again.

Any fright I felt when she moved dissipated into concern. I took delicate steps towards the girl, kneeling down before her. Leaning in to hear her speak.

“I can’t remember. I can’t remember. I can’t remember,” she uttered.

“What can’t you remember?” I asked.

The girl looked past me, unable to focus properly. She shut her eyes tight and when they opened again her pupils began to waver.

“I can’t remember seeing people.”";16184495070
The wolf that came from hell;14;15;"
Ethan Woke up in a sweat, he felt something was wrong, his head was throbbing. It couldn’t have been a hangover, it just couldn’t. Ethan was only 14 and he wouldn’t dream of drinking, well if he did his mother would kill him. Slowly Ethan got out of his bed and looked in the mirror, a cold, sad, tired face met him as he glanced through it. Then he noticed something, the lighting was off putting, almost like a film you would find in the 90s. He began to notice everything was off, the usual “popcorn” ceiling as he called it wasn’t even there, every time he tried to look up he just saw a vast space of darkness. It was like the world was blocking him from seeing certain things. That’s when he heard it, a BANG from downstairs. Startled, Ethan creaked out his door, not wanting to wake his parents up he slowly went down the stairs, each one making a horrible, painful sound of old floorboards. That’s when he heard it again, BANG, it was closer this time, much closer. Too close, coming from the living room. He didn’t want to push further sweat dripping down his forehead. Then opening the living room door, he noticed how vast and empty it was, the room had no interior, walls where bare, chandeliers where gone. As Ethan explored the room he knew something was off, something was really off.

Then he saw it.

Their eyes locked, how long had it been standing there, waiting for the boy? Blood trickling down it’s mouth ruining it’s wolf like white fur. Charcoal eyes stared him down, they where a void, just like everything else. It’s human like facial features and distorted body twisted and bent. If it wasn’t standing up, holding a dead child in its arms, and missing its snout, maybe it would’ve been something representing a wolf. But this creature from hell wasn’t that, it was something else. It just watched Ethan, he was stuck there, he couldn’t breathe. Did he even need to breath? This thing had frozen time. Horrifically, it started approaching Ethan. Still smiling, it was so close the boy could smell its putrid breath, raw flesh coming from it, as it’s claws began to dig in to ethans stomach he howled, but nobody could hear Ethan. In an instant Ethan collapsed to the floor. The last thing in his view was this distorted, twisted being putting his finger up to his lips, whispering “I’ll see you soon.”

behind the shower curtain;216;17;"i awoke in the night to go to the bathroom. just had to pee, no big deal. i got up, and tip-toed across the hall to the bathroom trying to prevent the floors from creaking and shifting.

 i do not turn on the light when i go to the bathroom at night, the only light to guide me is the small blue light of the thermostat. i sat down on the cold toilet seat rubbing my groggy eyes, i wasn't fully awake but i was sure as hell awake enough to see him. 

his one eye was visible from where i was sitting, peering out over the side of the shower curtain as the shadow of his tall figure cast on the wall. 

*why the fuck is dad in the shower?* i thought to myself, realizing shortly after that my father was not nearly as tall as the man two feet away from me.

i squinted my eyes tight, trying to get a closer look at the man behind the curtain when the ruffle of the fabric made a sound that made the hair on my neck immediately rise. 

and then his eye was gone.

i blinked a few times trying to decipher what had just happened. was i dreaming? was it all just a trick of the light? 

i was getting up to go back to my room when i saw it.

his head was exposed over the top of the curtain and he had the biggest eyes i have ever seen. they were now all white, almost luminescent. his smile was so wide as if it was touching each eye from both ends. he was stretching his long and skinny neck closer and closer to me until we were face to face.

we sat there for a while, neither of us blinking. tears streamed down my face and i prayed to God that someone else would wake up and save me. he was so close to me i felt his breath on my skin. his eyes did not move and that fucking smile did not go away. 

and when i finally did blink,

he was gone. 

it was just me in the bathroom. 

so i ripped my pants back up my legs, and ran back to my bedroom as i felt vomit in my throat. from my bedroom door, i took one last look at the bathroom,

and i saw an arm wave goodbye from behind the shower curtain.";16184008830
The Old Ways;2653;172;"When I was a wee fucker, maybe four or five, I used to wake up in the middle of the night with my mum standing over me with an axe. At first you know I didn’t even see her, just the white of her eyes and the reflection from the axe. Fucking scared me though, tell you that much.

I’d drift off to sleep again, cuz she’d tell me, “Harry,” she’d say, “Just go back to sleep, alright?” And you know, she was my mum, and you’re supposed to listen to your parents and all that, so I just drifted back to the old land of Nod. Sometimes though I’d have nightmares about her, vivid fucking dreams of her swinging the axe right in between my eyes, splitting my skull perfectly down the middle. 

Anyway, after a while my twin brother, Henry, would wake up too, but unlike me he’d scream and throw tantrums. Mum wouldn’t flinch though, just stood there making shushing sounds with a finger on her lips until Henry shut the fuck up. “Henry,” she’d say. “Shut the fuck up.” The fear in his eyes though, always got to me.

On the night she split his skull perfectly down the middle I didn’t even wake up. Slept through it like a baby, waking up bright and early staring into his lifeless eyes - now on seperate parts of the bed. Tell you the truth, I don’t remember much after that. Well, that’s not true I guess; I distinctly remember the sight of his brain, seamlessly sliced in half. I slipped around in his blood for a bit, until I tumbled down the stairs, knocking myself unconscious.

Didn’t wake up for a month. Induced coma. Swollen brain or some such.

They locked my mum away of course. Still rotting away in the loony bin somewhere, drinking her own piss or whatever crazy shit she’s up to these days. I only talked to her once after I woke up, and it was the weirdest fucking conversation in my life.

“It’s the Old Ways,” she muttered, mucusy spit dripping down her dry-cracked lips. “When One becomes Two, you have to split it in Three. Just gotta pick one, and hope for the best.”

“Fuck you, you old hag,” was my parting words to her. 

And you know, I never understood it. Not until I had you, Fergus. Unlike my mum though, I’m telling you everything upfront. I don’t know why it happens, or fucking how it happens, some family curse or something maybe, but that thing over there...that thing you call Finn...he’s not your brother. We only ever had you, Fergus. We don’t know where he came from.

“But dad,” Fergus whispered. “I’m not Fergus. I’m Finn.”

“Strange that,” I said. “I used to forget which one I was too.”

“So how can you tell? How can you be sure?”

“It’s like my mum said,” I shrugged, raising the axe. 

“Just gotta pick one and hope for the best.”";16183476560
I trusted the doll;284;16;"When I was on an overnight business trip, our four-year-old daughter, Kayla, went missing when my wife, Michelle, fell asleep on the couch. I flew home, but by the time I arrived, almost twenty-four hours had passed. Two weeks later and we still had no clue what happened to our sweet girl. One night, as Michelle and I dreamt of a happier time that no longer existed, I felt a tap on my forehead and woke up.

Kayla’s favorite doll stood on my chest and pressed its plastic hand against my head, as I jolted up. The baby doll fell to the ground, but slowly climbed back to its feet and waved its hand at me, motioning me to follow it. Like a Claymation scene come to life, the doll tiptoed out of the bedroom and into our upstairs hallway, as I followed it in a daze, half-awake. 

After rubbing away the sand from my eyes, I noticed the doll’s left hand was extended out to the side, as if it were holding an invisible person’s hand. The doll approached the railing, twisted its head towards me for a second, and then flung itself over, crashing down on the hardwood floor in the living room.

Intrigued by this bewildering display, I walked downstairs to investigate, and just as I reached for the doll, it jumped up and stepped onwards towards the basement. I followed it into our unfinished basement. The doll leaned against the fieldstone wall and pointed a finger to one of the stones. I grabbed the stone, and a horrifying wave of fear washed through me when the stone snapped off, revealing a hole behind the wall. I picked up a flashlight nearby and poked the light around in the hole. And then I saw it. A pile of bones. A small skull.

I looked down and the doll’s arms were wrapped around my leg, hugging me. As the tears flowed, I carried the doll back to our bedroom and set it gently down next to Michelle.

“Was it her? Did she kill our Kayla?” I whispered. 

The doll nodded. I sat down on the bed near Michelle and shook her awake.

“How could you? How could you kill our girl?” I shouted.

“I told you I never wanted kids, but you kept insisting that I would warm up to being a Mom.”

“You’re a monster. You threw Kayla over the railing and burned her body. I’m calling the cops. You’re sick!”

The doll gripped my hand firmly, and as I stared into its eyes, I felt as if it was requesting my permission to take out Michelle.

“She’s all yours.”

The doll jumped on Michelle and stuffed its plastic head into Michelle’s mouth, as Michelle removed the body from the head, but was unable to extract the head. Michelle choked to death on her own saliva.

Kayla may no longer be alive, but I can feel her presence. She’s with me.";16183888080

Urban Legend: The Apparition of the Girl's Head;17;2;"A disembodied head floating in the woods, seen by hikers in multiple parts of North America. Witnesses have reported a few different physical appearances, though it is mostly seen as the head of a little girl or a baby. A few things are common among sightings:


1. The head silently floats along forest paths several feet above the ground, at about an average human running speed.  
2. The head does not speak to or interact with anybody. The mouth is closed, the expression is blank, and the eyes are fixed forward in a stare.   
3. The head cannot be followed. Some have tried, but the head inevitably is lost as it passes behind a tree or around a corner, apparently vanishing.  
4. Sightings are *always* followed by misfortune. How soon afterward varies, as does the scale. Events that follow can range from the loss of an important item, to the loss of a loved one, to the death of the witness. 

Much is unknown about this legend. Some speculate that the apparition is the spirit of a child visiting the location of her death. Nobody knows for sure whether the head causes subsequent tragedies or appears as a warning. There is some debate over if appearances in dreams are indicative of unfortunate events in waking.";16184362110
out of body;9;0;"

Showering At The Gym;17;11;"There’s nothing worse than showering at the gym. Old dudes staring at themselves in the mirrors. Chatting to each other with their junk hanging in plain sight. Definitely not an ideal place to catch up on current events. 

The geyser back home had packed up, meaning that, after my daily sessions in the gym, I had to shower there. 

It’s weird but, since I started showering at the gym, he’s been doing it too. We’ve never exchanged more than the shyly spoken “hey, how’s it going?” as we walk past each other in the locker room.

We barely talk. So, I don’t understand why this wrinkly old man moves my clothes, steals the towel off the door and hides my things in his locker. Oh well. He’s probably a lonely guy, or I remind him of his kid or something. It’s harmless, so I let it slide.

Thursday rolled around. I made my way to the locker room to shower as usual, and of course, Old Man is in the change rooms. No towel around his waist and a creepy smile on his face. I pass a fake smile and head to my locker. I open it and it’s empty. I look back at Oldie, he’s snickering and laughing to himself. I looked around and found my bag under the bench. I picked it up, placed it back in the locker and headed for the shower. Warm water is a blessing. I stood under the stream and let it wash over me.

The old man’s snickering started up in the shower next to me, the annoyance returned. I closed my eyes to wash my hair, the snickers stopped. Then, I heard something pop, quite a foreign sound.

I quickly rinsed my hair and looked down. A stream of blood flowed from the stall next to mine, merging with the water at my feet.

Rushing out of the shower, I began banging on the door of the stall housing the Old Man. With no one but me in the locker room, I had to get to him. The door seemed to be made of steel, it was impenetrable. Hopefully, the banging would attract someone to come and help. The door swung open, the Old Man was within.

His shaving razor lay beside him, being washed clean by the stream of sanctimonious water. His creepy smile, beaming up at me. He seemed to have a second smile, his neck cut from ear to ear.

The blood flowed gently down his chest, coating his white hairs and giving them a red hue. His throat was disgusting. The gaping slit pulsated, as the blood drained from him.

I reached over to turn off the water in the shower. The Old Man reached up from the floor and grabbed my towel, pulling it off and leaving me exposed. Confusion, shock, horror and surprisingly embarrassment washed over me.

“Haha!” He exclaimed.

“Got you again!”";16184307980
Robot Ashes;12;2;"I kept my mother in an urn. Daily I would look at the mantelpiece where she rested.

Then I saw an advert popup on my computer. I clicked on it.

*With ground-breaking technology, we can transform those ashes into a fully functioning robot*. *It will be able to communicate with you, do tasks, and activities. It will be able to teach you things. The image of your deceased will naturally be recreated through the process. That's right, we can bring back your beloved!*

For a few days, I gave it some thought. After seeing it, the ashes on the mantelpiece felt unsatisfactory.

How could I refuse the opportunity?

One week later they delivered her in a large van. She was wrapped in a large box, which took some time to cut open. It was just like her. Incredible.

She left the box on her own and checked herself in the middle, then addressed me: ""How have you been, honey?""

""I've been good,"" I replied. ""But now I'm better!""

\*

I don't know what they did to mother, but something isn't right. She barely rests. When I try to sleep she starts hoovering. When I invite her to walk with me she ignores me.

""What's wrong, mother?"" I asked.

Her voice cracked, then become strangely high-pitched. After a while every time she tried to speak it sounded like distorted guitar.

So, I figured I would tend to some of the housework for her. I did some gardening one evening. As I watered down a few flowers, I turned to see her standing by the patio doors with a large knife in her hand.

She pushed open the door and stood there, her posture perfectly straight, and stared at me without emotion. Then she rushed towards me. She shrieked. Her speed was unfathomable. I tried to climb the fence, but she dug the knife into the middle of my back. As I fell into the flowers, she effortlessly lifted me over her shoulder.

I was carried to her car where a coffin waited for me.

""Wh--where are we--"" I gasped, coughing blood. She dropped me in and closed the lid. As the car started I tried to force my way out.

I'm fucking done for, I told myself. The pain in my back was unbearable. I couldn't move. I daren't move.

The car moved like a steam train, and the coffin rattled against the sides of the boot.

Finally the car came to a stop. Silence loomed. Then I heard the boot unclick.

I tried to scream. ""Wh--where!...are!...""

She didn't open the lid.

""You must know by now, honey,"" she replied plainly. ""We're at the crematorium.""";16184272620
Vacation's End;27;5;"Randy sighed contentedly as he took in the view of his bucolic hometown through the panoramic bay window in his living room, unspoiled by skyscrapers. Leaning back in his postmodern lounge chair, he put his hands behind his head and smiled.

The end of most vacations was bittersweet, but this one was different. Two weeks in the wilderness, in a sylvan forest well off the beaten path. Some minor foraging for food, and meditation. *Lots* of meditation. It had been the perfect location...more peerless than he expected.

Nothing unusual heralded the theophany. But he abruptly found himself caught up in a divine presence, with prophesies of leading multitudes to a better life. It all began now. His mind reveled with the possibilities.

A loud explosion at his front door shattered his reverie. Tentatively, he crept towards the stairway. A hand on his shoulder startled him; he whirled around. Looming over him was a tall stranger, serene but fierce, like Jesus dressed as Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. Randy was too surprised to move. The stranger shoved something into his hand. ""Defend the stairway,"" he intoned plaintively. ""I'll take up the rear."" Randy stared at the 45 caliber pistol in his hand. ""But who--"" He looked up to find the stranger gone.

Loud bootsteps pounded downstairs. Randy raised the pistol, padded to the stairway's top landing, and spun to aim downwards. A commando, dressed head to toe in black, raced upwards. Randy fired first; the bullet's impact sent the intruder cartwheeling. Another soldier raised his firearm, then collapsed; Randy spotted the stranger withdraw. Between them, they managed to kill three more intruders.

Several radios burst forth with static. ""Something's wrong! This isn't what was supposed to happen! Abort! Abort!"" Heavy footsteps egressed from multiple exits. Randy shot one more escapee from his front door, as another fell to an upstairs volley. Then, quiet.

Randy bolted upstairs to find the stranger towering over a mortally wounded trespasser. Randy grabbed the foe by the collar. ""Who are you?!"" The sound of clenched teeth and shattering glass, followed by foaming at the mouth. Cyanide. The invader would tell no tales.

Randy gaped at the stranger. ""Who *were* they? Who are *you*?""

The stranger smiled grimly. ""They saw you coming. They have technology that lets them see probable futures. You're a threat to their power. Victory is yours today, but they will try again. The battle before you is long and arduous, and victory is not assured, but it *must* be fought. As for me..."" He tipped his hat up; luminous eyes transfixed Randy instantly. ""...I will help when I can. Just know that you are not alone.""

Randy protested. ""But I'm just an everyday guy with an average life!""

The stranger smiled solemnly. ""Not any more.""

Randy looked down at his gun. When he looked up, the stranger was gone.

He shuffled through his living room and gazed out of his bay windows at the tranquil city. But the view seemed completely different.";16184026050
Souvenir;63;6;"All Henrik could recall was the purple lightning followed by two long arms pulling him upwards.

Then he was naked in a triangular room, hands and feet welded to each end of a crucifix-like structure standing in the centre.

He was surrounded by an audience of spindly, crooked figures with featureless trapezoid-shaped heads. Two lengthy, fingered appendages rippled up and down the sides of their body.

""Keltuyimeq,"" He heard a voice shout. ""As tradition demands, I am speaking to you in the language of the world I have just returned from. As always, I have brought back a souvenir.""

Henrik looked in the direction of the orator. It was pointing at him. He started to protest and the orator stopped.

""Excuse me,"" It said and glided over to Henrik. One appendage stretched to force his mouth open. With the other, it reached in and brutally pulled out his tongue.

Henrik nearly fainted with the shock. His mouth filled with blood and he started to choke. The orator placed a tube in Henrik's mouth to suck up the blood.

""I apologise,"" The orator said, throwing the tongue towards his audience. ""Oddly, they communicate with this. Have a look and then please pass it to the next Keltuyi beside you.""

Henrik hung listening, phasing between the pain and the surreality of his situation. These things didn't care if he was suffering. He wondered where he was. Why was he brought here? What are these 'Keltuyi?""

For hours the figures examined him and asked the orator countless questions. Henrik was pulled, prodded and butchered. Small pieces of his body were sliced off by the figures. He would convulse in terror at each of their cuts. They spoke excitedly about adding his flesh to their collections.

Henrik was bloodied, flayed and pathetic. His eyes, his lips all gone. Fingers and toes all taken. Only one ear remained.

""What are those?"" Henrik heard one of them ask. What are what? He thought.

Then he felt something grasp his testicles firmly. Henrik shook his head, hoping they would understand his plea.

The orator replied challengingly. ""Do you want them? Here, try and take them.""

Henrik felt the appendage leave his groin and another replace it. He felt it sharply tug. His abdomen twisted in the jolt.

Then another harsh pull. And another.

""I have found them quite stubborn to remove,"" The orator said. ""Here, let me try.""

Henrik started to pray that this was just a bad reaction to his new drug regime; they warned of night terrors. Wake up. Please.

The orator gripped Henrik's scrotum and yanked with such force that Henrik's body nearly came away from the crucifix. He heard a translated mixture of laughter and disgust as the blood poured out from beneath his legs and splattered on the floor.

The orator went up to Henrik and sliced open his belly. Henrik vomited.

""Come!"" The orator shouted. ""There's more.""

Ear Infection;120;10;"“Yup, the ear canal is swollen. I’ll prescribe you some antibiotics and ear drops.” 


I groaned. I woke up at four in the morning with my ear pounding, and rushed to the ER. My first sleepy thought  was that I slept on it wrong, but after a cup of coffee I started to worry enough to get it checked out. 


I drove back home, called into work for the next day, and downed the massive amoxicillin pill they gave me. 


My ear started to itch, and I had to force myself to resist the urge to itch it with a q-tip. Suddenly, I remembered the ear drops the doctor had given me. I tilted my head down, and dispensed four drops into my ear, laying down on the couch to make sure they went as deep into the ear as possible. 


I felt a gush of air, as if my ears had popped, and the dropper fluid rushed out of my ear. 


Confused, I got up and dropped in some more, before laying back down. I monitored my breathing, making sure that there was no pressure change in my sinuses. 


Despite the effort, my ears popped again, and the fluid rushed out my ear once more.  


Pissed, I got up for a third time, dropped in twice the amount prescribed, and layed back down, this time pressing a finger on the outside of my ear to keep any fluid from escaping. 


Sure enough, I felt the pressure again, but this time the fluid was trapped. I felt it bouncing around, trying it’s best to escape. 


Maybe the infection was just causing weird pressure differences, I thought, wondering why it was becoming harder and harder to hold my ear down. 


My head exploded in a migraine, unlike anything I’ve experienced before. I wrapped both my hands on the top of my head, as if to keep it from physically bursting. Dizziness took over, and I leaned over to vomit, feeling the familiar pressure of air coming out my ear. 


I groaned as I felt a large hunk of something escape my ear canal. Disgusting, I thought, assuming it was just a big bundle of wax, collected from fighting the infection. 


Then it started wiggling. 


I rushed to the mirror, seeing a hairy, spider-like appendage sticking out of my ear, wiggling around like a man trying to swat a pesky fly. 


I yelled, and the appendage sank back inside my ear, causing a disgusting feeling, like the most dry wet willy anyone had ever experienced. 


“KNOCK IT OFF, YOU FUCKING TWAT.” A voice rang from inside my head, causing a second migraine to start up. 


I stared in the mirror for a few minutes, wondering if I was going crazy. I took a second dose of amoxicillin, and laid back on the couch, trying to ignore the itching and wiggling inside my ear. ";16183631440
Dating app;156;12;"How does a lonely 33 years old male with receding hairline and sinking self-confidence find a date for himself?

Apparently not through Tinder, Bumble or a billion other dating apps that are out there. You swipe and you swipe in hopes of finding the one who inexplicably falls for you and brings joy in your miserable life. But you don't find her. Instead you find more rejection and never ending disappointment. This had been the story of my life for past one year. 

I had more or less given up on my dating life when my sister, Linda, sent me a link to some new dating app which some acquaintance of her, had made a few months back. Linda cares for me. She had even tried to set me up with her friends but none had low enough standards. 

So, I decided to try out this app. I had nothing to lose anyway. I downloaded the app and setup the account. It didn't seem anything special, although the profiles were good.  

I was relentlessly right swiping when I got the call from Linda. 

""Hey, Delete that app immediately and delete your profile first.""

""Wait, what?? Why? What's wrong?""

""Something is wrong with the app.""

""What do you mean?""

""I saw a few profiles of people who I knew were dead. So, then onwards for every profile, I googled and looked into public records. And for majority of the profiles I could find something hinting that they are dead.""

Now that I thought about it, I recalled I also had seen Hannah's profile while swiping, she was my friend who had died in a terrible car accident. 

""What does that mean? Is it some kind of scam?""

""Maybe. I don't know. I am more afraid of the other possibility.""

I had just cut the call and then I got a notification. It was from the dating app. 

""You've got a new match!!"" It said. 

I opened the app. There was a message from Hannah. 

""Hey, Neddy.""

I froze in my place.

A Swing in the Park;55;9;"*Faster! Higher! Weeeeeeeeeeeee!*

I pushed as hard as I could, but it wasn’t enough. It was never enough. Not in the last 10 years have I heard “that’s great” or “good job”. I’m covered in sweat, and the sun isn’t helping.

My foot slips, sending me stumbling forward mid-push. I manage to catch myself before it’s too late, thankfully. It’s getting harder. My back is in knots, a result of time, stress, and exertion taking its toll. Don’t believe the hype, kids - 50 is not the new 40.

*What happened, daddy? Faster! Faster!*

I grit my teeth and push again. And again. And again.

The park was fairly empty at first. Just a few people scattered around. That made it much easier to have some space to work with. But now there are dozens of people, and I don’t know how I can get out without bumping into someone. I hate crowds.

*Weeeeeeeeeeeeee!*

My heart is racing. I need to stop and get out of here soon. She was right, I shouldn’t have gone out again so quickly. I should have slowed down. Now I’m stuck and in pain with no exit strategy. Good job, idiot.

I can only hope things will work out.

A blood-curdling scream cuts through the serenity. All heads turn instinctively to the source of the sound. A woman cups her mouth and nose, crying, screaming about a body in the bushes through panicked gasps.

I get distracted and forget to push. The swing stops. A small head turns a smaller pair of eyes until they make contact with my own. Butterflies? Yeah right. A hundred-pound brick manifests and drops in my stomach.

This is a situation someone like me never wants to find themselves in. What do I say? What do I do? What’s the right move? They don’t exactly give you an instruction manual for this kind of thing. Adrenaline pumps and panic overtakes me. The spiral is broken by four words from the little person sitting in a swing in front of me.

*You’re not my daddy!*

Ms. _____;77;5;"Ms. \_\_\_\_\_ was as old as the town itself. No one dared ask her what her name was, but the children—cruel as only children can be—called her Withered Wendy. Her house was a favorite target for wayward stones.

It was difficult to catch more than a glimpse of her. Sometimes she would emerge to water the white flowers on her front porch, but she never seemed to step past the boundaries of her property, at least not during the day.

There were rumors about her, of course. Every possible rumor, ranging from the disgusting to the bizarre, had been applied to her. Some said that she came out at night to hunt down little children to make into a stew. Others claimed she wasn’t even fully human.

One bored hot summer day, four curious fifth grade boys with nothing better to do decided to investigate. Mustering all their courage, they walked up the steps to Ms. \_\_\_\_\_’s porch. After a fierce whispered argument, one of the boys stepped forward and knocked on the door. The four children held their breath in anticipation.

Ms. \_\_\_\_\_ opened the door, and a smile spread across her face. Perhaps she didn’t realize that these were the same boys that broke her window a week ago. Or perhaps she didn’t care.

She motioned for them to come in, and after a shared apprehensive look, they shuffled into the room. The door locked behind them with a noticeable *click*.

Timothy, who never learned to keep his mouth shut, was struggling to stay silent. After a few more seconds of quiet, his curiosity overpowered his caution. He was only a fifth grader, after all.

The question popped out. “Is it true that you go out at night to hunt little children like us to eat?” He asked.

The old woman grinned (but it looked more like a leer) and laughed (but it sounded more like choking).

“Why would I need to go outside when you are already here?”";16183571630
They think I'm some kind of monster.;84;4;"They think I'm some kind of monster.

It's getting ridiculous. I see them whispering, I can even hear their words every now and again. ""The crazy lady"". ""The bad nurse"". ""That monster"". Then, whoever spoke looks around and spots me. I just smile. They lower their heads, try and look innocent. A woman even started to cry once.

And no wonder she did, the poor thing had no one else in the world. This happens with some of the people here in the nursing home, it's easy to identify them after a while. No visitors on Christmas, no one in on their birthday. They always tell a similar story, too. How there's a son who's picking them up next week or so... but next week never comes.

Those are the best ones. You have to spot them, but once you do, you get to be *creative*.

Like with the outfits! Oh, I do love the outfits! Old Mr. Morales for instance, he was afraid of dogs, everyone knew that. It took me two months and a big chunk of my paycheck to make a wolf costume. I showed up to his room at night when everyone was in bed. Stucked a cloth in his mouth, being careful not to kill the old chap, and laid the severed head of a hound right over him. The way. He. Squirmed, oh my! To make me leave, I made him scratch his own chest like a doggy with those filthy overgrown nails.

That is key. They have to do it to themselves.

Then there was old Mrs. Macklin... that poor woman. She only ever talked about two things: her love of baking and her severe joint pains. I showed up to her room one night with an old bag of flour on my head... and nothing more. Can you imagine the look on her face? Mrs. Macklin used to tell people her knees hurt so much she couldn't stand up for two straight minutes. But she stood for over half an hour in front of me that night, the old liar. Seemed in pretty bad shape the next day, though.

Ah yes, then they whisper at each other and say I'm crazy, but *I'm not*. I'm the least crazy person there. Because eventually, they gather the courage. They tell someone, one of the younger caretakers usually. And what they get in return? A sympathetic smile. ""A wolf suit, you say?"", ""A bag of flour, you say?"". The caretaker comes up to me, full of good intentions: ""Mrs. Macklin needs a review in her medicines. She seems to be *imagining things*.""";16183498110

You took my life and buried my body deep within the pines, where not a soul would ever find me.

Though blood stopped flowing through my veins long ago I am kept aware by my undying hatred for you, waiting restlessly below the soil while my corpse slowly rots.

Blackened trees tear at your bare skin as we return to my grave. My rotten teeth rip your flesh and fill your veins with disease. Your howls of agony echoing in the still night are a sweet melody to my ears.

Life has just left your eyes as I tear your tender heart from you, feasting under the pale moonlight.

Late at night;90;1;"Raising a child by yourself as a young mother is quite hard, you see.

Working from home doesn't make it easier, having a toddler when you're still in your mid twenties just makes things worse. Although we rarely struggle with money, I still had to move us to a small cramped apartment in order for us to live a comfortable life until things got better.

Me and my son share the same room, you see? He has his own bed and I have mine, but he still insists on sleeping with me every night. He's so educated and well behaved, I couldn't possibly refuse.

It would actually make me happy when I finished my work for the day, I would put my mac book away and go to sleep, only to find him there smiling and turning during sleep. It reminded me that all that hard work had meaning.

Tonight was no different.

The only thing that changed was that I had finished work early and quickly went to bed before him. He was already wearing his pajamas and had eaten dinner, but I decided to let him watch some cartoons before going to bed, he was so young and already knew how to turn off the TV and get into bed.

I barely layed down on the mattress and I dozed off.

I woke up suddenly to the sound of knocking, I looked over and saw my son fast asleep besides me. I was still groggy so it took me a while to realize that the knocking sound was coming from the front door. I froze.

Someone was at my door so late? But why? Then it dawned one me, and I became terrified, sweating and trembling. I reached under the bed and got a kitchen knife I had kept just in case this happened again, I had to protect my son.

Slowly, I left the room and I opened the door. There was a young man, he apologized for bothering me so late at night, then he explained that he was part of a search party looking for a young boy who had been missing for a few months. The child went missing after going into the nearby woods.

After showing me pictures of the boy I told him I could help, then, invited him in. I got out of the way while hiding the knife behind my back, he went in, and I carefully closed the door behind us. I have to do this, he saw my face.

In the Pines;128;15;"Father's funeral was three days ago. I decided to clear out his little forest cabin today.

The night forest welcomes me. Dark, endless sea of pines swallow up my dim headlights like an abyss. Wind and loose rain gently snuff out my cigarette - they will not tolerate my bad habits. Rustling of the pine needles echo through the tall branches in roiling waves of green. I heard wings softly flutter above my car.

Father always loved the forest. The last few years of his life robbed him of sight in his left eye, so he marveled at the forest with his right. He seemed to sit under the trees till the lines on his face grew deep and intertwining as the bark, and moss climbed up the side of his body.

It was so still, so quiet. The moon's heart beats gently above me. Faint mutters of an owl almost lull me to sleep.

Soft cushion of leaves absorb all sounds and my thoughts. Comforting cold creeps into my car.

*Darkness shatters.*

Weak beams of light break at the silhouette of the eerie creature. I swerve to avoid it and crash headfirst into a tree. A cacophony of panicked birds, broken branches and alerts screeching.

My heart still pounds in sync with the blinking emergency lights as I lay my eyes upon the creature.

A large buck stares back at me. Its massive antlers branch into the darkness of the forest, weighed heavy by leaves and vines. Its coat is an immutable, translucent white. I dare not breathe in its presence.

It melts into the darkness of the night, hooves never disturbing a single pine needle on the ground.

I sigh and pull out my phone, hoping help would come quickly.

When my car is finally fixed up again, I made it to the cabin before nightfall.

My nostalgia and reminiscence turn to panic as I discover dried, muddy bootprints and broken glass.

Someone had broken into my father's cabin few nights ago. Judging by the few missing antique possessions, their intents were clear.

Had I not swerved to avoid that deer, I would've stumbled right into these visitors. I thank the fates for my survival.

Another detail nags me at the back of my mind. A minuscule one. Humans are apt at making empty connections, they say. My thoughts could be much the same.

It was blind in its left eye.";16183182440
Magic Tricks for Tragic Chicks;163;10;"As soon as I started working late, and catching the night train home, I started to see that same ""Magician"", as I called him, time and time again.


His shtick was pure cornball: He'd approach a young female passenger, and propose to show her a trick, with a deck of cards or a bouncy-ball or whatever, and his trick always started sorta dumb but ended up amazing. He seemed to have a remarkable talent. 


He'd read minds, he'd see around corners, he'd pull chains straight apart. And sometimes, very very late, on the very last train, he'd persuade a young lady to leave with him. He'd edge ever closer, all the time, gazing deep into her eyes and gently touching her arms, her cheek, her neck. They were in the hands of a master.


He had that effortlessly handsome look that you can't quite describe. It's almost… every face, at once. Everything to everyone. And never, in nearly six months, did he approach me to show me a trick. Maybe I've got every face all-at-once, too. Only mine's like the crowd, the throng, the Hoi-polloi. Bland, forgettable.


What was odd was that once this magician had cast his entrancing spell upon someone, they seemed to fall into a sort of daze, as if dumbstruck. And then the magician's tone would stay the same, but his words would change. He'd say the most disgusting, misogynistic things to these women. And they'd giggle and sigh with delight, every time. I heard him say the strange words ""Magic tricks for tragic chicks!"" and ""Abracadabra, I'm gonna nab ya!"" All with eyes shining bright, and smiles wider than Iowa.


And I'd see these women get off the train at the next stop, and I'd wonder just what would happen next. 


Until one quiet night, no-one would bite. One-by-one, the few passengers left, until there was nobody left in the carriage except the ""magician"", myself, and a strange lady I'd not noticed before. She wore sunglasses under a wide-brimmed hat, with a thick black wool-coat turned up over her mouth. Her skin was practically translucent. And she was watching me watch her.


The ""magician"" stood still, his eyes meeting mine yet somehow seeing nothing. ""Isn't this your stop, dear?"" He spat, angrily, as the train slowed. I stood up, and both the magician, and their assistant, made for the door, too. But I jumped back aboard, leaving them both muttering identical curses on the platform, as the doors shut and the train sped away.


Frightened, I got off at the next stop, and took a taxi home. I never saw the magician, or their assistant, on the train again. Or any of the young ladies who'd been taken to their fate. But that night when I rode the taxicab home, I thought I caught a glimpse of the magician, down a dark alley. She was packing her assistant neatly away inside a zip-up travelling case, like a folding bicycle, his limbs bending in unimaginable ways.";16183126650
Baby Piñata;1605;101;"It was Maddies birthday. Seven years old. Seemed like only yesterday she was puking all over me, whilst I was desperately trying to fit half a ton of laundry into the washing machine, juggling her and the detergent around like I was a circus clown.

We weren’t really planning for a Maddie 2.0, but then Wilhelmina came along six years later, and there I was again; juggling a baby and a cake around, anxiously trying not to get the vomit anywhere near the icing, but failing the task miserably. A few drops here and there probably wouldn’t kill anybody.

Maddie didn’t really take to being a big sister quite like we’d hoped. Sibling rivalry I guess. Maybe a feeling of neglect? She’d get over it though, I was sure of it.

And some days, she absolutely did. She played with little Mina, made funny kissy faces at her, carried her around like a doll (even though she wasn’t allowed to), and genuinely seemed to adore her.

But there were also bad days. Days when she yelled at her, ignored her, even hit her. Not hard, mind you. Just gentle slaps. But it scared me, and it scared me even more how angry I’d get. You feel guilty for even thinking it, you know. Hurting your children.

I never did it though. Came very, very close.

So there I was, tired, sweaty, filthy, carrying little Mina around like a football, setting plates, lighting candles, getting everything ready, while my good-for-nothing-but-also-wonderful-husband was entertaining the little demons outside.

“I can watch Mina for you,” Maddie’s cheery voice suddenly called.

“Uh, fuuu-dge, yeah, could you sweetie?”

“Sure!” she chirped, carefully lifting Mina out of my football-grip. “I’ll show her all the decorations outside! And the baby piñata!”

She smiled, skipping outside playfully whilst babbling incomprehensibly to Mina, leaving me to suffer the warzone that was my kitchen.

I was so out of it you know, so I didn’t really catch it. Not until it was too late. We didn’t have a *baby* piñata. We had a piñata, sure. A llama one. No one in their right mind would swing at a *baby* piñata. A llama, on the other hand...

I caught a glimpse of them swinging at it while I was doing the dishes. Laughter and joyful cheers barely audible over the sound of our neighbor trying to get his lawnmower started.

Maddie skipped into the kitchen, whistling a merry tune.

“I’m hungry, mom. Can we eat soon?”

“M-Maddie,” I stammered. “Where’s Mina. What did you do to Mina.”

The lawnmower started, and someone hit the llama with a forceful swing.

“I tucked her away,” Maddie said.

Discordant sounds as the lawnmower struggled to gain momentum. Wild screams permeating the air, bestial, harrowing shrieks.

“You, uh, you didn’t,” I murmured, a horrid realisation entering my mind. “You didn’t put her in the piñata, did you?”

Maddie threw her head back and laughed heartily. “No, silly,” she said.

“I hid her under Mr. Mortimer’s lawnmower.”";16182554770
Click;121;6;"I stifled a yawn for the fifth time as my heavy eyes focused on the horror movie on TV. 

Mom sat next to me on the sofa as we watched how a group of teenagers were picked off one by one by a psychopath, all in glorious monochrome. This was our tradition every Sunday night. I always hoped that the movie was long so that I could stay up late and somehow delay the inevitable school day tomorrow. 

A loud clang outside made my heart pound. It was our gate. I knew what followed.

The front door swung open, and dad stepped into the living room. He passed by the TV with half-opened eyes. Something bulged at the back pocket of his pants, covered by his soaked white shirt. He paid us no mind as he walked towards the stairs, but then he stopped by the wall where his collection of replica weapons and tanks were displayed on a cabinet. 

He looked at me. Both of our heavy eyes locked. His brows furrowed as he then turned to the stairs and climbed up to the bedroom.  It was a silent order. *It’s late. Go to bed*.

Mom focused on the movie. She knew what it meant, and she dared not protest. Not tonight, anyway. They'll likely talk tomorrow when I’m at school. I hope.

I lumbered up to my bedroom and sank to the bed. From the open door I saw dad sitting on the chair in front of his desk. 

He pulled out the bulge from his back pocket and worked on it. I was too sleepy to notice what it was. Whatever it was, it reflected the light from the desk lamp with a silver glint. It was a bit long, with some parts of brown near dad’s hand. He then took out three small cylinders from his pocket. They had a faint golden hue. Probably a new replica that he’ll assemble tonight then show me tomorrow during breakfast.

*Click*.

*Click.*

*Click*.

My eyes were sinking. Dad is right. I should get some sleep now. I have to wake up at 5 in the morning to prepare for school.

Something hard pressed against my temple. It's just dad who's about to say goodnight, like he always does.

House Rules;186;15;"People think the rules I tell them are foolish. As someone who has lived in the area for years, I don’t think so.

I told my friend Jack that: “They can see the light at night. Don’t leave it on.” When I woke up, the light wasn’t working, and neither was Jacks heart.

I told my friend Mary: “Don’t sit on an empty chair unless I brought it here when I moved.” I turned for only a few seconds, but when I looked back, I only saw her bottom half.

I told my friend Sarah: “If you notice someone is staring into the window, don’t stare back.” I found her without eyes in the next few hours.

I told my friend Mikey: “Don’t open the door after 10PM. Even if they say they are the police. They aren’t.” He went missing that night.

I told my friend Lia: “If something falls behind the furniture, don’t bother. It’s gone.” Her hand was chopped off while she reached for her ring. We aren’t friends anymore.

I told my friend Luke: “If the fan starts on its own, don’t touch it. Somethings already inside and you need to ignore it.” The remains of his limbs were caught in my fan.

I always tell people the same things.

Why do none of them listen?

It’s only a matter of time before they hurt me too.";16182915790
Peace was Never an Option;127;22;"I remain hiding under a pile of cold cadavers long after the mayhem ends, shivering in silence as the echoes of agonized screams replay in my mind.

I gather the courage to crawl out, slick with blood, and more horror greets me as innards hang across the twisted branches like grisly webs, the brittle foliage whispering of the unspeakable slaughter it had witnessed.

My eyes scan the gruesome scene in disbelief, my empty stomach wringing and my beleaguered heart stuttering. Chaotic streaks of white lay amidst the mutilation. Fallen feathers not of the killed, but of the killers.

The air is heavy with iron and irony.

Our symbols of peace turned against everything they stood for.

Turned against everything *we thought* they stood for.

A flutter punctuates the ominous atmosphere.

I turn with dread.";16182964010
The Boy in the Mirror;80;11;" (Societal Pressure)

&#x200B;

I can see him watching me.

When I pass mirrors.

He’s been following me since I was a little girl.

The Boy in the Mirror. Too long.

Too close.

I do my hair, Make-Up, everything in the bay window facing the tall hedges around my backyard.

The glass is special, highly reflective.

He can only show up in Mirrors.

You have to have Mirrors, too. If you don’t, people think you’re fucking *batshit*. 

Maybe I am, after all. I’m a grown woman and,

My reflection is a boy.

The Boy in the Mirror.

&#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~

&#x200B;

I don’t mean he appears in the Mirror, no. He doesn't stand beside me, nor behind me.

You misunderstand. He takes my place in it.

He moves like me, his hair appears as mine, clothes too. Shadow on the jaw on the rare occasion I miss a shave. The Make-Up I wear. His face still that of a Boy Child.

Just as it has for nearly thirty years now.

The Boy is always smiling now. 

Always. Fucking. Smiling. A twisted pained smile. 

A sneer at the Woman who stole his place. 

He never ages, The Boy, though my window shows the passing years on my face. One that once may have shown The Mans face to match The Boy. 

One that now never will.

He haunts me, the spirit of a child I killed when I was but a child myself. Murdered in cold blood, and self preservation.

A fellow victim of a world that demanded his existence. An existence neither The Boy nor I could allow.  An existence cut short, because I took his Place.

&#x200B;

Now, his ghost is my greatest suffering.

&#x200B;

We used to feel like friends, twin spirits separated by panes of glass. Sharers of suffering.

As I grew, he didn’t. Though we continued to look the similar, I began  to look older.

&#x200B;

He began to look angry, though he just kept *fucking* smiling.

&#x200B;

Maybe because he felt left behind.

Maybe because I was living his life under his Name, without him. At least, I was for a while.

I’ve given him back at least that, taken a Name of my own. Even if I can never give him a body.

There was never one truly his to have. Not really.

Why am I afraid of The Boy in the Mirror? Why do I fear the ghost of a life that never was?

A life *rightfully mine?*

Last week I saw him from the corner of my eye

A Sweet Melody;47;9;"My wife and I live in the country. Far from anybody else. We live in a small cabin my parents had built years ago. It was nice and quiet. Just the way we liked it. Every night we would sit on the porch, staring into the woods, looking at the stars, and listening to the sounds of nature. 

One night my wife said as we sat on the porch watching the night pass by. ""Do you hear that humming?"" I looked up at her, ""Yes, I love when the animals of the forest sing to us."" I said soothingly. She shook her head. ""No..This is different. It's a person, humming a sweet tune."" She said, standing up and walking to the edge of the porch. 

I chuckled, we had been drinking tonight, I imagine she had too many and was hearing things. I shook my head. ""I think it's time for bed my love."" I said as I guided her back into our home and into the bedroom. I turned the light off and laid down next to her. I fell asleep almost instantly. At 3:05 A.M. I woke up, to an empty bed. I imagined my wife had gotten up to use the toilet. So I just went back to sleep. 

At 8:00 A.M. I woke up, and my wife still was nowhere to be seen. It was odd. I usually was the first to wake up and I'd usually cook her breakfast. I got up and searched the house. She was nowhere to be found. I was starting to panic at this point. 

I called the authorities, who said they couldn't do anything for 2 days. Apparently a person has to be gone 2 days to even be considered a missing person. I called my wives sister, who said ""No I haven't heard from her!"" Her mother said the same thing. 

As night approached I sat on the porch and my mind wondered to our conversation the night before. ""Do you hear that humming?"" She had said, and at that moment. I heard it. I heard it loud and clear. Calling to me. What a sweet melody it was. I followed the humming. I followed it blindly. I followed the humming, because that's where my wife would be";16183150770
Monster;11;2;"Do you know what it's like to wake up from a terrible nightmare? You sit up bolt straight in your bed, trembling hands clasping the duvet, soaking the fabric with sweat. Your heart seems to take up your entire being, you feel the erratic beat reverberating through every bone in your body. Your teeth feel almost fuzzy, there isn't any other way to describe it. You sit there, eyes wide open in the darkness, buzzing from head to toe with pure, instinctual, fear. Perhaps even a whimper escapes your mouth. But you can’t move, your mind prevents it. It races at a hundred miles an hour.

Is that really the shadow of a chair? Or is it some monster summoned from the depths of hell, ready to tear you limb from limb? Is that the shuffle of a footstep you hear? No, no. Your mind shuns the idea. It’s just the house, you know how it creaks. Is that the steadiness of breath that is not your own? Your ears must be playing tricks. And so you sit there, eyes straining to see through the thick night, and you feel as if something’s directly behind you. Its gaze feels as though it's burning into the back of your skull. You want to turn your head, you want to look. But, what will you see if you do? Your mind is at war with itself. Your breath begins to get faster and faster, brain struggling to comprehend anything…

And suddenly, a light flickers on, soft arms wrap around you, a soothing voice coos in your ear, you breathe in the familiar sweet scent of your mother, the scent you can never describe but it reminds you of sugar cookies and summer days. You feel warm and protected. You know you are safe. Wrong, you THINK you are safe.

Her sweet scent becomes sickly, making your head spin and your muscles weak. The once smooth and honey-like voice now grates like jagged glass. Her arms tighten like a vice around your ribs, and you can’t. Get. Free. Because, what if your mother is the unnamed thing in the dark. What if your mother is the monster?

And now you wonder if you ever did wake up from the nightmare.";16183404480
The man;13;2;"The filthy man sat just next to me. I breathed heavily, staring out the window.

He tapped me on the shoulder and as I turned around, smiled crookedly.

''Yes?'' I said quietly, staring at him.

''Can we please switch seats?'' he asked, tilting his head. His voice was squeaky but his accent was thick.

''What for?'' I rubbed my arm where he'd touched me. 

''I want to look out the window,'' he replied, hopeful. ''Please, sir?''

I thought about it. Firstly, did I really want to sit in the spot that this filthy, dirty and most probably homeless man had sat? Secondly, did I want to give my opportunity to look out the window to a stranger?

I shook my head. Why am I being so unkind? This man was probably poor, his first time flying in a plane.

''Of course,'' I said hesitantly. 

The man smiled at me as his eyes glinted. ''Thank you, sir.''

''You don't need to call me sir,'' I laughed, ''I'm not your boss or anything.''

We quickly switched seats as the flight attendant glared. 

The man immediately strapped his seat and looked out the window, as I rubbed the seat with some paper towels. It was dirty.

I sighed and stared ahead. 

Then an announcement came above me. I listened carefully.

*''Due to an overwhelming amount of passengers and weight in the plane, we'll have to drop off one of the passengers, unfortunately. Seat 13, Row B, please get ready.''*

My heart dropped as I looked above myself and found that I was being dropped.";16183303510
Jaunt;39;5;"Sarah needs me.

I can’t feel my legs, but I’m getting out of here. I have to.

I see her, outside, dancing in the fading light.

Sarah is five. I mean she will be tomorrow. She’s so beautiful when she laughs. She’s playing with a stick twice her size right now and giggling in that way that only she can. If only her mother could see her. She’d hate seeing her playing with a stick though, too many germs she’d say.

I think Julie’s dead. I can’t turn my head much, but there’s a lot of blood on the dash, and other … things. I fell in love with her when I was twelve. I never told her that.

There was a deer. I couldn’t stop, so I swerved and…

Now we’re here. And Sarah needs me.

I can’t speak, I tried yelling earlier but I couldn’t even move my lips. I’m getting cold, and I’m so tired.

She’s never even looked over here. She must have climbed out of the back window or something. I just want to get her home. She needs her medicine soon. She can’t be here.

I thought I could feel my toes earlier, but now there’s nothing. The pain in my arm is beginning to fade, I can feel myself slipping, and I’m so scared for her.

Sarah is staring at me. She’s smiling with her big green eyes and she’s so happy. I want to reach out and hug her; I want to tell her that everything will be better soon, I want to tell her that I’ll be there whenever she needs me.

I’m getting out of here.

I strain; I struggle with every bit of energy I have left but there’s nothing I can move now. Even my eyelids are getting harder to keep open. I try holding her stare with all of my failing will.

I see Julie with her now. She’s sitting beside her, smiling weakly at me.

I hear the sirens.

I don’t want to hear them. I don’t want them to find me.

I can’t let them find me. Not now.

Sarah blows a kiss at me, and Julie whispers goodbye.

DisposableInbox;11;0;"I’m a software developer who build mobile and web apps. One functionality I’m pretty used to build is login and sign up pages.

During development, one tool I use to make my life easier is a disposable email generator, so I can validate the confirmation email is arriving properly.

The app I use to generate these emails is called DisposableInbox, and it is straightforward: you click ‘generate email’ and it displays an inbox to you. Once this address receives an ‘electronic mail’, it immediately displays it in there. As simple as that.

Then I generated this disposable email addressed as ‘billsmth14@qqmail.net’, and one thing that caught my attention was that the moment the inbox was displayed to me, the address immediately received an email without subject.

I opened it, and all that I saw was an IP address. Hmm, curious and exquisite. I refreshed it a few times and that’s it - no additional emails.

So I went ahead and generated another email address. Guess what? The inbox immediately received this other email. No subject again.

This time its content were two pairs of numbers. I copied and pasted it on Google and they seemed to be a latitude and a longitude. I sweat when I realized it matched with my own address.

Fuck it. I generated another inbox. Same thing, but now the content was ‘9:21 PM’.

I checked the clock; 8:26 PM.

I know that retrieving IP address, latitude and longitude, a random time after the current one is no big deal in software development, but what’s going on here? This never happened before with this same software, so c’mon.

The goosebumps hit me when I generated this last disposable email. Its content reads my real full name, ‘Adam von Seriso’. Now that’s not something the machine is able to easily figure out of a complete anonymous app.

Wtf?

Gold;66;6;"All I see is gold. The streets are made of gold, as are the houses and the pillars of my palace. Golden statues sparkle in the golden sunlight, bordering the golden paths. My dress is made of gold and gold is braided into my hair. I am their new queen.

I have grown suspicious of the high priest. He is making himself appear kind-hearted, however, there is something evil in his eyes, something dark in his smile. I shall have him executed in the morning.

Before I can give the word, I am called into the courtyard. That vile man, performing one of his dances. But something is different, unfamiliar, and utterly wrong. Terror surges through my body as I am blinded by impossible eldritch whiteness.

There he is, their Great Sun-God. The one I thought was a myth painted onto walls. He comes down from the sky and strikes me with his divine light.
I come to a sudden realization: I am not their queen, I am a sacrifice. A sacrifice for their youth and prosperity. I never had any power, it was all a cruel charade. How many had come before me? If only I had not stayed. If only I had returned home with the researchers. Empty-handed, but safe. I had been foolish and vain. The Great Sun-God feeds on my foolishness and vanity.

The Juice;27;2;"It is said to be the greatest breakthrough of the century, a safe and unlimited source of power, with the potential to power the entire globe, the only cost coming from building the machines themselves.

They call them harvesters, massive tube like structures the size of skyscrapers that stand proud reaching up into the sky of every city in the empire. Their power output is unmatched, as long as they are well stocked up on the juice of course, but we never have a shortage of that.

It is crazy to think that the very same stuff that nourished us for so long is now the thing that powers our cities, and soon the entire globe. We are living in an age of true wonders!.

Farms were established all over the empire in order for us to keep our stockpiles of the juice up at all times. We have never run low once, thanks to the hard work of our farmers.

People protested at first, but that was swiftly put to an end as soon as it begun. This was a new age, one that was finally ours.

The blood tax was imposed on humans that wished to live in our utopia, those that were not farmed were required to pay two pints of blood to the goverment every week. While the rest of us get by on lab created blood to survive, the rich elites enjoyed the real stuff, and the farmed blood was strictly for powering our empire, animal blood would not power the harvesters.

Those that do not pay their taxes, or commit crimes become livestock, where they will be subjected to a horrific demise for the good of our growing empire.

I have seen the process of extracting the juice, and they always scream, so I assume it is not very nice to have to experience. They begin by inserting two pipes leading directly to the harvester into the neck, and chest, then a button is pushed, and the agonised screaming begins until they eventually die.

For thousands of years our kind hid in the shadows, but now we live openly amongst humans. Once upon a time we was the hunted, but now we have an empire that is continuing to grow bigger night by night.

Harvester technology has made our military the most advanced in the world, soon there will be no nation that shall stand in the way of our global domination.

You pay the blood tax, or you become our battery.

My own personal haunting;18;3;"I think I'm being haunted... Or... At least that's the only thing I've been able to describe it as. I'm not talking about a poltergeist that knocks some items off the shelf. That would be heaven compared to this hell.

My haunting is a man. I think it's a man anyway. He's with me all the time. 2 inches from the side of my face. Constantly. Staring. He doesn't speak to me, and never ever touches me, but he's there always and has been there always for the last 3 years, 5 months, 26 days and 14 hours.

His face is dark and weeping, like sores, flowing in  sticky residue from an old wound. His wrinkled lips curl away from his thick teeth, as his hot stale breath leaves a faint condensation on my face like mould on a basement window. In and out he breathes. Wheezing and rumbling the clagging phlegm in the back of his throat. His half eaten nose leaks a stagnant molasses, down the side of his face, drip, drip, drip onto my shoulder and down my neck. His deep, jagged, constant, never ever blinking eyes are the worst part. They never stop staring. Always on me. Even when I look in the mirror, I can see him, every hunched, dripping, infested part of his right side, facing me, staring, 2 inches from the side of my face.

When I close my eyes, I hear him worse, louder, closer. His angry growling soul eminating from his dead heart, up out of his chest, rising into his rotten mouth and out all over my face.

No one else can see him, but a few people who have gotten close enough have turned an involuntary nose at something they probably put down to me having unwashed teeth. They have no idea the true horror of that smell in my reality. Decaying store bought meat emitting sulphurous gasses mixed with fecal matter and the high pitch metallic notes of iron in festering blood on a butchers block.

Every second of my life I am terrified. Faking my way through bated breathe, holding back tears as I try to live my normal life. I am living through hell and all I want to do is die.

But worse than living through my haunting is the intense feeling I get every time I try to end my life, that this is exactly what he's waiting for.";16183090750

You see, when ""they"" (it certainly wasn't a legit government organization, in retrospect) launched a program for ""infinite space exploration"", I got excited. You know, like how you get on meth.

The storms remind me of the volatility of human contact, which I miss terribly.

The Believer;14;1;"The citizen left the building and strolled outside, humming to himself. Suddenly, he realized there was some sort of civil disturbance going on. Several ran screaming, others clad in dark clothes gave chase. A few small fires burned, some from cars, some from storefronts. Before he could react, the citizen noticed a militant-looking stranger, and his partner, running up to him.

""Raise your fist and declare allegiance to my cause!"" the militant shouted. On his shoulders were the logo of his faction, a pair of crossed hammers.

""What's your cause?"" the citizen inquired.

""Equality! Freedom! Justice!"" screamed the militant, shivering with quasi-religious fervor.

The citizen looked around. ""I don't see any of that here. I just see fear and chaos."" A bottle sailed overhead and crashed into the ground several feet away, shattering.

""We're going to cause chaos until the government gives us what we want!"" the militant screeched. ""They'll *have* to listen to us! We *demand* it!""

The citizen frowned. ""You can frame your beliefs with as much emotion and angst as you want, but if the answer is politics, you lost me right there.""

This confused the militant. ""How come?"" A loud explosion ripped through the air two blocks away, spawning a small shower of automotive shrapnel.

""Politicians are just in it for themselves,"" the citizen patiently explained. ""They'll support your cause for as long as they think they can get something out of it, then toss you aside when it's convenient. Mainstream politics is just a cover for the rich and powerful to maintain control over us by tricking us into fighting each other. And if you've fallen for their scam, I don't want to join your cause.""

Stammering, the militant brandished a club with spikes nailed through the end. ""It doesn't matter; *I'm* the one with the weapon!""

The citizen cocked his head as he stared back. ""So your cause is might-makes-right?""

""Damn *straight*!"" the militant beamed.

""Then you have more in common with the government than I thought,"" sighed the citizen. ""It has abused might-makes-right *so* many times.""

""Uh...er...shut the heck up!"" the militant sputtered. ""Raise your fist and pledge allegiance to my cause, or I'll *kill you*!""

""I'm really sorry to hear that,"" the citizen said quietly.

The militant looked uneasily at the citizen, perplexed. The citizen perked up slightly, hoping he'd seen humanity in his eyes. Suddenly, the militant began pounding the citizen with his club. A dozen or so blows later, and the citizen lay crumpled in the street, not moving.

The militant's partner glared at him. ""Was that *really* necessary?""

""It's...it's all for the *cause*!"" the militant choked.

His partner looked taciturn. ""The backlash from acting like this isn't going to help further the cause, you know.""

The militant looked down. ""I...I just want an excuse to act like a violent bully. The cause gives me that."" He saw another person leave a nearby building. The militant ran towards him. ""Hey! You! Raise your fist and pledge allegiance to my cause!""";16183073990
Our building now allows pets into the apartments;5;1;"Were allowed pets in the building now and I am a concierge for a residential building. I've worked her nearly 3 years and for the first two years no pets were allowed to be kept or brought into the building. The amount of times residents snuck in a pet is too many to count and equally the amount of times us concierges had to tell off residents for bringing in pets is equal. People love pets and recently the owners have now allowed residents to keeps pets due to laws and needing more people to move in. 

We now get complaints from residents about dog poo within the building or noise coming from some animal in someone's apartment. There are always problems working in a residential building. Recently a resident has called down the reception while I was on a night shift and she has lost her pet. Inside my mind I was sweating at this woman as I couldn't be bothered dealing with these kinds of problems. When I first got the job I was told what concierges do is just sit in a reception, watch the camera, do some parcel processing and sometimes call the police. The reality of this job is that you are dealing with resident problems and with their complicated lives. 

I asked this woman what this pet was and what it looked like and she didn't know what kind of animal her pet was but the description she gave me was ""it has two arms, two legs, a body, a head, two eyes, 1 nose, 1 mouth and 2 ears"" the phone then got cut off by somebody pressing the buzzer on the front door. I then heard a child crying in the club room next to the reception and I could see it on the camera as well. It was a child. 

I called the woman and said ""I think I found your pet it has two arms, two legs, a body, a head, two eyes, 1 nose, 1 mouth and 2 ears"" and she came down she grabbed the child and put a dog collar around the boy. I was chuffed that I solved a problem. One thing I do love about being a concierge is being able to solve residents problems.";16183272030
I found a dog today;0;4;"   I was driving down a quiet highway. It was dark and a dog jumped in front of my car. I slammed on the breaks and rolled down the window to look around and this dog jumped through. I freaked out a bit but the dog wasn't attacking so I looked for a collar and didn't see one. After a minute I decided to take it home since it didn't seem to have an owner. I stopped at a fast food place to get something to eat because it looked like it hadn't been fed properly but it refused to eat. Ok i'll just take it to the vet tomorrow
   Once we got to the house i put a few pillows on the floor so it would have somewhere to sleep. I went to walk away but it started barking. I looked at the dog and it stopped barking. Then it walked up to me so i pet it. It started shaking then I watched in horror as the dog I brought home opened its mouth and turned itself inside-out only to reveal the giant monster it was. It was a humanoid figure except it was twice the size and its skin looked dark and rough as if it was charred to a crisp. It's head, a perfect circle, no eyes, nose, ears, or hair. It's mouth opened up to reveal it was blood red with some crimson dripping off of one of the thousands of teeth it had. Each tooth was about the size of my finger and looked sharper than anything I've ever seen. It let out a shriek right before it launched itself at me. I didn't even have time to think before it bit my head off my neck, and my lifeless body hit the ground.";16183579590
My Only Friend Is Man;24;5;"I run from the house. I do not look back until my name is called. 

“Ah, we must be going somewhere exciting”

I run towards the car. I am directed into the back part. I hesitate. For a moment. I trust him. I leap forward.

Closed. Dark. Rumbling.

Closed. Dark. Shaking.

Closed. Dark.

I make myself as small as I can. I try to listen out for sounds I recognise. I have never been in this place. I hear things that I don’t understand. 

The sounds stop. The movement stops. I try to listen to what is going on. I don’t understand. 

The door opens. I see a familiar face. I am happy. I leap down and look around. This place is unfamiliar, but I am happy. I am happy to be here with someone I know. 

I feel the comfort of his hand running through my hair. I spin and run and run. I feel the grass against me. I do circles around until my name is called again. Nearly exhausted I wonder. What are we doing here? I am getting cold. I don’t understand 

I get close to him. I keep staring. His face looks different. I am getting tired, but his hand feels nice. I am comforted. Suddenly, I cannot move. I feel my neck is tight. I look back. I am trapped on a post.

I pull against it. Tight. I feel choked. I shake and shake and shake. I cannot get loose. I watch and call for help. He turns away. I try call him back. I keep calling. 

He can’t hear me? He walks more. I don’t understand. I keep calling. How can he forget? He doesn’t know I am stuck? I pull against the post, but cannot shake free. The car speeds away. He disappears. 

It’s really cold. I am cold. The rain is pouring down. I keep calling until I cannot anymore. I wait for a long time. It gets darker and darker. I curl up for warmth. 

I try to stay awake. When he comes back, he’ll want to know that I am ready to leave this place. I don’t understand, but he’ll be back. It is dark now. I hear noises that I don’t know. He will be back. Won’t he?";16182949420
Failed samurai;4;5;A silhouette of a gaunt female figure began to take shape among the ebb of inky fog. By its long braid, the woman held a severed head, only one eye socket clearly visible, exposing the white of bone underneath. The other side fared much better. Then, without uttering a sound, the woman shifted her gaze to pierce the eyes of the weary warrior. “COME, KILL ME! I am ready for death” she shouted with a cold intensity, prepared to meet her end at last, and so the warrior, hell bent on rage and fury, pulled out his 16’ cold pressed steel katana and began his charge, but just as he approached the gaunt female pulled out a misshapened dagger, and plunged it deep into the warriors gut, each inch felt until it hit the spine, she then crackled a smile that grinned from ear to ear and spoke in a deep demonic tone “you played with powers you didn’t understand, and paid the price” with that she pulled the dagger out from his gut, blood spewed from the chest and his entrails were pulled from his body. As he lay there, bleeding out the woman walked over and placed the severed head next to his, and he died staring into the lifeless sockets.;16183234390
Fresh Air;826;25;"“Honey, I just wanted to let you know I’m heading up for Fresh Air.” 

“Ugh…is it that time again? Please…please be careful.” She takes my face between her soft hands and plants a kiss on my lips. 

It’s not my first time out, and I’m sure it won’t be my last. On my way through the dimly-lit, stone tunnel leading up to the surface, a good number of Station Five residents line the walk to bid me farewell. Their pale faces reveal a mix of emotions: apprehension, concern, fear, pride, and—most of all—hope. 

“Good thing,” someone says, in an attempt to lighten the mood, “it’s been getting a bit stuffy down here.” No one laughs. This is serious business.

The stone-faced captain meets me at the airlock. “It’s clear out there, Jordan. No wasp activity detected. Turrets took down a beetle right next to the drop point, last night. We’ve kept a good eye on it; it should be dead. Make sure your weapon is at the ready, though. Got it?”

“Yes, sir.”

Our new alien overlords, in case you hadn't heard, are giant…let’s just call them “insects”. The “wasps” that the captain mentioned measure approximately six feet in height, not counting a two-foot-long, venom-dripping stinger. The “beetles”…well, we measure those in school bus lengths. The captain says this one is about a three-busser, so not that bad.

It’s because of these “insects” that the decision was taken to poison the atmosphere. So far, it seems to be working; there have been much fewer sightings, lately. The problem is that the air is now also highly toxic to us humans, and we’re completely dependent on government airdrops of “Fresh Air” filter tubes. This week, it’s my job to collect them. 

“There’s only one filter out there, son. New technology. Should be a piece of cake.”

I don my protective gear. The airlock hisses open, revealing a swirling, yellow cloud of poisonous air which instantly starts to disintegrate my suit. No time to dawdle. 

Fifty yards away, I see the tube. Written on its side in giant block letters: FRESH AIR. Within spitting distance, is the beetle. It’s lying on its back; lifeless, segmented legs slightly extended above. Blue ichor leaks from huge bullet holes in its side.

*Move it, Jordan!* I tell myself, as I pull the tracked transport across the rocky, moon-like terrain which used to be lush vegetation.

Forty yards…thirty…twenty…fifteen…

There’s a loud cracking sound in the direction of the beetle, followed by a loud humming and droning noise. Wings. Wasp wings. Dozens of them. They’re boiling out of the remains of the beetle now. It’s an ambush!

Gunfire sounds from Station Five. Wasps are notoriously hard to target: they’re so fast. Under a hail of lead, I grasp the tube and heft it onto the wagon. Only then do I notice a giant hole in its exterior. Sabotaged. It’s bait. They're getting smarter…

The airlock seems a million miles away. I run…";16182151490
It's my birthday;65;10;"""Cake!!""

""Cake!!""

""Cake!!""

All my friends chant around me as I prepare to cut. 

It's looked as if I was happy. And I almost felt like I was. I was grinning ear to ear. 

But I wasn't happy. With my dad dead, my mom dying, and my sister Susan dead before she was even born, I wasn't exactly in a good state of mind.

""I have to go visit her tonight."" I reminded myself. I knew how lonely those sterile rooms could be. She looked not 5 minutes away from dying, but she held on for me.

I cut the cake.

Cheers erupted as I pulled out the slice and ate it.

I felt someone push me down. When I came back up, the cake was ruined and my face was covered in frosting.

""Not funny, Johnny!', I mockingly scolded him.

But that's the thing about Johnny. You never can seem to stay mad at him for long.

So before long, we were all partiyng. The clock struck 10, and we eventually all filtered out leaving only me and Johnny. 

We walked to my car, arms around each others shoulders. He was drink and wouldn't stop singing ""Happy Birthday"" in his slurred voice. It was getting to me.

I dropped him off at his house, where he planted face first onto the lawn. I didn't bother picking him up. Too tired to even try.

But I had to visit Mom.

So I did.

She was pale. And looked a million years old. Half of her body was covered in wires and tubes keeping her alive. And next to her bed, her IV drip stood like a gaunt guardian to its equally gaunt patient.

She held out her hands and said something. I couldn't hear her so I bent closer to listen better.

""Let...*wheeze* me...*wheeze* die...*wheeze* please..."", followed by a intense coughing fit. 

After it had subsided, I started speaking.

""Not until you sign this letter stating that you killed Dad and Susan.""

""I didn't!"", she protested, following it up with an even more violent fit of coughing.

""I know that"", I continued, ""but it's the only way to guarantee my freedom, mom.""

""Never..."", she said with a tone that pissed me off. 

""So be it.""

I picked up the pillow and snuffed her. Her struggle lasted only a few seconds.

I packed my important stuff into a bag and  came out of the basement, leaving mom's body in her bed.

Oh the smell of gas!! I turned all the knobs to max, and made my way out of the house. 

As I lit the candle, I hummed ""Happy Birthday"" to myself. 

""Happy Birthday to you!"", the house seemed to scream at me as the flames consumed it. 

A few days later, I saw Johnny's name in the paper. ""Victim of stabbing dies before revealing name of killer.""

Good. All had gone according to plan.

Greatest gift ever.";16182649010
Just Me and My Reflection;7;3;"
Caroline woke up strapped to a bed in a white room full of people with long white coats on. They were all facing away from her. Growing up in a not-so-safe neighborhood taught her a lot about survival. She struggled a little and looked around the room for anything sharp to cut herself out of the thick, white leather around her wrists. There was nothing sharp. Caroline knew that if she wanted to get out of the room she would have to find a door. There was no door. The panic started to set in and she noticed that she could barely breathe. She gazed at the people standing around her, they seemed as though they were closer to her now. Caroline knew she was not claustrophobic but no matter how many times she blinked, the walls kept closing in on her. She closed her eyes. How did she get here? What happened to her? She struggled to remember her last memory. Her eyes flashed open to see that the room was empty and the bed had disappeared. Caroline was sitting on a white tiled floor, her reflection looked back at her. She started to gasp for breath, she closed her eyes. Laying her head back on the cold tile. As the air was being sucked out of her, Caroline started to recall her last memory. She remembered a black room full of faceless people in long black jackets. The dark walls moving in towards a black metal bed with a girl strapped to it. The scientists and the bed disappeared, leaving the girl on the floor. She sat up and looked straight into my eyes then laid back down. Within seconds, the girl had suffocated and lay dead on the floor.";16182871880
Luck of the Devil;90;3;"“So, you want to get extra lucky, right Zephyr?” His voice was like maple syrup in my ears.

I didn’t ask how he knew my name, let alone what my deepest, darkest wish was. I was just sitting at the bar with a glass of wine, wallowing over the fact that my boss suddenly fired me on the spot, tears springing to my eyes, when this man siddled next to me on a barstool.

And then whispered those gentle words into my ears.

“Yes, I wish!” I replied, trying to keep my voice even.

“Everything comes at a price, Zephyr.”

I had an inkling on who I was dealing with when he said those words. Is it worth it?

Yes, yes it is.

“I really want it. Please..” I almost whisper my plea.

He grinned back. “Perfect! Done.” Then he almost melted back into the shadows of the night.

I was surprised he didn’t demand my soul or anything else in return. I didn’t even know if he would keep his word. But when a car missed me by a hair’s breadth when I stepped outside, I knew everything was true.

I am the luckiest woman alive.

I spent the next few days celebrating my luck, partying like it was 1985. Everything I wanted seemed to fall at my feet. I even entered the lottery and won jackpot. With the money I bought everything I ever wanted.

But my happiness never lasted long.

First came the wolves. Fifty feet tall, they loped along with strong hind legs. Muscles rippled under matte grey fur, and drool escaped their red tongues, sandwiched between pointed teeth.

Nobody was safe from their hunger. Everyone lost someone they loved. They woke up the next morning to find their loved ones spread-eagled on the carpet with a jagged hole in their chest where their hearts used to be and hair dyed crimson with blood. But they skipped my house. My son was safe.

Then came the fire. Somebody was careless and it raged into an inferno, big red flames that leaped from house to house and coughed up a lot of smoke. People ran outside, shouting, but it was too late for them; they were swallowed up by the hungry flames, their bones crumbling to ashes and their bodies burned to a crisp.

But I alone remained unscathed.

Perhaps it was my deal with the devil, so I am alive today. But I lost everything. Nobody else was as lucky as me to be alive. My son, my friends, my family. All gone by the inferno.

I wander now, from house to house, scavenging what I can find, although the fire left nearly nothing behind. Once I found a gun, and cocked it against my head, praying for a quick, easy death, so I could see my son in heaven instead of suffering alone…

The bullet missed my head by a few inches. I can’t die.

I am the luckiest woman alive.";16182331480
The lady in the pink Saree;2;2;"This did not happen to me it happened to the security guard of our school.My mother is a teacher so he used to sometimes visit us for some work and one time he told us this story.
It was 12 or 1 am he lived in a village area so he used to reach home quite late most days.That day was the same but there are 2 roads to go to his home.1 normal rode which is perfectly normal but it takes about 30-40 minutes to get to his home via that rode but the other rode which is said to be haunted by a witch takes 15-20 to get to his home and that rode.So most days he used to go through the normal rode but that day he was in a hurry so he used the haunted rode.It was all perfectly fine and normal until a lady in a pink Saree(indian clothing) asked him for a ride.He was quite shocked to see a lady this late at night alone.Anyways he asked her where would she like to go,she pointed in a direction where there were a couple of houses.So he thought she lived in one of those houses.Anyways he agreed and gave her a lift.It was pretty normal mostly she was having conversation with him and yeah everything was fine until he for some reason decided to check the mirror in his bike and to his horror the lady was wearing a pink Saree and she was soaked in blood and had a knife in her hands.As soon as he saw that he got quite nervous and shocked while st he was shocked the bike fell into a lake and he somehow jumped out and the bike and the lady both fell in the lake.At this point he was really scarred so he knocked the doors of a house to ask if he can stay but to his horror the lady in the pink Saree soaked in blood with a knife in her hand answered the door.Now he knew she was not human she was a witch so he started resiting hanuman chalisa(religious book) and he started to run for his life.He saw a cycle on the road he used that cycle to run home as soon as possible and when he got home the first thing he did was drink water and call his relatives.";16183177250
Last Bullet;20;5;"The pistol quavered in my slick palms as I edged slowly backward until my back bumped into the brick wall.

Dead end.

Dead right, I thought sourly. I grimaced, wondering again how I did I possibly allowed it to follow me into this dark alley.

Stupid, stupid, stupid!

Now, everything rode upon this final shot. There was zero room for error.

A headshot.

Nothing else would suffice. Even if I managed to wing the goddamned thing, I would never get past it and make it back out onto the street.

Hell, I didn’t think I would be able to take another step without collapsing, let alone manage to keep running.

I was scared shitless. Sweat stung my eyes, blurring my vision. my exhausted legs trembled, threatening to cave from fatigue. But I couldn’t afford to lose focus—not now. Not when concentration and that final bullet were all that stood between him and . . .

The infected barreled into sight, and I found himself staring down a giant. Decked in combat boots, urban camouflage, and utility webbing, the thing was clearly a member of the Indian military.

Strike that, I thought. Must be an unlucky guard.

Gore caked its maw, chest and shoulders, while drool sprayed past its bared teeth like streamers. Its left leg was a jumble of savaged flesh and fractured bone. 

Its right arm had been severed at the elbow. The bloody stump hemorrhaged freely, macabre spraying the asphalt in its wake.

There was no hesitation, no stutter in the thing’s gait . . . and why would there be? The son of a bitch knew I had bumbled down this passageway. It charged forward, devouring the distance at a lope.

I fought to steady the gun. I forced my breathing to slow down, narrowing my eyes at its approach. Mere yards separated me from death or worse, but I had to be patient. I had to delay pulling the trigger until the last possible second.

The infected’s hunched posture made a headshot problematic. Its awkward stride made such a shot even more difficult. The fact the fucking thing was sprinting made the task all but impossible.

Closer

Closer

Closer, Now the smell of its rotting flesh was disturbing my senses.

However, I had anticipated all of this.

I inhaled deeply.

Closed my eyes.

Thought of mother. Steadied my mind.

Bit down on the cold steel of the barrel and pulled the trigger. AND….

Cycling;1092;56;"My seven year old daughter woke me up early and reminded me that I had promised to take her to the bike park. I assured her that I hadn't forgotten and would take her in an hour or so. I couldn't help but smile as she kissed me on cheek before running out of the room.

When I was eventually dressed and went downstairs, she had already gotten all of her equipment ready. I reminded her to bring a helmet but she said she had already thrown it in the car.

We arrived at the bike park early and there didn't seem to be anyone else around. I helped her get all set up and made sure that she had all of her safety equipment on.

She let out a shriek of delight as she started cycling along one of the paths while I grabbed a seat, where I could watch her from a distance but also stay out of her way.

I glanced down at my phone to see a message from my wife reminding me to grab milk on the way home. When I looked back up my daughter was still cycling along but there seemed to be something wrong with her body. 

She suddenly collapsed to the ground and I quickly jumped out of my seat and ran over to see what was wrong. The blood drained from my face as I stood over her.

I turned and looked back along the path she had just cycled, to see her head still wearing the helmet. She still had a smile on her face even in death.

The sunlight glinted off something just above her head, so I walked over and discovered a razor sharp wire that was going across the width of the path. The shock of what I had just witnessed wore off and I slumped to the ground weeping";16181783960
The Sun Always Sets Twice;197;17;"Every day, at least every one of mine, the sun always sets twice.  I can’t explain it and I don’t expect you to understand it.  How could I?  No one does.  Nor does anyone ever believe me.  I’ve tried to explain it, but I just end up either being called weird or the butt of jokes.  I can’t go to school….. but, you’ll understand why later.

The first time it happened was years ago.  Before then, nothing seemed out of place.  I was at the park with a bunch of friends just enjoying the summer.  Propped up on my elbows, I gazed out across the lake languidly and listened to the distant sounds of laughter and splashing.  Passive noises always lull me into an almost meditative state and my thoughts were both everywhere and nowhere at once.  The smell of burgers grilling and suntan lotion were a sweet mixture on the breeze.  The skies slowly changed as fingers of sunlight curled in its leaving.  Purpling clouds were couched in the soft tangerine of the early evening.  Serenity is the only word I’ve ever found which matches moments such as these.

I watched with my friends as the sun set.

As the final edge of the glowing saucer slipped below the horizon, everything…...glitched.   A harsh, grinding sound filled the air and my stomach rose.  I retched hard, but nothing came out, not even bile.  It’s always just a dry-heave.

“Are…..okay…..hey….help..” were snippets of the reactions of my friends before everything and everyone suddenly changed.

And then, my stomach stopped lurching and I started picking back up on the life around me.  I smelled burgers and suntan lotion.  I heard playing and splashing.  But I was alone.  None my friends were there and the people…. they weren’t right.  I watched the sun set for the second time that day before grabbing my towel and going home.

When I got there, my parents were hysterical.

“Where were you/ what were you doing/ are you okay/ you’re grounded!”  They were a mix of confusion, frustration and anger and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why.

“What the hell are you on about!?” I asked.  “I was at the park like I told you!”  I shouted.

“That was twenty-four hours ago and we’ve been sick looking for you.  All your friends could say was that you disappeared.”  I was shocked and couldn’t say anything.  I stood there slack-jawed for what seemed hours.  The rest of the night went by in a blur, but dread was a rock weighing my stomach down.

The next night, the sun set twice again.  And again the next and has ever since.

If you ever hear of someone else who suffers the same as I do, please tell them about me; and let them know they’re not alone.";16182099270
Only I can see it.;60;6;"I first saw it as a child.

It was far away, yet too close for comfort.

It watched with what only I could describe as malicious intent, I could never make it out, I could never see it's features, what it was made of or if it was even a person.

As I got older, the closer it got and the clearer the image of this.. disturbing entity could be seen.

At around the age of 12, I finally started hearing it though and not just seeing it, I heard it's dreadful moaning... the sound was something not of this world, it did not sound in pain, it sounded hungry...

It never stopped, I tried my best to drown it out but I could still hear it, even in my dreams..

The face... well the face was only something you want to see in your nightmares, it was emaciated, skinny and thin, you could see it's sunken in face and it's burning piercing pitch black eyes.. and it was pale, as pale as a dead man.

I always tried to point it out, I always tried to get others to see it, but they saw nothing, eventually by the age of 14.

I was sent to the mental ward.. and that was a living hell, as each year passed it only grew closer and I failed to mention, but when I was younger it would only stay outside.

But when I hit 14 it started to follow me inside... I'd see it in my closet, I'd see it in the hall, I'd see even when I was showering, it's thin frame outlined through the curtains of the shower...  and the moans... the god awful moans they only got louder and it's moans more hungering...

By age 16, It was no longer just standing, it was roaming now, crawling along the walls and the ceilings like a cockroach scattering when the lights are turned on.

One day, it came too close for comfort, I could feel it's hot breath.. as it stared into my soul with it's black beady eyes, it was face to face with me and I was terrified, I was only able to do one thing and one thing only... the words escaped my lips as I demanded to know ""What are you?!?!"", and it just stared and by god it smiled... it fucking smiled at me.. It had the malice and the stare of a predator.

And it said to me, in it's deep raspy almost unintelligible voice  ""I am what's to come.""

It then opened it's jaws wide, and then let out the worst sound I'd ever heard, a deep guttural loud sounding scream.

I flinched and was jarred back closing my eyes to not see what would happen next.

and then...... nothing,  It did not pounce, it did not attack, I opened my eyes and it was no longer there.

For the first time in my whole life, it had went away.

I am now currently 63 years old.. I have been married and had kids, and yes even grandkids... but all things from the past come back to haunt you one way or another... I was recently diagnosed with cancer, and although my eyesight fails me... I can see something.. something... in the distance.";16182289410
The Quilt;158;5;"It was a tradition among the Farrow women that upon the death of a husband a memory of him be sewn onto the family quilt. This undertaking had been performed for nearly four hundred years, and the quilt had become something of a fabric cemetery.

So when Maria's beloved, Hans, passed away at the commendable age of 79, one of the first things she did was to look through a parade of old photos. Hans wasn't particularly handsome but possessed something better: kindness. Their three children, all with their own families now, were raised with effortless benignity. He was good in bed as well, Maria smiled, thinking of their shared orgasms and pleasures.

She picked up a photograph of him from 1986. Dapper in his dark blue suit and clipped beard, his three boys stood beside him. Maria felt herself getting upset so she tidied up and fetched the quilt. Her sister was the last to have it and delivered it the night before Hans' departure.

A week after his burial, when her sympathisers had slowly started to move back to their own lives, Maria was sitting by the fireplace, fingering the quilt, looking at all the previous portraits. She placed the photograph on the arm of the sofa and started to sew.

It took her a week to finish her contribution to the Farrow quilt. Her sister, Mary, had called a few times to ask how she was getting on, eager to see it. Maria found it hard going but understood the familial importance of what she was doing.

On the way to her sister's, she popped in to see each of her children.

At Mary's, a cup of tea was waiting for her. A couple of sneaky custard creams accompanied it. Mary asked Maria if she wanted to go upstairs. Maria nodded, and was led to the master bedroom.

Maria unpacked the quilt and placed it, patterned side, over the large mirror in the corner of the bedroom. The sisters sat on the bed, waiting.

Then they heard a scream from the quilt. Then another. Then two more. Mary raced to the mirror and tore off the comforter. Pushing Maria aside, she laid the quilt on the bed.

The sewn face of Hans stared back at her in stitched horror. Beside him were fabric memorials of Maria's three sons, all with lost, terrified looks.

""You put your boys on there?"" Mary confronted Maria. ""We agreed only husbands!""

""I want to go home!"" Maria yelled back. ""I hate this world. I thought- I thought if we sent more loved menfolk for Mum to torment she would see how sorry we are?""

Mary sighed.

""Alright. Let's see.""

They touched the mirror, hoping to be finally forgiven and pulled back inside. Instead, they watched their aged bodies revert back to the two children rejected by their man-hating witch of a mother in the mirror world.

Pictures of a moonlit and snowy night when I was having my dinner. My girls loved the pictures of the wild animals he would send, or the creepy big camel spiders hanging out in the hungers shadows. 

About a week ago he sent a series of photos and then stopped altogether. 

The first one was just a night scene. A building in the background. And a light casting shadows from behind the picture. Lots of shadows, mixed over one another in chaotic forms. 

The second picture showed the same scene, camera slightly up, showing a sky lit in orange. I checked the time stamps and they were just a few second apart. Apparently enough time to take and send the pictures. 

The third picture showed just a bit of the buildings roof and something rising in the distance, a large and greenish-brown ball creating the horizon like a sun rise. 

The final picture was taken under the light of this thing that rose into the sky. It bled light like our sun shines. And in its glow my fathers face looked skeletal and dark. His skin gaunt. 

The only words he sent were “And the sun shall rise backwards tomorrow, goodnight son”

That was three days ago. And the sun hasn’t risen since.";16182327980
I'm only here for the comments;20;2;"I'm only here for the comment section because I hope to see a comment from my daughter. My daughter loved helping small businesses and she only shopped at small shops and small cafes. She sort of made it her life mission to help small businesses as much as possible. I use to tell her that it was ok to shop at the larger more well known brands but she took it as an insult. I do sometimes regret not seeing her passion for helping small businesses as much as I should. 

Then a small funeral service home popped up and my daughter saw it as another chance to help a small business. She started working in a care home and under her care many old people started to die and were sent to this small funeral service home to take care of the dead bodies as well as the funeral. I didn't want to question my daughter as she was so passionate about what she was doing. Then when she switched jobs to become a nurse at a hospital, many patients started to mysteriously die and this small funeral home had received all of the dead bodies to take care of. 

Then my daughter disappeared and for months I was worried sick and there were a series of investigations that were being taken forward against my daughter. I then started to find comments from my daughter on random YouTube videos from my daughter confessing to helping the small funeral home again, by sending them more dead bodies. Even though it was random and worrying I was glad it was my daughter as her picture and name was on the username. 

Then as she was close to being caught, I found another comment from my daughter on another random YouTube video. This time she said that she was killing herself as a last good thing to do to help the small funeral home and especially helping a small business. I commented on that comment begging her not to do it but I never found a comment from her on any other random youtube video after that. I guess she knew me really well and knew what kind of YouTube videos I watch. 

I am always hopelessly going on any website, forum and video web pages in the hopes of finding a comment from my daughter.";16182400290
This World of Grey;14;3;"I suppose you deserve an explanation first.

Something broke in me when I watched the man cry over the body of his best friend.

Something broke, and I don’t feel anything anymore. No hate, no love either. No shame, no pride. No pain, no pleasure.

I feel no sympathy for you. You are so pathetic, so fragile, like *he* was, that man I remember, sobbing over something he could never have back. 

Something broke, and my existence repainted itself in shades of grey. I see danger, but I feel no fear. I see safety, but I feel no comfort. I see beautiful things, I see hideous things, but they are meaningless to me. This empty world of grey is meaningless.

Something broke, and now I live only for the sake of not dying. I no longer cry, I no longer smile, except to manipulate people like you. You are *so* easy to manipulate. I was too, once. I look at you and I know I can toss you around like a plaything. I look at you and I know I can make you laugh one moment, bring you to tears the next.

Something broke in me when I watched myself cry over the body of my best friend. I buried my heart when I buried him, somewhere I never find myself again.

Something broke, and I put myself back together all wrong. But I won’t let myself get broken again. I can’t afford to be broken again.

We could have had something, in another time. You make me feel things that a part of me would have wanted, a world ago.

I had to kill that part of me.

Now, I’m afraid, I must kill you too.";16182355580
My Imagination Might Be Too Strong;125;6;"It was 8:00 p.m. on a Sunday. I was passed out in the park, as was my way. Please don't judge. 

I woke up to this guy running away with my wallet and cell phone. An unwelcome sight, to be sure. I ran after him but... it had been a few days since I had eaten. I was weak and slow. Frustrated, in an act of delirious rage, I pointed my finger at the retreating figure like a gun, as children often do. I sighed and said, ""boom, boom, boom"".  

To my surprise, crimson rivulets started flowing from his back as his jacket ripped apart. Suddenly, I found myself in a world of trouble. Legal trouble. Trouble not nearly worth my wallet and cellphone. 

I was searched for weapons, and nothing was found. But that hardly matters when you are a drunk in the park. No one believed me when I said it was just a ""finger gun"", unsurprisingly. 

In the USA, time spent in the SHU (hole) does not count as time served, and even if you only have a month of time to do, they can keep you indefinitely in solitary confinement in most states. 

Let me tell you, it is worse than being buried alive. If you are buried alive, you eventually die. In the SHU, they give you food and oxygen, but it is the same size as a coffin. I have been here for 10 years, no human contact. It is literally a closet with a ""cot"", in which I am too tall to actually lie down. I can't remember what it is like to sleep with my legs fully stretched out.

I keep pointing at my head and saying, ""Boom boom boom,"" and nothing happens. Fate is silly like that.";16181922320
Proceedings on the mandatory implementation of ocular masks. Grain entry SD Baxter-J9288;17;6;"The congressional hall was silent. 

“He can’t be serious, can he?” I smelled my assistant leaning over to whisper in my ear. The lemony salad he’d brought me for lunch was on *his* breath. I thought it had seemed a bit smaller than usual. Not that I could blame him, fresh veg was tough to come by. 

It had been a long week. Proposal after proposal each less promising than the last. We’d fought for the right to do this, but nobody had the data to back up their claims.

That is, until this man. 

We’d almost rejected his attendance, hell, I voted against it myself, but cooler, more logical heads prevailed. “We review the submissions on an unbiased and numerical basis.”

No room for reason when you have logic. 

“Just the idea of a mandatory implant…” a citrusy voice tickled my ear.

“Hush, just listen.”

It hadn’t been popular, but the ocular implant that was proposed wouldn’t be the first mandated. The interface grain had already made waves in the nation, bringing lower classes up-to-speed with their more fortunate peers. 

“This is what government is for, is it not?” The speaker gripped the podium trying to draw the whispers of inattention back to him. “You all collect here in this seat of governance to serve your people and to mandate the equalization of opportunity!”

The grain generation had already shown, had *proven*, that genetic makeup had little to do with cognitive ability. All minds in all classes, even those with what were once considered disordered or malfunctioning, fueled the prosperity of the nation to all new heights. Those unable to socialize in human interaction were often seen directing entire brigades. 

“If we know that our minds are equal, why then do we still quibble over our appearances? The beautiful still receive undue blessings, the ugly still withstand undue scorn.”

“But it wouldn’t work.” 

“Hush...” I *really* had to teach this new assistant to respect the silence edict during proceedings. “The numbers are about to show, you might be surprised.”

The charts appeared, colorful and well organized.

It was already popular on a voluntary basis. It was there in clear text. Even the ones who were new to the ocular interface and didn’t care for most of the other augs; they still showed an unconscious bias that preferred the masking. 

*We really are awful creatures, aren’t we?*

I had to. There’s be an outcry from my constitutes if I rejected a success dataset like this. 

“Congressperson Baxton?” The chairperson woke me from my musings.

“Your vote on the cultural unification mask?”

The end of tribalism. Would I miss it? I lifted the colored tag alongside my peers. Despite the cheery color of the thin plastic, the voting board felt heavy in my hand.

“The ayes have it.”

And that was it. The faces of those around me changed. In a blink, I was surrounded by a sea of muted homogeneity. 

Everyone was beautiful. But at that same time… nobody was.";16182302000

Even those so graciously born without one tout IT’s greatness.

Through the hall;17;2;"  

Darkness.

Cloth rubbed against my skin, clawed and tugged at my flesh. I peeked out from the pile at the still open door. I couldn’t close it in time, before-

Laughter, from the hall.

My thoughts ceased, my eyes pounding with the force of my heart’s beating. I pulled back into the closet, my back striking the wall with a thump. It was out there. It was-

A noise, dragging down the hall. Metal across wood, tearing up shards with the force of it’s passing. It moved from my parent’s room.

Into mine.

The laughter slowed in its pace. It slowed, and stopped. I heard it breathing, long panting as it struggled for breath. It struggled as the ferocity of its petulant tantrum destroyed my bed, tore at my sheets. It howled for long moments, crashing into the floor.

Its limbs struck the ceiling light in my room, its metal cracking the bulb and glass. The bulb shattered.

Darkness. The noises ceased.

My breath panted in my own ears. Tears warmed my cheeks as sweat pooled down my back, each a river. I gripped my pajama pants in my fists, unable to slow my rocking body.

“Child.”

My rocking stopped. The voice was still in my room, near where my bed had been. It now lay in splinters, visible only in the moonlight from my open window. The doorway into my bedroom was pulped, shredded with jagged gashes at shoulder height.

It wasn’t doing anything, now. I could hear something, but couldn’t figure it out. My mind was itching, each pulse of my heart sending knives through it.

My closet door opened, just out of sight from the doorway. The door struck the door jam, that had lay broken for so many years. Its noise was the only thing audible besides the roaring blood in my ears.

I heard crawling, limbs tipping and tapping as something entered my closet.

The door closed.

I suppressed a whimper, my eyes scrunched up. I-

A whisper. From behind me.

Cool metal against my neck.

Clatter!;26;0;"I had just turned seven when my parents decided to extend into the attic. I had three sisters, two older and one younger.

The builders arrive with their truck parked in the drive, cement mixer, hammers, panels and a radio blaring most of the day. It was exciting!

The staircase was now connected with access to the upstairs space that would become our bedroom. That’s when things started to happen.

The house was always dark at night with no lights left on for comfort. I thought it very strange to hear pots and pans clattering in the dead of night. I slipped out of bed to check what mom was doing in the kitchen so late.

I pushed the door open and peered into the dark room. The clattering stopped in an instant! I rushed back to bed and buried my head under the covers, heart racing out of my chest.

Nothing much happened until I moved into the new upstairs bedroom with my sisters. It was ‘always’ cold. Part of the attic was boarded off for storage. I was playing with a toy typewriter one summers evening as the sun cast an orange glow across the room. Something scuttled behind me. I looked over my shoulder as a green jacket slithered across my bed as if were alive, then dropped to the floor. 
I felt sick. 
Ran to the top of the stairs. 
The something slammed me in the small of my back.
I was somehow propelled down that staircase without touching a single rung!

I ran to the living-room and cried “a ghost!”
My bemused family looked at me as my dad bolted up the stairs. The room was icy cold.

There was something nasty and hateful lingering in that room. It visited mostly at nighttime. My bed was placed between my two sisters beds. There was always a warning this menacing spirits as going to visit. Firstly I’d hear a soft tingling sound, like distant wind chimes, then it would turn my stomach upside down. It was a really terrible almost painful feeling. I’d jump into my sisters bed and say ‘here it is again.’ We would hide until it passed.

My eldest sister suddenly pepped up one morning during breakfast that she had seen a man wearing a long cape with a peaked hood standing at the top of the stairs last night. She told mom she was really scared. He didn’t seem to have a face.

My mom put it down to a vivid imagination, but mentioned it to Mrs Blackburn, a friendly neighbour. She was quick to reply, “Well, it doesn’t surprise me. These houses were built on ancient gallows”. 

I couldn’t have been happier when we moved house. 

I still remember these events with great clarity!";16181886140

Targeted advertisements;240;9;"You come home from an awful day at work. An unthankful boss, rude coworkers, same as everyday.

When you reach down to pick it up your heart sinks. It’s you and your two siblings, who are now deceased, killed in a freak car crash a couple years back on their way to see you. Memories flood your mind for a moment. Back when you three used to go out camping in the woods for days on end, or back when you would all huddle around the living room fireplace and tell scary stories at midnight. Just the three of you out having a blast. A tear falls onto the picture. You set it down on the table and grab the radio. You turn on the radio and music plays for a second until some loud static, an ad starts.

The Other Place;1233;70;"I remember stewing in the rancid deathhole with my rotting family for days. You can’t imagine that stench. It’s unreal. Like nothing you’ll ever smell again in your life. I was so young, I wanna say maybe seven or eight, and I knew of nothing outside of that house. So I stayed. Lived with the decomposing shells of my mother, father and sister, like nothing had happened. Like it was just another day. Made them dinner. Carefully poured boiling tea down their black mouths. Brushed their teeth. 

Curled up all nice and tight in the squishy moistness of them at night.

They dragged me out of there, of course. Put me into the system. Therapy. Shrinks. Foster family after foster family. No one wants damaged goods, so I never stayed long in one place. I don’t blame them. I wouldn’t have cared for me either. 

After a year or two I couldn’t even remember it, you know. What had happened back there. Brainwashed. Or braincleaned I guess. I quickly realised something was missing inside of me, though. A vital piece, like a connection to parts of me long since submerged in murky darkness.

I think it was born from that vacuum. Something deep in the hidden parts of my being that thrived and grew in isolation. That’s the only way I can explain it, anyway. How I could step into the other place.

At first it didn’t register. They’re so similar, you know. Down to the very atom, it’s like a replica, or a twin I suppose, just slightly different. I just stepped out from my shitty apartment one particularly dark day, and I was there. In the other place. No event. No portal, or flashing lights, just a single step through an invisible membrane.

Moments later I was back again. But I saw things there. Things I couldn’t explain rationally, logically, emotionally. People that shouldn’t be. Places that shouldn’t exist. Hallucinations? I guess. That’s what I held onto for the first few times anyway. Hallucinations, or waking dreams, or something. Soon though, I wandered that world for weeks, months. Years?

Still I suppose I didn’t fully believe it until I saw *them*. 

My family. My mother, my father, my sister - exactly like I remembered them, still living in our old apartment - like they hadn’t aged a day. Memories came back to me then, in floods of pain and hurt, but also comfort and warmth. 

So I guess that’s why I’m here, surrounded by the soothing stench of your rotting carcasses once more. You succumbed to the poison much like you did the last time; in unimaginable waves of torment, screams, bodily liquids, and seizures. That missing piece, that vital connection, was suddenly back again. And for the first time in years, I felt whole.

And they’re not dragging me out this time, mother.

Only in Dreams;17;0;"I was walking down the street I grew up on. It had really gone downhill since I had lived here. There was crumbling masonry on every house and dead plants in every garden. One thing hadn’t changed though - people watching me from every window. Beady eyes protruding rudely from pale, emaciated faces tracing my every step, peeking out from behind twitching curtains. 

A whispering noise filled the air. They were talking about me, chattering behind closed doors in hushed, disapproving tones. I tried to cover my ears but it did no good. Their cruel words still found a way into my head. Deep, unsettling laughter suddenly broke out and I saw a grotesque old man with a bulbous head guffawing at me from one of the windows. Yelling at him to stop only made him laugh harder. He was almost doubled over, wheezing his ghastly chuckles at me. Why were people always laughing at me?! Picking up a chunk of stone that had fallen from one of the buildings, I hurled it through his window. 

It was then I realized that I was dreaming. The stone disappeared into thin air just as it was about to hit the glass and the mocking old man vanished with it. The only sign that I had thrown anything was the sound of shattering glass but with no stone actually hitting it the window apparently remained intact. Dreams can be crazy like that.

A figure approached me as I continued walking up the street. He was a strange man, dressed all in white and he began chiding me for breaking the window. “It isn’t broken though"" I said with no small amount of exasperation to him, gesturing towards the still-intact window. He didn’t like that at all and started grabbing at me. “This is my dream!” I yelled at him as I pushed him away. I grabbed at the air and felt my hand grasp the handle of a scalpel. Anything you can imagine can be found in a dream. I plunged it repeatedly into the man’s chest and in an instant he disappeared.

The whispering voices had broken out into harsh, demented yelling. People were leaving their homes and coming out to get me. They hated me. They always had. 

I retreated to my childhood home. The vile inhabitants of the street tried to block my way but I cleared a path with stabs and slices using the scalpel. I entered the house to find the bodies of mother, father and little sister Jane all arranged exactly as they had been on the night I had killed them. The knife wounds on them were still fresh, as if my savage attack had occurred just moments ago. In reality though decades had passed and I had been recovering well at the institution ever since. 

The only criticism the doctors still had was my tendency to retreat into a state of dream-like fantasy. Then, they said, I could become violent.";16181801840
Quiet On The Set;78;38;"The stench was overpowering. The corpses may have been kept in refrigerated storage until just moments ago, but it was cold comfort that it could be any worse. Marilu gagged and doubled over. ""*Oh*! Someone *do* something about this! Turn on the fans! Anything!""

Danny tried to look sympathetic. ""I know it's bad, but this is an indoors scene. A blowing wind wouldn't make any sense.""

Marilu pouted. ""How can they expect us to *work* like this? Can I get some more menthol for my lip, maybe?""

""You don't really want any more,"" Danny consoled. ""It opens up the nasal passages and makes the smell seem even worse.""

""But why do they have to be actually *dead*?"" Marilu whined. ""Why can't we use unknown actors, trying to break into the business, like we did in the old days?""

Danny shushed her with a fearful look. ""Careful. The crew have ears."" And he was right; Marilu scanned the room to see the crew members glaring hotly at her, each looking deeply offended.

""Really?"" Marilu complained. ""We have to portray dead people using *actual* dead people, in the interests of fairness?""

""That's how it works these days,"" Danny commiserated. ""It's all about equality, by any means necessary.""

She turned to the nearest crew member. ""Are you telling me the smell doesn't bother you?""

""*I* don't smell anything,"" the crew member quickly retorted. His watering eyes told a different story.

Marilu groaned. ""And this isn't even the worst of it! Who decided that the criminals portrayed on this show had to be *actual* criminals?""

""Also in the interests of fairness and equality,"" Danny pointed out.

""But it's not *safe*!"" Marilu protested. ""Yesterday's perp was using live ammo! I barely escaped with my life!""

""He missed, didn't he?"" Danny smirked. ""The screaming passersby sure contributed to the scene's realism, didn't they? The director sure seemed to like it!"" The director gave him a thumbs-up, his smile beaming.

Marilu cowered. ""Then later that night, he robbed me as I was walking to my car! He used the same loaded gun he had on set! The security guards did *nothing*!""

Danny demurred. ""*You* know they're not allowed to be armed. Besides, you undoubtedly have more money than he does. You can spare a little of that for someone less fortunate, can't you?""

A crashing sound nearby broke the silence. Angry guffaws, insane howling, glasses shattering and tables overturning. The director stormed off to deal with the noise. Marilu sulked. ""It's the psycho for the next scene, isn't it? We *really* have to use an actual psycho?""

Danny suddenly became strident. ""Hey, we're *lucky* to be working in this business. There are *hundreds* that would willingly take your place. You need to appreciate how privileged you are just to *be* here!"" The director returned, muttering angrily under his breath. ""Now let's shoot this scene already."" The crew gasped; some began crying. ""*Film*! I mean *film* this scene!""

Our first cat named mom;84;6;"Growing up we were the only family that didn’t have any pets.  Not even a goldfish. 

About once a week me or my older sister, Emily would ask our mother for a pet and she would say “I don’t care go ask your Father!”

Then we would say “Dad can we please get a cat or dog?”

My dad, who was garbageman by trade would always pause for a moment to seem like he was carefully considering our question but the response was always “No, because with me and your mother always working no one has time to take care of a pet.”

Then shortly after I graduated high school mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and she died within a year.

Mom’s death brought our family a lot of grief and sorrow with me and Emily still in college and dad still having 10 years before he could retire.  Dad really turned into a hot mess where he gained 50 pounds and would eat nothing more than a TV dinner every night.

So I reluctantly made my way home for Christmas break, but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to the house which looked just as good when mom was still alive and there was no foul odors.  About 10 minutes later, Emily showed up and she was equally as surprised as me by the appearance of the house.

As nice as the house looked, the biggest shocker came when we saw a young orange cat scurrying around the house.  Emily said “Oh my Gosh dad, you got a cat!”

My dad was cleaning the kitchen and stopped for a minute and said “Yeah, one day I got home from work and she was sitting by the front door and she wouldn’t go away so rather than take her to the ASPCA where they may have put her down, so I just let the cat stay here.”

Emily and I were shocked but the cat seemed to keep dad occupied so we were both happy dad kept the cat.

Dad cooked for the three of us then we all watched TV then we went upstairs and went to bed.

I was used to being up all night partying, so the cat making all kinds of noise downstairs peaked my curiosity where I went to see if it was chasing a mouse.

So I sat on the top of the stairs  and I was so shocked that I  had to squint my eyes like 20 times because I saw something completely bizarre and amazing at the same time.  The cat was actually doing human housekeeping chores by dragging the iron then ironing dad’s clothes and the cat was carrying trash in it’s mouth then throwing it away.

The cat came close to the stairs dragging one of dad’s work pants where it must of seen me and looked up where we both locked eyes on each other and something inside of me said “Mom; Is that you?”";16181333360
On the Beauty of Eyes;52;9;"She doesn’t recognize me anymore. Of course she doesn’t. But I remember her. I remember the things she made me do.

She’s here to get contact lenses. Rigid gas permeable lenses, to be exact. They’re hard lenses, the kind you put on at night and take out in the morning. 

I get her to take a seat, ask her the usual questions. Then I get out the case with the lenses. She puts the right lens in first. 

“Close your eyes.” She obeys. (How funny. I used to be the one who always obeyed.)

“Do you remember me?” I ask. (I already know what her response will be.)

“Remember you? I’ve never even met you before.”

I take my thumb and press it against her eye until the sharp edges dig into her cornea.

“Do you remember me now?”

“What are you doing? You’re crazy! Stop! I’m going to report you!” she threatens.

I push harder.

“TAKE IT OUT!” she screams, clawing at her eye.

(One more chance to forgive.)

The eye is such a beautiful organ. Not because of all that shit about eyes being “windows to the soul.” The eye is beautiful because it’s so delicate, so easy to injure. Its beauty lies in its fragility.

“Sure thing,” I say. I grab my Wells Enucleation Spoon from the cabinet of surgical tools. In one swift motion, I scoop out her right eye, tugging to disconnect the optic nerve.

I ignore her screaming and examine what I have taken from her, rolling it around in my hand. I observe the intricate crisscrossing veins, the gentle curve of the cornea, the vibrant colors of the iris. So beautiful. It twitches for a moment, then is still.

“All better. Do you want to try the other lens now?”";16181397200
My Roommate was not Human;49;4;"I had just graduated college, I was a major in psychology. After graduating finding a job and a place to live had been a struggle. I had grown tired of living in my parents basement, and they were tired of me as well. ""Anthony,"" My dad had said, ""Your mother and I have put the house up for sale, we need you to be out in a month."" 

I had applied to a couple of apartments to no avail, I ended up making a post about needing a place to crash on Craigslist. After 3 or 4 days I got a message from someone named Daniel. He said that he had a room available as his old roommate had left. I immediately jumped on the opportunity, he said I could move in at the end of the week, and we'd discuss rent whenever I arrived. So on Friday, I packed what little belongings I had into my beat up old car and made my way to the outskirts of town, to the address Daniel had sent to me.

It was a small house that seemed to be falling off its foundation, the house was creepy itself. Algae covered it, and I had now realized why he hadn't sent me photos. I grabbed my bags and walked up to the front door. I was just about to knock when the door swung open. Daniel was a young looking man, probably just a few years older then me, he smiled kindly. His eyes were off, but I didn't think much of it. He helped me carry my bags inside. As I set them down in the small sad living area, which consisted of a single arm chair, and a TV stand with no TV I turned back to face him.

""So how much do I ow-"" I began to say, but my gasp of horror washed the thought away. Daniel was floating, his eyes were blood red, his fangs were large and pointy. His skin was scaly and pale. It was horrifying. 

""This is payment enough!"" He lunged at me, I dodged his attack and fell backwards. My grandmother had warned me of bloodsuckers before her untimely death 6 years prior. I always took everything she said with such importance. I fumbled around in my pocket for the good luck charm she had given to me on her death bed. It was a stone with a special enchantment sealed inside, said to repel all evil things. Daniel shrieked as I held it out, still on the ground with my eyes closed.

 I looked up just in time to see him explode like a firework. I breathed a sigh of relief. I was safe from the bloodsuckers for another night. Anyways, that happened about 6 months ago. So if anyone is looking for a roommate please message me. I don't bite.";16181328250
The Sculptor;166;13;"“Thank you so much for this opportunity, Ms. Theno,” Shelley said.

“Don’t mention it, dear,” the older woman replied, smiling. “And please, call me Madelyn.”

The two walked through the halls of Madelyn Theno’s countryside estate. The walls were lined with beautiful landscape paintings and shelves that held priceless antique vases; a fitting decor for a world-renowned sculptor. Madelyn herself was a tall and pale-skinned woman who carried herself with an air of grace and dignity. Shelley wasn’t sure why Madelyn needed to wear a long coat, headscarf and sunglasses in the privacy of her own home, but didn’t question it. All artists had their quirks, after all.

“The moment I saw your portfolio, I *knew* you’d be the perfect subject for my next work.” Madelyn looked Shelley up and down. “And now that I see you in person, I’m more sure than ever. Yes, you will be my finest creation yet.”

Shelley beamed with pride. “I can’t wait to see how it turns out!”

“I’m sure you won’t be disappointed.” The two came to a stop in front of a large oak door. “Well, here’s where the magic happens. Shall we?”

Madelyn’s studio was much like others Shelley had seen: a spacious room with high-powered lights set up to face a pure white backdrop. Shelley assumed Madelyn would be taking dozens of photos to use as a reference for her sculpture.

“You’ll find your outfit behind that screen over there,” Madelyn said, motioning towards an opaque folding screen set up in the far corner of the room. “Go get changed while I get the lights set up.”

A few minutes later Shelley stepped out from behind the screen, clad in a beautiful silk gown that hugged her body. Madelyn, who had been positioning the lights, turned at the sound of approaching footsteps.

“You look stunning, my deart!” Madelyn said with a wide grin, clasping her hands. “We’re ready to begin.”

Shelley took her place in front of the backdrop, the lights fixing her with their illuminating gaze. The next several minutes were spent getting Shelley into position. She followed Madelyn’s precise instructions, allowing the artist to move her body as needed. Madelyn worked diligently; the hair had to be just right, the arms had to be bent at the perfect angle, every fold and crevice in the dress had to be to her exact specifications.

Finally Madelyn stepped back. Shelley knelt on the floor before her, hands clasped together as if in prayer, head turned up towards the heavens.

“Yes… yes, it’s finally perfect,” Madelyn said. Her grin was almost manic as she looked down at Shelley. “Are you ready, my dear?”

“I am,” Shelley replied, taking care not to move her head a single millimeter. “So, where’s your camera anyways?”

Madelyn didn’t reply.

Instead she reached up, tearing off her headscarf and sunglasses.

The last thing Shelley saw was Madelyn’s hair writhing and twisting, and a pair of yellow reptilian eyes staring into hers.";16181085940
Knocking.;60;2;"Knocking.

&#x200B;

Sitting in my room, hoping it stops. It continues, however, for a while. Whatever is knocking is calling my name. The babysitter left to drink with her friends, so 11-year-old me called my parents to have them rush home. They're about an hour away. So, I investigated. 

&#x200B;

I left my room, and to my surprise, my aunt had come to visit. I haven't seen her in years, so this was a good kind of surprise. We played checkers for a while until she entered the bathroom and didn't come out for a while. I thought we were playing hide and seek, so, I seek. 

&#x200B;

She kept dropping hints. Whistling, knocking, and the occasional laugh. I almost found her a while, but when I would approach the area of the noise, it stopped and it would be behind me. She must've been using her phone to play these noises. 

&#x200B;

I went upstairs and heard the noises in my closet. As I was about to open it, I hear:

&#x200B;

""Savannah! We're home!""

&#x200B;

Yay! mom and dad are home!

&#x200B;

I rush down to see them and give them hugs.

&#x200B;

""Hey, help me find Aunt Sandra! I think she's in my closet. She's good at this! 

&#x200B;

""What do you mean?"" My dad says.

&#x200B;

""You called her to come over, right? She came over right after I called you guys.""

&#x200B;

""Savannah... She's been dead for two years.""

&#x200B;

""Then who's in my closet?"" I say, confused. 

&#x200B;

We went up to check, and nothing was found. By them, at least.

&#x200B;

Sandra was standing behind them, her finger over her pursed lips. 

&#x200B;

They left, and it started again.

&#x200B;

Knocking. 

&#x200B;

I investigated once again. She was outside of my room, finger once again over her lips.

&#x200B;

She led me to my parents room. She pointed at them, and I knew what had to be done. The last time my parents called my aunt, she was never seen again. Now, she wanted revenge. 

&#x200B;

I lived with my grandparents after our house burned down. A shame, really. 

&#x200B;

I just wish I could've survived the fire.";16181275440
The Noises;145;13;"Hello, my name is David. Or is it Danny? It’s getting harder to tell nowadays. I live on 36 russel street. Or is it 63?

I sometimes hear voices in my head. Stuff like “we love you” or “how’s he doing?” But I try to ignore them. It’s not too hard to.

The worst is the beeping. Constant in my ears. It never stops. Never changes. It’s just always there.

The weirdest thing happened yesterday. Or was it three days ago? Time is hard to tell now. I felt a pain in my chest and the beeping went to a solid sound. I heard shuffling and crying, but it eventually returned to normal.

But now I hear the worst things. It sounds like… my family. They say stuff that shatters my perception on this reality.

“Damn it david, you’ve been in a coma for three years! Just die! We can’t afford you anymore!”";16181083920
Be original joe;18;2;"Joe is never original and is always copying me and doing things the way I do them. It's really irritating and I just wish that he would do his own thing and go on his own adventure in life. Joe always seems to copy me though and it really irritates me and it's also kind of creepy. Joe is not a bad guy but I guess that he just likes copying my fashion and the way I move and talk. I had a talk with Joe about this copying thing and he told me that whenever he is accidentally copying me, I should just tell him and he will do anything to stop copying me. 

The other day when he came to the pub I told him that he has the same hair as me and it was literally identical. The hair colour was the same, the length of the hair was the same and even the curly texture was the same. Joe went away and chopped it off and came back into the pub. I thanked him and Joe said sorry for accidentally copying me but he did try to make excuses though, that he wasn't exactly copying me as it was his natural hair, but I disagreed. 

The next time I met Joe was at the park and there was a football event on and I noticed that Joe had the exact same ears as me. I went up to Joe and told him that he was copying me by having the exact same identical ears as mine. Joe apologised and chopped both his ears off and I thanked him for not copying me anymore. I gave advice to Joe to be more original and that he needs to walk his own path. 

I then met Joe at some party and I noticed that Joe had the same exact nose as mine this time, and I told him that he needed to stop copying me. Joe apologised and managed to get his nose chopped off and I have no idea how he did it but I thanked him for not copying me anymore. I was beginning to lose my patience in general and I didn't know what to say to him anymore and Joe promised me that he will never copy me ever again. That was a complete lie when I met Joe again at some charity event and his whole head was copying mine. Joe apologised and shot himself through the head. 

Just be original Joe.";16181428740
G-Day;333;10;"As the words SIMULATION FAILED flash on screen, I unbuckle from my chair and float around for a while. On the calendar pinned to the ceiling, I've drawn a circle around today's date. Beside it, I’ve scribbled ‘Seventh anniversary of G-Day’.

I pinch the bridge of my nose and groan. Seven years. Damn. I’ve been trying to fix this mess for seven years now and what do I have to show for it? Nothing.

Actually, that’s not true: I’ve got a wife on the verge of kicking my ass to the curb.

I reach out, switch off the computer, and sigh with relief. If you’ll pardon the pun, it’s like a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

I press both feet against the wall and kick myself toward the door. The stairway I drift into is full of junk and old wooden boxes. I travel past them.

When I float into the kitchen, my daughter, Jenny, launches herself towards me like a torpedo. She collides with my chest, sending us spiraling across the room.

“Hi darling,” I kiss her forehead. “Go get ready, we’ll stop by the park on the way to the memorial service.”

She cheers then heads towards her room.

My wife holds herself in place behind the kitchen counter, frowning. “Nice of you to stop by from time to time.”

She glances at the floor. “Look, I’ve been thinking—”

“Please, don’t speak, just listen,” I reach across the counter and clasp her hand. “I know I’ve been neglecting you—both of you—lately but…I thought I could fix things. It’s just, every time I think about The Belt it makes me—”

She slouches back. 

“—But now I realize that’s not important. The two of you—that’s what’s important. Please don’t say anything else, at least for now. Just give me one more chance. Things will be different. I promise.”

Before she can reply, my daughter bursts into the room. “Can we go now?”

My wife hesitates for a moment. “OK.”

The three of us clip together—Jenny in the middle—and make our way outside. There, I hook onto the neighborhood’s cable network and hoist us along. We follow an upward-sloping cord towards the city, stopping at the park along the way. The memorial service has already begun by the time we reach our destination.

We join countless others paying tribute to those who lost their lives on G-Day. To those unfortunate enough to be outdoors when my team powered on the reactor seven years ago. It still gives me chills thinking about them trapped up there in The Belt, coating the planet in a thick blanket of decomposing debris. 

My wife notices my quivering lip and squeezes my hand. I smile at her.

I’d hoped to ease my guilt by restoring Earth’s gravitational field, but it’s time to accept there’s nothing I can do.

It’s time to leave behind the mistakes of the past and focus on the future.

I asked my little sister if she wants to play hide and seek;77;9;"She nods in excitement. 

""I'll be counting to 50 okay? And whatever you do, don't come out until I find you okay?""

""Okay!"" She said as she runs off to the other side of the house

""1.. 2.... 3.......-"" I counted loudly, then stopped as the footsteps of my sister disappeared. Confirming that she wasn't near, I looked around and quickly ran into the kitchen. Taking a knife from the top cabinet.

As I got the knife and turned around.

I was stabbed, I didn't have time to react as my body flopped down. The perpetrator hovered over me. Smiling down on me. 

He took my knife away and stabbed me with his knife once more


""Wish you hid as well"" He said as his knife got closer to my face";16181094760
Tell me if it Hurts;32;3;"Once again I find myself in the dentists reclining chair under the blinding light. 

The new dentist points to an x-ray “See that foggy spot? It’s a cavity in your molar. You haven’t been flossing enough.”

I have never flossed enough and I never see the foggy spot that they see.

“We are going to have to use stronger anesthetic and a ‘mouth prop’.” She showed me some sort of brace that seemed designed to keep me from biting down.

I nodded. I hate the dentist and I just wanted to get this done as soon as possible so I kept my eyes closed as she gave me the shot in my gums and put the brace in.

I felt my face begin to numb and I didn’t know if I could close my jaw at this point even if I wanted to. 

She wheeled over a tray of tools and it felt like there were more on it than usual. 

“I’m going to give it a few more minutes to make sure the numbing agent has taken hold, then we will begin.” 

With the light overhead I couldn’t keep my eyes open and at this point I couldn’t speak so I tried to nod but I felt weak.

Something was off. 

I tried to raise my hand but all that lifted was a finger. 

“Ah we are good to start then.” There was something malicious in her voice, something evil.

I tried to shake my head but it didn’t move. My eyes just darted frantically.

“Don’t panic, just tell me if it hurts.”

And she started drilling. Whatever she gave me disabled my muscles but did nothing to stop the pain. 

I felt the drill bite in deeper and deeper before she pulled her pick and knife from the table.

There were cuts and prying for what felt like an eternity before a sickening suction sound came from my mouth followed shortly by something distinctively hard hit the inside of a metal pan.

“Oops wrong tooth.” She said almost in a sing song voice while suctioning the blood from my gurgling mouth. 

The pain was almost unimaginable. It felt like my head was being torn in half and that is when she started on the next tooth.

It was four hours before she stopped. She had removed thirty-one teeth in total. She left me with hastily stitched gums and just the single tooth she showed me in the x-ray.";16181167170
Unrequited;69;4;"I was woken by my phone ringing. I looked at the time, it was 3:03 a.m.

""Who the hell is calling this late?""

I looked at the phone. It was Rachel. Of course it would be her. She must be drunk calling me again. I had half a mind to put the phone on silent and go to sleep. I didn't want to listen to her incoherent drunk nonsense again. But I was worried she might be in some trouble again. I was 1000 miles away from her, wouldn't even be able to go and help her.

I ultimately picked up the call.

""H-h-heyyyyyy!!! Guessss where am I."" She slurred and my sleepy mind somehow made sense of that.

""Obviously a bar. And You are drunk, so just go home please.""

""I misss you. I missss uss. Whyy dontya misss me?""

She kept repeating this while I tried to convince her to go home. In the end I realised the futility of this and cut the call. ""At least she is not in any trouble. She is drunk but she will reach home."" I thought.  She keeps doing this.

I realised she won't stop calling me now and I won't be able to sleep. Keeping the phone on silent seemed like the wise choice and I did just that.

But sleep was miles away now. I kept thinking about her. About my relationship with her. About  how it started and how it ended. We had good times. She was sweet but she was obsessive. I had heard rumours about her crazy behaviour but never really encountered it myself. I just saw her obsession with me, which was getting really suffocating for me. So, I had to breakup with her. But now seeing her unravelling this way, drunk calling me every now and then, it made me feel really sorry for her.

I kept thinking about her and fell asleep soon.

I woke up with the alarm at 7 a.m.. I reached for the phone, expecting dozens of messages and missed calls from her. But to my surprise there were none. This was really unusual. I was concerned now.

Wait. I have a Insta notification from her profile. She posted something on Insta at 6:30 a.m.

My concern evaporated and a chilling fear took place.

It was a photo of her. On my bed. Lying beside me.

A chill went through my spine when I realised that my clothes in the photo were the same as what I was wearing right then.";16181034900
Tommy's Boogeyman;80;6;"""Mummah.""
I let out a frustrated sigh as I rolled over and forced my eyes open a sliver. Tommy was standing in the door, looking white as a ghost and eyes wide as saucers. He had seen the boogeyman again. 
""Yes, sweetie?"" I said as I fumbled for my glasses in the dark, being careful not to wake my husband. The boogeyman stuff annoyed me but it really seemed to send him through the roof lately. In fact, just before bed, I had to give him the business about raising his voice at the poor kid over it. 
""Can I have a glass of water?"" The request was certainly not what I had expected. A pleasant break from our new nightly routine (though I had my suspicions). I stood up and snuck over to the him, closing my bedroom door behind me. 
""Can Daddy come get it with us?"" he quickly threw in as the door clicked shut. ""No silly."" I said with a little chuckle. His face went from concerned to an urgent distress. Tears began to form in the corner of his eyes. 
This had to be the boogeyman thing. I got down on a knee and looked him in the eyes. ""Tommy, did you see the boogeyman?"" He nodded quickly. ""Do you want me to check your room?""
He shook his head which loosened the tears and sent them rolling down his cheeks. 
""Its okay,"" I assured him. It my not have been right but I couldn't bare to see my little boy so upset. He shook his head again. ""Why not?"" I asked. He looked me square in the eyes and whisered, ""because he's in your room!"" 

Suddenly my husband let out a scream from the other side of the door! I threw it open to see what happened and froze! Nobody was in there. Not the boogeyman, not my husband, nobody. The window was wide open, and a trail of blood ran from where he was sound asleep moments ago, across the carpet, up the wall, and out into the darkness...";16180996070
The Beast Behind Me;21;6;"(Estradiol) 

&#x200B;

It’s behind me right now.

Impossible for a person, but what I’m dealing with isn’t a *fucking* person.

Far fucking from it. It’s a shadow creature, it follows me everywhere.

I don’t think anyone can see it. Sometimes in a hoodie and a beard. Sometimes a dress that matches mine.

That’s not true.

I’m sure some people can.

I see it in their faces. Their eyes squinted, their lips pulled back, noses wrinkled. Small notions of disgust render the truth in front of me.

They can see it, forever fucking following, just *this* close behind.

It looks just like me, but for it’s mangled limbs. Twisted and misshapen arms lumbering as we walk in lockstep. It’s rotten teeth, and Five'o'Clock Shadow.

*Don’t we look so cute* girl *just like twins you and I! You shouldn’t wear dresses. You’re not that kind of* girl, *are you?*

*This is what* you’d *look like. If you had the* balls *to put on a face, like a* proper girl, *hmm?*

It croons at me like this daily, today in a stained sundress. Thick foundation smeared across blotchy skin. Its nicotine stained teeth chattering in my ear, ragged breaths between awful lies spew stench into my nostrils. It's Five'o'Clock Shadow cutting pinpricks in my face.

My own personal demon, whispering sweet nothings to me.

*They can tell, they can all tell! Nothing you do can change it!*

*They all see ME*

I’ve been staring at The Pill in my hand for an hour now, asking myself.

*Is it worth it? What if The Beast is right?*

It whispers to me, fear and anger quaking its voice as the tablet passes my lips. A growing occurrence since I started The Pill.

*If you take it you’ll turn into ME! DON'T TAKE IT!*

It’s swallowed now, and The Beast Behind Me is gone.

As long as I take The Pill, I can’t hear The Beast any more. I can't *see it.*

I can still see that others see it, though.

Or at least, I hope they do.

High Tide;1487;30;"When Sarah was seven her mother died in her sleep. She rang me to tell me that Mummy was a funny colour and wouldn't wake up. I drove round and found Sarah in the kitchen eating cornflakes. She said she was hungry.

After the funeral, Sarah came to live with me in a small but clean cottage, on the other side of the river near the island bridge.

The bridge was unusable twice a day during high tide, and on certain days it would be submerged completely.

All things considered, life went on and went on well. We would go for walks along the coast collecting oyster shells. Sometimes, we noticed fossils protruding from eroded cliffs.

One morning, I went to wake Sarah for school. She wasn't there. As I went to look for her, I saw her out of the window. She was stuck in the middle of the bridge, having climbed the railings to escape the rising tide. I ran outside, half-naked.

I waded out to the bridge. I could hear her frightened screams.

When I reached her, the tide had risen and the current was making me unsteady.

I picked Sarah up and hugged her. She'd had a dream mummy was waiting for her back at the old house.

We started to make our way back when I noticed the waves in front of us. They were getting more forceful. I gripped the railing and put Sarah on my shoulders.

I told Sarah to hold on and not let go. The water was now past my waist.

As I went to move, I saw the first jellyfish drift past me.

One brushed my leg and I flinched. Sarah wobbled but then steadied herself. We were crying out for help but there was nobody else around.

I could barely move with the ferocity of the current and held onto Sarah with one hand and the railing the other.

Then I was stung. I swore as I felt tentacles graze my leg. The pain was acidic and polluting.

Another came by. The waters were above my chest and I raised Sarah up slightly so her feet weren't in the water.

A smack of jellyfish then collided with me and attacked me. The venom painted my skin and I yelled out, tears forming. My body was going numb from the cold and the poison.

The tide wasn't due to recede for another five minutes. Time slowed as I was stung and cajoled. Sarah was upset at how much pain I was in.

Eventually, the tide fell and the current slowed. I went to get Sarah down so we could go home.

She wasn't there. She never was.

I didn't reach her in time that cruel December morning four years ago. I had watched helplessly through the window as the current swallowed my little girl. So every high tide I wade out and let the jellyfish punish me for not being there when she needed me.

It's all I can do.";16180392710
Every time I am reincarnated, the umbilical cord strangles me as I come out.;104;4;" I know I am just a baby, but I feel so very old, and so very tired. I've heard those gurgling sounds a thousand times. I've heard those excited muffled voices so many times. I've heard the frantic, happy call that the baby is coming so many times. A few times I've even seen the shocked faces of my mum looking at me in my last moments.

I think he hit her again. It has happened many times in my long existence. She falls and I bounce, the water around me protects me. This time it's different. A knife breaks in and almost stabs me. The water drains. The knife grinds.

Soon, calloused, rough hands take me out. I cry as he roughly hacks off my food supply. It's the first time I see the world. It's rough, dusty, hot. Someone is screaming. People are crying.

His face looks stern, but I fall in love. Papa. 

My memory is quickly fading, but I look around at the world and the crying people and understand that it will be my mission to fix it. Humans are weak and they need a leader who is not afraid to do what is neccessary. Just like my Papa.

My memory fades, and I become indistinguishable from any other baby.";16180905150
A Friend to the End;39;7;"“Would you like some water?” My best friend in the world rouses me from my semi-conscious state. He gently takes a cup from the bedside tray and holds it up to my lips. Sweet, ice-cold water refreshes my parched tongue and throat. He smiles as he replaces the cup, then fixes me with his usual warm and comforting gaze. In his calm, peaceful eyes I can feel the pain lessen considerably; replaced by a soothing sleepiness. 

Although my memory isn’t what it used to be, I can remember it wasn’t always this way. In fact, when we first at the local park—*restaurant? theater?*--it was him who needed my help. He was so weak he could barely walk; his unsteady steps aided by an old, gnarled walking stick. I remember lending a hand to help as he struggled to rise from his seat. I was much more healthy back then, all those years—*months? weeks?*--ago. We found that we had so many interests in common, such as…such as… It doesn’t matter; it’s so hard to think. 

At any rate, from that moment on, we met daily at the park for walks. I’d patiently stroll beside him, lending an arm when needed. We had long, intriguing conversations about almost any topic, and the time would just fly by. It wasn’t long before his pace began to match my own on these walks, and the stick became a thing of the past, collecting dust in the corner of my foyer. That’s right, in MY foyer. We got along so famously that he moved in with me a couple months--*weeks? days?*--ago. Now, we never need be apart. 

Of course there was jealousy from my other friends and family. “You’re spending too much time with that guy,” they would say. “We don’t like the changes we’re seeing in you.” I think that’s what they said. It was something like that, but I didn’t care, though. I’ve always felt so much comfort and relief when I’m with him. One by one, my former, fake friends and uncaring family members all left. *Did I—we?—push them away?* Good riddance to that negativity, I thought. Besides, as time went on, I didn’t have the energy to deal with them. 

It was around then that the sickness began to show up. Fortunately, my friend was much stronger now and able to take care of me. The fatigue was sporadic at first, but progressed rapidly with the passing of weeks…*days? hours?* Doctors were useless. “It’s just exhaustion and some dehydration,” they said. “Get some rest.” At least I think they did. No, I’m sure of it.

His syrupy sweet voice breaks my train of thought. 

“Carson…it’s time for me to go.”

*Go where, friend?* I’m unable to speak.

“Not much time left now, Carson.”

*Such a soothing voice. I’m floating away…*

“—you’ve no energy to spare me—”

“—been a good two weeks—”

“—will find a new friend—""

The Diner;2;1;"It was a nice, summer day. I decide to go pickup my two friends so we can hang out and grab a bite to eat later. We arrive at my house and we turn on the tv. Currently on the tv is a news report. It went like this 

“We have been getting reports that a fifth body has been found in the Waterhill area. The identity of the killer is not known at the time. However, we do know that the killer likes to use a butchers knife with a vibrant green handle. Be on the look out, and stay safe” 

“Damn. That’s crazy. But how do they know what his knife looks like?” My friend Nevan asks puzzled

“Fuck if I know. Let’s go get some food.” My other friend Damien says in a hurry 

We arrive at this 60s type diner in the country side of our little town. We get out of the car and walk inside. We all order burgers. 

We pay for our stuff and sit down to wait

“So who do you guys think the killer could be?” Damien asks

“I have my bets on it being Donovan” Nevan says while deep in thought

“Enjoy yall!” the owner says setting down our stuff

“Thanks Edna!”

We eat our food and stuff and we leave the diner. In the parking lot my friends start arguing. 

“Now I don’t understand why you can’t just stay out of my business. It’s not you fucking place to change shit” Damien snaps 

“I’ll do whatever the fuck I want you short bitch” Nevan retorts

Damien swings and hit Nevan square in the nose. They tackle each other to the ground and punch the shit out of each other. Then, Damien pulls out the killers signature knife and stabs Nevan to death. Damien looks at me and rushes at me. He raises his knife and stabs me SIDEWAYS through my hand. He then runs off, never to be seen again. 

And then I woke up. Right next to Damien. It was just a dream. 

“Stay. Out. Of. My. Business.”";16181575510
Is It Just Me?;5;0;"Sometimes I see people in the shadows. I don’t even know if they are real. Are they invisible? Are they ghosts? Or, most likely, I’m just seeing things. Things that aren’t there.
I should try to ignore it. I should stop waving and saying hi. I should probably just stop looking at them altogether. I shouldn’t make eye contact. Because if they are ghosts, they wouldn’t want me looking at them. They wouldn’t want me disturbing them. I’m sure you’re trying to figure out what I’m talking about. So am I. Sometimes, when I look at far-away objects, I see a ghost. A person. The person is always hooded. When I blink, they are gone. So I try not to blink. The people are always standing alone. Yes, I could very easily be going insane. Actually, I most likely am. I could just be imagining things. People. Ghosts. Or, maybe these people are trapped in some other world. A world that only I can see. Or, maybe it’s not just me. Maybe everyone can see them, I’m just the only one willing to talk about it.";16181148730

Big Boy Toys;76;12;"Timothy stood behind the grandfather clock in the hallway, waiting for his daddy to leave the home office. His blanket wrapped around his body, covering everything but his eyes; he knew he was totally invisible. Finally, dad shuffled out, along the hall, and down the stairway. This was his chance! Timothy sneaked into daddy's office, where he kept his big-boy toys, the ones Timothy wasn't allowed to play with. That just made him want to play with them even more.

So many bright, colorful shapes on the three monitors of daddy's computer! "";l;;gmlxzssaw"", Timothy burbled as he banged away on the keyboard. He squealed with joy; lots of new flashing colors! And even a buzzer! He wasn't good at reading yet, but could make out ""Nuclear missiles armed""; finally, some big boy toys! He giggled and clapped, then moved the mouse around the screen, clicking wildly. Even *more* bright red boxes! A new one that said ""Total release authorized""!

He squinted, annoyed: there was too much red. A new box popped up; it had a red button and a green button. He wanted more green! He clicked it with the mouse. Timothy's reward was a bigger box with lots of green; it said ""Emergency Alert System"" and ""All-Clear Sent"". Suddenly, all the boxes disappeared, and he saw a big map of the United States; slowly, happy-looking gray worms began squiggling out of the ground! So much fun to be had! No wonder Daddy kept it all to himself!

He heard footsteps. Daddy was returning! He bounded across the room and behind a big chair, covering himself again with the blanket. Daddy entered, saw his screens, and yelled some words Timothy once heard the plumber use. The phone rang; Timothy was sad he didn't get a chance to play with the big red handset. He wondered why it liked daddy more. So many words, such fast talking. ""Failsafe designed by the lowest bidder""...he agreed a fail would have to stay safe. ""Enemy submarines have fired MIRVs""...he wondered who Merv was.

Daddy threw down the phone and stomped out of the room. ""Timothy? Where are you? We have to get out of here *right now*!"" He stood still, not moving, hardly daring to breathe. Daddy *still* hadn't seen him! Wouldn't *he* be proud of how good he was at the hiding game! Timothy let a small giggle slip, but Daddy was far away now, crying Timothy's name loudly.

From outside rose a low sound, like a giant robot singing. It rose and fell, rose and fell. Such beautiful music! Timothy wanted to waltz around the room to it, but stayed where he was. The people outside sang along, a lot of short high notes, some really long ones too, but just singing ""aaaaa"". Maybe they didn't know the words.

Timothy saw a gray line in the sky, but this one didn't squiggle. Suddenly there was a bright light; he thought it was the prettiest light he'd ever seen in his life.";16180522500
Everyone is nice until you get to know them;30;2;"Majority of people are really nice until you get to know them and you have some who are just themselves all of the times. You could meet someone who was nice at first but then turns out that person is horrible after you get to know them. I prefer people who are just themselves all of the times, even if they are an asshole at least there will be no surprises. I practice at not getting to know people properly and that way everyone is just nice all of the times. I live in a residential building and I haven't really gotten to know anyone on purpose and everyone is nice and it's generally just the small talk of greeting and making small jokes. I mean you could be friendly with someone but as soon as you live with them, they are completely different. 

This one guy seemed to have gotten impatient with the small talks and me not getting to know him properly. He came up to me one day asking me whether I would like to know him more properly because he is sick of being nice but I refused. I could tell my refusal was a nuisance to him but he smiled and went his way. He then caught up with me on another day and begged me at getting to know him better because he is sick and tired of all the small niceties and he cannot stand it. He wants to show me his messed up world of dead animals and horrible nature to everyone. 

I refused again and I could tell even more so that me not wanting to know him was really hurting him, and he couldn't take being nice and friendly anymore. He wanted to show the number of people he has disabled, he wanted to show me his jars full of blood and he wanted to show me how much hatred he has for everyone. I refused nicely again which hurt him badly and he really didn't want to be nice anymore and was desperate in getting to know me. He knows everyone else in the residential building. 

I then told him that he could get to know me first and when I allowed him into my apartment, I then shot him in the head. He really shouldn't have gotten to know me that well.";16180562950
Scratching;13;0;"Around the time I started university I stayed in a shoddy student-let property just off-campus, and every night I'd hear a slow scraping sound coming from low down in the drywall.

For the first two days I just passed it off as pipes cooling because I couldn't think of anything else. Rats weren't an unlikely cause probably given the rundown condition of the place, but rats made scuttling sounds. This was different.

I lost count of how many times I held my ear to that wall, trying and failing to figure it out and being left with frustration and a nagging curiosity.

When I emailed my landlord about it he mirrored things I'd already thought about, such as pipes, vents, loose fittings, etc. But when I emailed him again saying the noise wasn't going away, he said he'd send someone to investigate. Well, that person never came, and for other reasons, I had to leave that property early. I never did find out what that scratching noise was. Until three years later, in the last year of my degree.

While in a conversation about unpleasant living spaces, I casually mentioned I'd spent some time in a rickety house just off-campus. Hearing me say this, one of them perked up, ""Oh yeah, you don't mean that building near the arts block do you?""

I replied straight away that I did mean that building.

""Oh, well, some kid died there a while ago of an asthma attack. It was very sad.""

This made me very curious so I reached out to my old shoddy landlord and asked him about this. It took him a couple of weeks to reply, but in the end he said this via email:

""Very sad, but there was another student supposed to have moved out a few days before you arrived. He had an asthma attack and died. I didn't feel the need to tell you since it's quite a horrible thing to happen.""

I then remembered the scratching noise and how I couldn't put my finger on what it was. I now knew it all too well. The exact sound... it was fingernails on wood.";16180692560
The humming man;23;4;"I am an angler, but unlike most anglers, I like to fish alone in the dead of night because it helps me forget the fatigue of the day, which is full of human beings.

It was a beautiful night, a warm breeze gently blowing in my face, and I hummed with my fishing equipment down to the empty river, opened the foldout stool, handled the rod and bait, and began to clear my mind.

There was a sudden sound of metal against glass in the distance. Although it was usually a pleasant jingle,at that moment it was certainly a noise to me as I tried to immerse myself in my own world. So I took out my headphones and started playing Taylor Swift's newly released album Fearless(Taylor's Version). I have to admit, despite being a big fan of Taylor Swift, I dozed off while listening to You All Over Me with no one around, no waves in the water, and no fish swimming in sight.

Just as I was about to enter the state of fugue, some abnormal phenomena let my spirit slowly restored. First of all, the temperature around me was dropping rapidly at a rate I could feel, as if it suddenly leaped from spring to winter. Secondly, the sound in the headset became a bit off. It was clearly a clip of Taylor singing alone, but I could clearly hear a duet.

And the harmony in the background continued to increase.

That sent overly painful shiver down my spine, and I suddenly realized something that made me uneasy. To test my idea, I turned off the music. Things went as I expected.

The harmony continued in the background.

Someone near me was humming the song I was listening to. A male's voice.

It's hard to argue that someone humming nearby is dangerous, but if you're out of town at 2am, where no one should be, you might as well ditch your belongings and go into escape mode as I did.

At first I didn't want to alarm Mr.Hell-knows-who, so I chose to creep slowly, but the voice was always following me, whoever was singing had already found me. My adrenaline started pumping and the voice in my head kept telling me: Run. So I started running, trying to get out of my predicament by attaching a rocket engine to my feet. But it put me into desperation that no matter how fast I was running, the sound was always around me, as if the man was attached to my back. I ran until I lost track of time, exhausted and about to collapse. At the same time, a warm breeze came and it seemed that the weather was getting warm again. I woke up just an inch to the ground before I hit the dirt hard. I mean, I really woke up from my fishing dream.

Just another boring nightmare, I thought, ready to open my eyes. Suddenly something made me hesitate about my decision. I figured out a lot of things that confused me in my dream. The sound of metal striking the glass, if you think about it, is very much like the sound of a window being thrown open. The sudden drop in temperature was because the window was opened and the cold wind blew in. The thing that mostly makes me want to scream is the warm air when I'm about to wake up.

It was not a warm breeze, it was the breath of a man no further than an inch in front of my face.

The humming begins again.";16180534310
Becoming change;19;1;"He had a basement, but it wasn’t the cellar.  The cellar was clean and in it he kept virtually nothing.  He made sure no one had a reason to go down there.

I first met Matthew at a park.  I was woken and found myself looking up into the softest brown eyes I’d ever seen.  He was smiling and spoke very gently.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

Sitting up, I looked down at the vomit which was now crusted to my shirt.  I wiped my mouth and pebble-like chunks rolled between my hand and cheek before falling into the dirt.  I began weeping.  In spite of the fact that my clothes could have walked off on their own and the cloying stench of hard living, he put his arm around my shoulders.  I curled into him and let go.

“It’s good,” he assured me over and over again against my unceasing shame.  The voices in my head were the chatter of a thousand squirrels.  Then, he said one thing that changed it all.

“It’s over.” 

Those words did something nothing else in life had:  I was silent inside.  There was no debate.  I realize now what had happened, but at that time I was simply in an awed shock.  And while there were no words in me, there was a revelation of truth: it was over.  There are moments in life when we’re released from one direction, but are allowed the freedom of having none at all.  I knew not where this would take me and didn’t care.

As if he could hear my thoughts, he said, “Come with me.” 

He brought me to his house and gave me a room, washed my clothes and fed me. Over time, we shared deep, intellectual and spiritual conversations.  My perceptions changed and I felt grateful and good for the first time.  Once, I told him, “Thank you.”

“No,” he said.  “Thank you.  You see, by sharing with you, I remember what I’ve learned from my own hard times.  And, you decided to come.  Without that, none of this would be possible.” 

Then, he looked at me and, for the first time, I sensed something off when he spoke. “I need you to help me change, too.”

“Of course,” I said and smiled quizzically.

He took me down to the cellar and, to my surprise, opened a trap door.  I watched him fade into the darkness below.

I don’t remember going down or even if he spoke.  What I can tell you only comes from snapshot images and feelings:  clutching my stomach in disgust, a pounding headache, me strangling him with my bare hands, a puff of breath when I let go.  I remember how coarse my lungs were from screaming and how wet his shirt became from sobbing.

For three days and in spite of the smell and the changes in his decaying form, I remained curled into him.

*It's over, so now it begins*, echoed his voice inside me.";16180555660
Sunflowers Bloom in August;71;9;"I was almost forgetting. Really, I had practically forgotten all about it.

Who am I kidding? I thought about it every day. But at least I could *pretend* that I had forgotten about it.

So I pretended. But when the sunflowers came, I couldn’t pretend anymore.

Freshly-picked bouquet. Arrived on my doorstep this morning, neatly wrapped in pretty pastel paper. No note attached, but I knew who sent it. Might as well have been freshly-picked human organs.

The seed heads are so dark, so empty, so proportionally *wrong*. Could swallow me whole. They remind me of eyes. *His* eyes.

They dig up the memories that I tried so desperately to bury, pull me back to the place where I did it. 

I must go back.

It’s August, so the flowers are in full bloom. Just like when it happened. Watching them reminds me of another thing that I hate about them. Always pointing to the sun as if worshiping their god. Their piety is terrifying. I stand still, sweating in the summer heat, awaiting my judgement.

A slight shift in the breeze, an inaudible whisper on the wind. Something’s wrong. They’re no longer looking at the sun.

They’re looking at me now.

And then I hear the voice I know so well, the voice that haunts my dreams, the voice I’d hoped to get rid of forever. *His* voice.

“I hear the sunflowers are beautiful this time of year.”";16180230090
Riley's Last Snow Day;1386;46;"February 19th, 2004. 

Riley sat in front of the TV like a little kid, eating her cereal and watching the school closures scroll by as the snowflakes drifted down outside the window.

When Riley's school came up closed, Riley said, ""Cool."" She was very cool that year, certainly too cool to make a snowman. But she and her friends did meet up in the park and throw snowballs at each other, sort of ironically. They even tried sliding down a hill on old newspapers, but it didn't work very well. Riley was grinning when she got home, her cheeks pink with cold.

Riley was seventeen years old, and it was her last year of high school. That was the last time that she ever missed school because of snow.


January 15th, 2020. 

Huge drifts of snow floated down outside the window of Riley's apartment. A company-wide email went out: office closed due to snow. 

Riley sat in front of the window drinking her coffee and thinking about all the things she didn't have to do that day. Later she made French toast and folded her laundry. She had a hot chocolate with a shot of brandy at 4PM. Why not? 

Later that year, Riley's employer came to understand that all the employees could work effectively from home. That was the last time that Riley ever missed work because of snow.


December 25th, 2073

A White Christmas. Riley and her great-grandchildren went outside and made snowmen, while Riley's sons and daughters cooked the turkey. Riley's snowman was frowning. She said that he was thinking about the logistics of retiring to Hawaii. Would he melt?

A couple weeks later, Riley fell and broke her hip. That was the last time she ever played outside in the snow.


November 15th, 2151

Snow fell in big white drifts. People looked up and complained. Some were secretly a little pleased. Children played. Vehicles got stuck. Like always.

Riley was dead. But her name was still spoken, there were still people alive who had loved her. And she was a child of that world, so this day was part of her history too.

Video Call;217;14;"I was in a video call with my friend who was in Spain the other day, as it is one of the few ways we can communicate from that distance.

We had so much stuff to discuss, as it had been over two months since we last talked. As I was talking about the security camera system I recently installed, he said he needed to go get a package he was expecting, and so he left. 

Waiting for him to return, I browsed the internet for a bit, but minutes passed and I realized he was taking his sweet time. I opened the video call again to see what was going on, and I was horrified with what I saw.

A lanky figure with bloody claws emerged from his room's window and started crawling in all fours, silently sliding inside his wardrobe with a malevolent smile, exposing its crooked teeth. 

I stared in horror, and then immediately called my friend. 
-""Paul, do NOT return to your room, someone just got in from the window."" 
-""What are you talking about mate? My room has no windows. Just return to the call, why did you leave?""
-""I never-...""

My Hand;79;5;"A week ago I lost my hand in a car accident. An intoxicated driver blew through a red light and t-boned me on my way home. The first responders were surprised to find me alive in my bloody crumpled car but the other driver wasn’t so lucky.

It wasn’t until the day after the crash and I was coming down from the medication high when the situation was explained to me. The other driver had died after the crash when his truck went up in flames. They were unable to find my hand at the scene and suspected that it must have been launched into and lost in the flaming wreck.

The next few days were a blur. They kept me at the hospital to make sure there were no complications post surgery and that I had no additional underlying problems. They explained I would experience some phantom feelings from the lost hand,  apparently my brain would apparently create feeling based on what it would expect to feel. 

At that point my wrist still felt hot and almost as if my lost hand was being held. I attributed it to a numbed burning feeling I have experienced from most injuries.

It was the next day that my concerns spiked.

Laying in bed and still getting used to texting with a single hand when it felt as if the fingers of my missing hand were being moved. 

I held my wrist up and examined the scar. I had been able to remove the bandages the day before but the stitches still looked nasty. 

Examining it close I didn’t find anything off but, to be fair, I didn’t know what I was looking for.

My phantom fingers began to be moved more desperately in what began to feel like a pattern. 

I felt my pinky raise while the rest of my fingers held a fist.

Next all finger tips would rest along the top of my thumb in a loose fist.

Then my index finger and thumb would form an L.

Last my phantom hand felt like it was pointing but with the middle finger just slightly extended. 

After that the pattern would repeat. It just kept going. I wanted to reach out and grab it and end it’s constant movement but there was nothing to grab so I just massaged my forearm and called my doctor. 

He recommended increasing sleep medication and to come to him if the feeling lasted a few days. 

It did. 

After a sleepless night I was able to replicate the motion from the phantom hand with my other hand and it dawned on me. 

I checked the sign language alphabet.

Spilled out my inner thoughts, 

Cut deep... is it appealing?

Heart tugging, sick,

When I cut to the quick. 

 

I pour out my heart,

Wear it on my sleeve. 

Now so heartless and speechless, 

I await no reprieve. 

 

And there’s no salvaging 

This mess that I’ve made,

It’s simply unfortunate: 

I can’t be saved.

Is what will you do?

Have you an answer of love

To this heart meant for you?

 

Accept my heart, bloodied 

And rent as it stands,

Or let it fall, repulsive,

From your unstained hands?

I pray my love will find

Simmer;8;7;"This is what I told Simone years ago: There are many reasons and expections that lay between the desire for a relationship. Either way every requirement is selfish. It's a matter of how much of your selfishness and my selfishness we can handle.

I also told her that night as I put my tongue to good use: Simple minded is when I'm in bed exploring and writing a story within your crevices. Ending a chapter and starting one that's brand new.

Tonight as a red wine sauce simmers away, remember that this knife I hold will set the tone tonight. How ironic that just an hour and a half ago I thought how the sirloin sitting on the kitchen table might just be the best roast I'll ever make. It turned out to be the last one I ever made.

The sauce simmers dangerously quite like relationships do after awhile. A glint or two appeared thrown across by the kitchen lights, which bounced off the cutlery. Yet there's a third glint. That glint resides in my eyes. No one sees this and Simone doesn't expect it either. This is a pity. If she saw the glint that shone bright as my teeth reflected on an insidious grin then she won't be tasting her bile in an hour.

Simone could never stand the sight of blood. But I tasted my blood just 45 minutes later. The beef, I suspect, had grown cold with the gravy congealing quite like the blood pooling under me. I know what Simone thought. I caught a whiff of that sentiment as my thoughts hovered near that roast — Who would have thought that a knife can set things right tonight?";16180521970
Aroma;16;2;"I can taste you from miles away.

I’m not boasting, I’m just saying.

First things first, so we can get off on the right foot as they say. I'm not hunting you as of this moment, but that doesn't mean you're safe from me. 

Not at all my weary little friend.

In fact, once I can sense you, well… 

Truth is, with the way things have been going for a while now, you’ve probably ran into me before.  Well, not me literally, but one of my kind. We get around a lot better nowadays, once we got used to the smell that is. Your aroma is viciously enticing and that made things… difficult, to say the least. 

It is one thing to herd the sheep to the slaughter, as my old friend John used to say, but quite another to learn the benefits of peaceful moderation. 

Yeah, that one took a long time I’m afraid.

Some of the lesser of us even learned a new word, abstinence. Hell, I’m almost certain that you’ve ran into those self hating half breeds. They posses our genes but despise our history, and shun the hunting moon as if they could avoid its call by sheer will. Chaining themselves away from the dance, raising their own cattle for when they do hunt… despicable freaks. Embrace your destiny I always say. The crimson grace of unabashed satiation is the divine will of my creator. Alpha does as Alpha will.

I sit here all alone at this flimsy little table tonight though for a reason. I like to write about my hunts, call it an obsession if you will, but it keeps me calm before my storm. By now though you already know why I’m writing to you, to you in particular. This diner has been on my mind for some time now. It’s a nice enough place, a little cramped for my tastes, but it sits peacefully twenty miles from the nearest town. In about half an hour that will mean something dreadfully final to everyone here, everyone human that is. 

As I said before, I like to write about my turns at the dance, have been for years. I can smell you my friend, and as usual you’re late. I’ll be sure to tell your wife Lauren all about your latest pre-occupation in town before I dance with her. Bet she’s been wondering why you’ve always been late these last few months. I’ve been counting on that though, and if you’ve made it this far, after what you’ve seen tonight, well… you really should have ran away screaming.";16180325130
"""Working"" for a being from beyond the stars.";19;2;"  

You might think working for a formless, god-like being from beyond the observable universe would be hard and terrifying. Well, you’re right, but not for the reasons you think. Honestly, there are examples of humans throughout history that were far more horrible to work for than my Master. When it comes to what is expected from me as master’s servant, there are only 3 rules I must follow. Master is also very forgiving. If I mess up, which only happens rarely, as long as I kneel and give a heartfelt apology, Master forgives me. After all, Master recognizes that I’m just a lowly carbon-based life-form, far from the perfection that is master.

The 3 rules I must follow also aren’t too difficult. Rule one is that Master is allowed to stay in my apartment. It did take getting used to, coming home and seeing a swirling mass of darkness the size of a large dog, speckled with what could be described as light from dead stars trapped within a vantablack orb, floating above my couch and watching tv. Master really likes watching 1990s sitcoms when the reruns are playing, their favorite is Home Improvement.

Rule two is that I must bring Master their food. At first it was hard luring a person every ten days back to my apartment, both mentally and emotionally. But, as with the first rule, you get used to it. Besides, one of Master’s many gifts to me is the ability to produce pheromones that makes me virtually irresistible to anyone that inhales them; another weakness of our primitive bodies and chemical driven minds. 

Rule three is a self-imposed rule, which is immediately clean-up after Master when they’re finished feeding. Master doesn’t care if I clean or not, but the amount of blood and viscera that gets splattered around the apartment per person is amazing. You’d think Master was a wood-chipper or something. So, I clean up immediately after master is done. I don’t want my neighbors or landlord noticing the smell. Don’t get my wrong, I don’t care if master and I are discovered; but they’re nice people and I don’t want Master having a snack before we would be forced to move to a different apartment building.

Some might wonder why I haven’t tried to leave Master’s service. To you I ask this: What do you think I’ve been trying to do every minute, of every hour, of every day, since Master entered into my life? Do you think I like luring people to their death? Do you think I like having to listen to screams of fear and pain every time master eats? I can’t leave or even die without Master’s consent. They may have erased the memory of my existence from every relative and every friend I’ve ever had, but I still remember THEM, and Master’s threats of devouring them are VERY real. So, I continue to work for Master, as I have for the last ten years. Please, someone help me.";16180130400
The real hunter;12;1;The hunter was finishing up the censors around his camp and lookout spot. He had already caught deers and rabbits, but he wanted more. A bear rug would look great on his floor. Maybe a wolf's head on his wall. But it was late, and he was tired. He got a bucket of water and threw it onto the fire. He unzipped the tent and went in. Waking up to his phone buzzing was unwelcome, but he felt better when it was the motion sensors. He got up, grabbed his shotgun, “Tommy-boy” he called it, and burst through the tent door, his excitement soon turned to rage. A dead deer was torn open outside of his tent, and all his game was stolen. He yelled out in rage, slamming his gun into a nearby tree. Red poured out from the tree, he had never seen red sap before. Then, the stump turned, along with the one next to it. A tall, almost human creature towered over him. It had to be at least 25 feet tall. He pulled his gun and shot into the empty eyes and wide open mouth, filled with dead rabbit. Its sharp branch like fingers swiped at the hunter. Its skin was made up of bark and twigs. The hunter dropped the gun and booked it deeper into the woods, for around an hour he ran. He stopped and flopped next to a tree, out of breath. As he rested he felt something strange, branches wrapping around his body. He let out a yelp, before being launched up into the mouth of the creature.;16180213390
Tinkering;158;15;"Father slammed his son's door shut. ""I've had *enough* of that weird kid! Why can't he be like everyone else?""

Mother glared at him. ""He's just *fine* the way he is! He has special gifts!""

Father snorted. ""More like special *needs*. He just sits in his room all day, *building* things! He never wants to go outside, he doesn't have any friends, and he only wants to wear black! This isn't *normal* for a six-year-old!""

Mother tried to soothe him. ""He has all the time in the world to be normal. Let him enjoy his childhood.""

Father threw his hands up. ""Doing *what*? Building towers? Forts? How many sets of Tinkertoys does he have, anyway? Did you see what he built yesterday? A crane! An actual working crane! It has six degrees of freedom, and can be geared lower to pick up heavier loads! And he expected me to be *proud* of him! It's just not *ordinary*!""

Mother responded quietly. ""No, it's not. It's *better* than ordinary. It's *extraordinary*.""

Father paced, frustrated. ""Not to my social media feed, it isn't.""

Mother raised one eyebrow. ""Is *that* what this is about?""

Father pointed his finger aggressively. ""I post images of what he's built, and no one likes them! They're as unnerved as I am! I want pictures of him playing *sports*! Of the trophies he's earned! I want a kid that'll make me *proud*!"" He stared hotly at his son's door. ""I'll make him normal if it kills me.""

Father awoke to an odd sound downstairs. Quietly, he grabbed the baseball bat he kept near the bed, and tiptoed out of the master bedroom. Leaning carefully over the railing, he peered down the stairway. Nothing. He heard it again; some sort of crashing sound. The skylight carried enough of the moon's light to trace out interior details. Father padded quietly to the top of the stairway. The noise again! Eyes fixed on the ground floor, he began walking down the stairs.

His ankle twisted painfully as he fell forward. He caught a glimpse of one of his son's wooden blocks on the stairs; it was nearly the same color as the carpet. Falling awkwardly, he spied his son at the railing, staring straight at him, as he threw another block to the ground floor. Father hit the stairs hard and rolled. His son had been making those sounds with his toys! Father tried to grab for the handrail, but it seemed to come off in gooey chunks. It had been covered with Play-Doh!

Father made up his mind to deal with his awful kid, once and for all, this very night. As he fell forward to the landing at the bottom of the stairs, he saw a beautiful creation in the moonlight. A highly detailed mockup of a frontier fort, complete with smaller buildings, wagons, and a sturdy-looking wall. Glumly, he realized just how detailed it was.

The tightly-packed fence posts, made from finely sharpened Tinkertoys, rushed up to meet him.";16179645170
My housemate was stealing from me;114;16;"
My housemate and I had a brilliant friendship, we hung out together all the time, we ate together, watched movies, went for drives out into the countryside... You know, all the normal stuff. I really thought of us as good friends that could trust each other.

That is until 2 weeks ago when my phone charger went missing. I searched everywhere for it. All over my room, in all the shared rooms, and asked my housemate if he'd seen it anywhere. He said no and suggested I keep searching my room. This time I noticed that the heart pendant I usually kept on my dresser was missing too. This wasn't a coincidence. As soon as my housemate left for work I immediately went to search his room. 
Low and behold, I quickly find my charger just casually laying on the end of their bed. He wasn't even trying to hide it! If he'd taken my charger, then was my necklace in there too? I opened his bedside drawer and there it was... my heart pendant (why did he even take this?? It's worth absolutely nothing!)
 
But that wasn't it... I found a total of 15 items that belonged to me hidden around his room. Stuffed under the mattress, tucked away in the bottom of the wardrobe. Any crevice available, something belonging to me was squirreled away. Stupid, insignificant, worthless items that all related to me somehow. Along with usual possessions, like a book, hair clip, bottle of perfume... There were also way more invasive items like erotic pages from my diary, a framed picture of me, and some of my worn underwear. This guy was a total creep! Was this some kind of infatuation? Had I been overly friendly and given him the wrong impression? He'd never tried to make a move on me, so why was he hoarding all of this deeply personal stuff that belonged to me?
I wasn't going to let this slide. He had been keeping and hiding disgusting mementos of me for god knows how long, and I was going to confront him about it.

As soon as he came home, I immediately asked him what the hell he was playing at. Of course, he denies all knowledge of ever taking anything. He flies off the handle and calls me crazy. He even had the audacity to accuse me of making it all up, or putting the things in there MYSELF! Can you even believe that?! 
I was fuming. 
He was going to pay for this. I was going to show him what a disgusting creep and thief he was by taken something from him every day for 15 days. One little personal memento for every thing he took from me. 

I took something that belonged to him for a nice drive out in the countryside, and hid them where they couldn't be found. 
On the first day  I took his fingers.
On the second day I took his eyes.
On the 3rd day, I took his tongue 
It's actually day 15 now and I only have to find somewhere to hide his torso and I'm done. That dirty little creep won't be able to steal from me ever again. 
Although, now I'm going to need to find a new housemate. I'm thinking of waiting about 6 months until I hide the heart pendant in their room.";16179638000

The Devil's Den;350;14;"I knew something was wrong. A mother always knows. I knew when he told me he felt like a burden. I knew when he started eating less, sleeping more, and stopped spending time with his friends. I tried to talk to him. I really did. But every time, he ignored me or yelled at me to leave him alone.

I miss my little boy. But I know he is in a better place now.

I try not to remember, but I can’t seem to stop thinking about it. He was leaning over the railing, looking down. So far down. Makes me dizzy imagining it again.

I tried not to hear that awful sound. I tried not to look at the mangled mess that used to be my son.

I couldn’t let him hurt himself. Suicide is a sin, you see. I had to protect him. That’s what mothers are for. I protected him in this life, and I protected his entrance into the next. Even if that meant I had to push him.

I couldn’t have him spending all eternity in the devil’s den. Even if that means I have to go in his place.";16179333050
The Cultists Next Door;31;3;"I been living on this farm my whole life. My daddy lived here, and his daddy, and his momma before him. My great granny was a God-fearing woman who worked the land and gave her offering every week as gratitude. Well, hopefully, God’s watching over me cause something ain’t right with my new neighbors. Things have been topsy-turvy ever since they moved in! I went over to introduce myself one evening and the father answered the door in some strange robes, his wife and two children behind him. Now, I don’t know much outside the skills I was given, but I know a family a cultist when I see one! I snuck onto their property to spy on ’em a few times; get a bit a info on what I might be dealing with. It didn’t look like one of those “Cthulhu” cults; no mad ranting, no tentacles, and there ain’t water ‘round here for days. Couldn’t be Satan either cause their farm animals were all accounted for. I thought they might just be some California weirdos and resigned myself back to my own business.

However, as the days went by, I got less and less sleep. My dreams weren’t the same and the milk from the cows didn’t taste right. The last straw was when my fields stopped yielding the bountiful crops that they had for generations! God wasn’t liking this, no sir, and I was gonna put a stop to it. I got my pistol and tore ass toward their property in my truck. I busted down the door during one of their little rituals and took righteous fury out on the parents before they could raise their daggers. The kids were no older than maybe 19, only had to point my weapon at ‘em to get ’em to stand down. I tied ‘em up good with the rope I keep in the truck and brought ‘em back to my farm. 

Now, I know what you’re thinking, and I didn’t need no fancy alter. Our Sightless God don’t require all that pomp and circumstance, just a quick cut along the neck and let ‘em bleed into the soil. Let me tell you that night I had *the* best sleep when I could hear his mad whispers once again. The next day the milk from the cows got back that sour taste people love so much they drink themselves right to death. The earth had claimed those kids for our God and my crops were reaching for the sky once again. I went back to their farm to clean up the parents before anyone else found ’em, and praise to the blind one, their house had been completely consumed by a sinkhole. The sheriff didn’t see no point in digging ‘em out and turned that section a land into a burial plot for the family. Praise to The One who is blind so we might see! I think this year’ll be a good harvest.";16179755860
The friendly witch;20;3;"I heard a large knock on the door .I parted my curtains only to see a very unusual person.

They were of large built yet had a fragile figure. They had pale skin but eyes that showered you with warmth. Everything about them was paradoxical, a person that was simultaneously dangerous yet ever so temptingly friendly. Her figure was only obscured by a translucent purple veil that seemed to ignore the laws of physics. A feint dark glow surrounded her entire body. Staring for too long felt like an insult, as if i were forcing this person to justify their existence to me, yet i continued to stare nonetheless.

The person met my eyes and refused to cast her attention away. She did not look sad, but I felt guilt over letting her stand there and do nothing for so long. I opened up the door, and before she could say anything, I asked.

*Are you a witch?*

Rather unexpectedly, she nodded softly and entered the house. I did not offer the witch permission, but it felt wrong to expect otherwise.

She scoured the room, grabbing numerous objects and investigating them, almost as if finding something and simultaneously being unsure of what she wanted. This went on for nearly half an hour, and I almost became bored with the witch.

*Are you here to eat me*? I asked, with for some reason no desire to protect myself or even escape.

She shook her head and proceeded to recklessly toss my items around. Becoming even more frustrated, I stood in her way and demanded an explanation as to why she was destroying my house. Before she could say anything, I began to hear a faint noise. The noise grew abruptly, and I could make out the sound of crackling fire, and the unsheathing of blades.

""Too late"" she uttered for the first time. Before I could react, she grabbed some rope she found and asked that I tie her. I obliged. She asked that i approach her and I nervously accepted.

Before I could do anything, she lunged her awkwardly tied body at me and pressed her lips against mine. I tried to resist, but before I knew It, i was too enamoured by the witch to push back.

""I am sorry"" she whispered, before a thick cloud of smoke surrounded us both.

A large group of people slammed into my house, many coupled with aggressive dogs and most armed with weapons that seemed to be purposed for witch killing. As they swatted the smoke that surrounded us, I struggled to speak, only to hear the person next to me speak.

""Help me! The witch almost killed me!"" screamed the person, with what I gathered to be my voice. I turned to see a person with my appearance bound by rope, crying whilst expressing fear towards me.

Before I could react, the crowd grabbed me by the shoulders, and before I could do anything, I felt a sharp object pierce my chest.

The crowd chanted ""Yay! We killed the witch!"" As i fell to the ground, only to see a purple veil that surrounded me catch fire.";16179870020
Skipping Stone;25;6;"I’m running as fast as I can, but I don’t think I’ll get away.

I found the rock in the creek down by my house. It was a bit smaller than my hand, and it was worn smooth by years of water and sand on the bottom of the creek. It would have been a perfect skipping stone, but for one thing. It had a hole worn through the center. Cool!

I don’t know what gave me the idea, but after rubbing the stone for a bit, I held it up to my eye and looked through the hole. Whoa. Things looked different through the stone. The trees around the creek had writhing vines hanging from them. The small boulder I often sat on while eating peanut and jelly sandwiches had legs like a crab. They were scrabbling on the ground like the rock was trying to walk. It was failing.

Wherever I looked I saw weird creepy things through the hole in the skipping stone. When I’d look without the stone, everything looked normal. The car in front of my neighbor’s house had arms attached all over the sides. They were reaching out, fingers grasping, trying to grab something I couldn’t see even with the stone. When I got to my house, there were eyes in the walls. Staring eyes, with blood seeping from them and dribbling down the siding in long red streaks.

My mother came out the front door just as I entered the yard. I looked at her through the stone and saw that her face was framed by writhing tentacles. As she reached toward me with her claws, she screamed, “Give me that stone right now!” I started running, but I don’t know where I’m going to, even if I do get away.";16179741460
It's Raining Meatballs (FoodChallenge2021);25;3;"No one knew for sure when the first meatball fell. Some said in early September, others in early August. Everyone knew though, that when the first meatball fell it was a godsend.

It fell like a red-hot meteor, crashing near a village in Africa, sending bits of rock and debris flying in its wake. Soon it had attracted quite a crowd. No one knew at first if it was edible. After all, it just fell out of the sky. But the meat sizzled and smelled heavenly, and drool escaped the mouths of the crowd. Finally a little boy stepped forward and took a bite.

It was the best thing he had ever tasted in his life. Exotic flavours he could not name were blended together in a harmonious symphony, bringing the meat to life. Juice dribbled down his chin. He couldn't help taking another bite, then another.

Soon he was never more full in his life.

After that first meatball many more fell, in Paris, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in many more places, both rural and urban, for the rich and poor. All over the world people came to see this marvel, taking pictures and of course trying the meatball itself, always sizzling hot, for that sweet sweet juice and that sweet sweet flesh.

Then the reports came of people getting sick.

They were rushed to the nearest hospital of course, their faces turning red, and muttering incomprehensibly. But once there, no one could stop them changing.

The eyes were the first to go, bleeding out into the whites and then into itself. Blood dribbled out of where the eye sockets were, as bloody as meatball juice, Then the skin got rougher and shaggier and browning like hard leather, moving and breathing like it was alive, almost. Muscles doubled, tripled, rippling beneath the skin.  Claws emerged, bursting out of hands in long sharp talons, so painful screams echoed up and down the hospital.

Then there was silence for many days.

Dead carcasses of stray cats and dogs were found littered in alleys, with their hearts ripped out.  At the same time, windows were found broken. Shards of glass and shredded machine cables were found lying near the windows.

It took the world mere seconds to figure out what had happened.

Panic erupted. Most people tried to keep their pets indoors, although it was no use, because the monsters seemed to get them anyway. Every night there would be destruction and terror roaming the streets and there was nothing that could be done to stop them.

My team and I tried to round up as many as I could, putting them in a secret government facility desperately built to contain them. But every day they are growing hungrier, and as I watch them tear apart a live gazelle, I realise we have a growing problem.

That we are running out of food and resources to contain them. And the meatballs are still falling. People are still eating.";16179608330
Searching for intelligent life;57;7;"Decades of space travel, and we finally found another planet that harbored extraterrestrial life. 


We landed, reading into the composition of the atmosphere. 1750 ppm for the atmospheric carbon dioxide composition, 16% oxygen, 290.15 degrees Kelvin. It was an atmosphere that would require us to keep our rebreathers on, but wouldn’t kill us just by exposure. 


We stepped onto the surface, noticing at once that this planet was much more humid than our own. Plants and plankton were plentiful, meaning this planet held some form of life. I was beyond excited. As a traveler, our mission was to seek out new life, then decide what would tell them, depending on how intelligent or hostile they were. 


Since life was so rare in the universe, it brought me pride to tell other intelligent beings that they weren’t alone, that they weren’t just a small blip in the scheme of things, that they could be educated about things they’d never have comprehended otherwise. 


So we cloaked ourselves and waited. All part of the mission, observe the lifeforms, and determine if we make contact, then how much information we devolve. 


We observed for a few weeks, but saw no signs of intelligent life. Large insectoid creatures flew around, often attacked by large, reptilian creatures. We called them the Demons; they resemble the demonic creatures from the stories we all heard growing up. Large fish monsters swam through the water at blinding speeds, preying on anything smaller than themselves. 


We sighed. Hopes were high for this planet, the atmosphere could pave the way to intelligent life, but it looked like instead that the monsters had become the dominant species. Unless some random, unexpected chance event occured, this planet would never produce life on the same level as ours. 


We packed up, and left. We sent a signal out, surrounding the entire system, advising anyone traveling and searching for life to avoid this planet. 


DANGER. The signal translated to. HOSTILE CREATURES IN THIS SYSTEM. DO NOT APPROACH THE THIRD PLANET FROM THE SUN. NO INTELLIGENT LIFE EXPECTED. 


Confident we set the beacon up right, the signal would emit indefinitely, far surpassing even the best of our current technology. 


We flew back out into the stars, starting the search for other life forms. I was disappointed that we hadn’t found intelligent life here, but at least we could spare curious travelers the trouble of approaching this planet, even long after the life developing on it ended.


Better safe than sorry, right?  ";16179386170

Robert liked to pick his nose;12;5;"Robert was a disgusting individual and he enjoyed picking his nose and I just find that gross. No one should pick their nose as its just unhygienic and imagine shaking that person's hands. It's put me off my food when I see someone picking their nose. Robert loved picking his nose and he had no shame about it at all, I found him disgusting. It's was the way he picked his nose like he was a professional and I hated him and when he took the bogey out, I felt like puking. Everyone told Robert to stop picking his nose. 

Then one day Robert started picking someone else's nose and this other person was called Eric, but Robert only picks his own nose and so that must mean that Eric is Robert. Robert is just disgusting and Robert tried to tell everyone that he was Eric but none of us believed him as Robert only picks his own nose. It was putrid and we told Robert to stop but he wouldn't listen and when his nose started bleeding, it just added to the whole gruesomeness of it all. Robert kept saying that he was Eric and that Robert was picking his nose but we all knew that Robert only picks his own nose. 

Then Robert started picking another person's nose called Gareth and our minds couldn't comprehend it because Robert only picked his own nose. Then it must have been that Gareth was actually Robert and he seemed to enjoy making people feel disgusting. He did it with such pride and experience the way Robert was picking his nose. Robert kept saying that he was Gareth but none of us believed him and we all thought he was a terrible liar with bad habits. Robert kept in picking his nose to make fun of us. 

Then Robert started picking my nose and I told him to stop but he was so deep into my nose, I had to just endure it. People started thinking I was Robert and I swore to all of them that I wasn't robert but none of them believed me. Then I started thinking I was Robert and then I just didn't think I was Robert but I was Robert, who liked picking his nose for fun and enjoyment.";16179676960
Love;87;13;"It’s 5 pm already. Natasha would be here any minute now. She is always on time. It’s one of her many qualities that I like. I think I like most things about her. My friends don’t feel the same though. They say there is something off about her. I don't believe them. They even make fun of her just because she is a little chubby. ""If you don't give her food, she might even eat you."" They would joke and laugh. I don’t care about them. What if she is fat, I like her, everyone has a different taste. My eyes were set on her the moment I first saw her. And today I was having her for dinner, with my family. I just hope they like her.

I was in the kitchen when the doorbell rang. I could feel my heart pounding and the sweat trickling down on my face. Was I nervous or excited? I don’t know. “You will be fine.” I reassured myself. I opened the door and there she was, 200 pounds of cuteness, standing there like a giant teddy bear. Some people get intimidated by her appearance but I don’t.

“Hey, thanks for agreeing to come early. I am cooking for 5 people and I honestly can’t do it without you."" I greeted her with a kiss on the cheek.

""No problem at all and this way we would be able to spend some time together before your folks arrive."" You could feel the excitement in her voice. ""Come on, it will be fun.""

\-------

Next 3 hours went like a breeze. Cooking was done with a lot of time to spare. It was about time my folks joined. The dinner was ready. Mom, dad with my uncle and aunt would be here soon. It was getting hard for me to wait. I was getting nervous. I could feel the pressure mounting on my chest. What if they don’t like her, all of this effort would be a waste. I was particularly worried about my father’s reaction.

\-------

We were almost done eating and I was still not able to figure out whether my folks liked Natasha or not. I was eager to find out but it seemed like they were teasing me, not letting it on how they felt. I was about to say something to steer conversation towards it when my mother spoke.

“This food is amazing, honey. You are an extraordinary cook.” I was happy that mom liked it.

“So, this was the special dish you invited us all for? What was it? It felt like pork but I am not sure. Whatever it was, I have to say, son, this might just be the best thing I have ever eaten.” Those words from my father made it all worth it.

I am glad that my parents liked Natasha.";16179300600

The Forest;880;31;"Stepping out the door into the fresh spring air, my mother called me over to where she was planting bulbs in the garden.

“Visiting your father again?” she asked, squinting against the morning sun.  She was a beautiful woman in spite of (or perhaps because of) the scars she carried.

“Yes,” I replied.  “But then I’m going for a walk.  I’ll be back soon enough.”

“Jin,” she said, worry creasing her face.

“It’s okay, Mom,” I said smiling until her features softened and she returned to her garden.

I passed through the small town quickly and found myself staring down at my father’s grave.  This year’s new growth was just poking though and I wondered at the cycles in life.  My father had been a tortured soul and he’d wrestled with the demons he’d been given.  I know he’d done his best, but sometimes even life’s best defenses can’t stymie the flow of violence that rushes from one generation to the next.  I reflexively cradled my arm.

Shaking off the reverie, I walked to the edge of the forest.  Most stayed away because of the reputation it had.  It was known as a suicide forest.  Regardless of what people thought of it or defined it, it was sacred.  I felt that reverence with each mossy footstep and through the stillness of the air which carried neither birdsong nor the buzzing of insects.  Just a few hundred meters in, I caught sight of the first shadowy form hanging from the branches.  I stood looking at the dehydrated husk of a man.  Praying for his soul, I moved on.

Soon, like a curtain in some macabre theater, a line of hanging bodies spread out before me.  I hesitated, but pushed through.  I’d heard whispered in town what performances awaited me, but because I’d never witnessed it, felt nervous.

The further I walked into the forest, the fresher the bodies became until, at the heart of the wood, only sacs hung from the branches.  One in particular bulged, pregnant with what it held inside.  I knew this was the one to watch.

It hung from a thick cord and was shaped like a tear drop.  The red veins which ran throughout were vascular and pulsed rhythmically.  The whole pod moved and at times sharp forms pushed against the “belly”.  Then, suddenly, a palm with five fingers dug through.

In a rush of fluids, a fully formed man burst out.  The cord, wrapped tightly around his neck, broke his fall and he clutched at it.  I stared into my father’s bulging eyes as he grappled against the strangling vine.  I watched him until his pupils had rolled all the way back into his purple face and he swung silently.

I sat there contemplating for a while if I’d thought he’d been punished enough.  ‘No’, came a whisper from deep within.  So, I cut down his body to bury him once more in the cemetery so that he may, again, be taken by the forest.";16178694240
12th Street Bodega;15;4;"It was a harsh mid-January Tuesday morning, nothing great about the weather, just the greyish clouds floating right above our heads like a wicked curse over the town. I walked with my hands in my pockets to keep them warm; it was painfully chilly out, almost as if someone had put the AC on full, along with the rigid air.

I spotted an old woman, raggedy and tired-looking, just minding her own business, right outside the bodega nearest to my house. It was where I went to get my daily paper and a few snacks before catching the bus to work. I crossed the road and nodded at her, expecting her to smile or offer me a quick ‘hello,’ as they do, but instead, she just glanced at me with squinted eyes and immediately sat on the floor, crossing her legs, staring at me with a great amount of pain in her eyes. 

I winced at her, only imagining how cold the ground must’ve been. Then I made my way inside the bodega, hearing the same old ring as the door opened. I smiled at the cashier—now a woman in her early twenties instead of the usual old man, James, that worked the store. 

I picked up a chocolate bar and a drink, and then my paper. I put it down on the counter and smiled kindly at the young lady, but she just pursed her lips together and gave me the weirdest most artificial smile ever. I found it incredibly hard to look past, mainly because James wasn’t around. And I kid you not, in the past 6 months of me visiting this very store right before work, James has always been there. I was tempted to ask her where the old man was, but something about her face made me want to just get the hell out of there.

Then I succumbed. “Any idea where James is?” 

“Erm, who’s that?” she asked, almost immediately, like she was waiting for the question. 

“James. The guy who runs this store, he normally works here,” I said, this time clearing my throat because my anxiousness was beginning to show itself.

She shook her head and frowned. “No idea. It’s usually just me.” 

“A-are you sure?” I pressed further, knowing with one-hundred-percent certainty that she was either pulling my leg, or was put on as a replacement for James, maybe because he was sick or something.

“Definitely, man,” she said, “there’s no James. Maybe you’re confusing us with Michael’s down the road?”

I shook my head quickly because I knew what I knew. I paid and left the shop without another word. 

The old woman outside the bodega looked up at me with yearning in her eyes and grabbed my arm aggressively. “Help me, help me, Tom, I don’t know where I am.” Her voice was croaky and hoarse, and I freaked out that she knew my name. 

I pulled away and raced down the road without looking back.";16179447450
Erin, who Claimed she Could make it rain Silver;214;16;"Erin was a slip of a girl, underneath a sea of County-Cork copper curls as sculptable as maple-syrup. Her mind always seemed elsewhere as she sat at the back of class, humming old folk ballads; but she aced her grades with an effortless grace, and had an answer to every question the teachers ever asked.


I only spoke to her twice, as I was quite shy, though I was as taken with Erin as a pig to a truffle. I'd adored her since kindergarten. Erin never had any friends, but didn't seem to need them. She was the sort of eccentric maverick who can't quite click with anyone else except the one she's meant to be with. She'd strangely claim, to anyone who'd listen, that she could make it rain silver from the sky upon someone, but she wouldn't show this magic trick to just anyone, as she could only do it once.


We had practically graduated, and then Erin was off to college, I guess. And then on to many great things, beyond. Our paths might not cross again, I sighed. I'd asked her to the prom, but she'd gone with someone else. This was a blow I'd not expected to be dealt. If only she'd said ""no"", and stayed at home.


I could handle the rejection. Just not the disappointment. Erin, it seems, wasn't anything magical or special. I'd put her on a pedestal, separate from the unholy detritus that calls itself human. I'd always felt that God had sent me a gift. But Erin was no more divine that anyone else.


She swigged whisky, she danced badly, she got kicked out of the school gymnasium. She flipped the bird to the principal. Her prom-date staggered off with her. They propped each other up. Her date made it to the old bridge high above the river, then collapsed in a stupor. And stupid Erin carried on drinking. 


Stupid girl. Walking in circles. Cackling with laughter, at nothing. Nothing but darkness. And a long drop to the shallow water below. ""Erin."" I said. It came out louder than I'd expected. 


She laughed, good-naturedly. ""Hey, no hard feelings!"", she said. ""I'm just not into chicks."" 


It wasn't murder. A crime of passion, perhaps, at worst. Nobody would Blame me. Nobody would know I'd followed them. Nobody ever noticed me at all. I shoved Erin off the bridge, and as she fell, I thought I saw her eyes sparkle. She didn't splash; it was more like a splatter.


Her snoring prom-date grinned as he pissed himself. I checked both ways, then headed home, noticing snow silently swirling above. Strange weather, for May. But this was Minnesota. I felt frightened, but excited. Nobody knew I'd been with Erin on that bridge. They'd probably not blame her inebriated prom-date. But In a small town, his life would still be hell. The stink would stick.


When I got home, three days ago, I realized that it wasn't snow which won't stop falling on me.";16178828440
Totaled;267;8;"The collision didn’t wake me out of my fog. Neither did the vomit covering me, which I’m not sure was there before I crashed or after. My truck was in a ditch, the front end completely totaled. The intense pain in my left shin took me by surprise. Between that, my inebriation and the angle the truck was resting, it was difficult to extract myself. 

&#x200B;

I knew I was completely fucked. I didn’t have any idea where I was. It looked like I would have to find help and think about the consequences after. 

&#x200B;

“Oh my god…” the voice startled me. I turned my head to see a girl standing behind me, head to toe in jogging attire.

&#x200B;

“You need help, oh no. I can… I can get you help.”

&#x200B;

She glanced at my leg and gasped.

&#x200B;

“My parents live about a mile from here. Do you think you can walk?”

&#x200B;

I looked at my shin. It was purple and swollen, a large gash ran up it.

&#x200B;

“I’d need help,” I grimaced. She didn’t hesitate, she helped me to my feet and put my arm around her shoulders.

&#x200B;

“We will take it slow,” she spoke softly. 

&#x200B;

“What’s your name?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Angel,” she replied. Of course it was. 

&#x200B;

The road went steeply uphill and it was harder to put weight on my leg. Angel took a lot of my burden from me, she was unexpectedly strong.

&#x200B;

“What happened?” she finally asked. I felt I couldn’t lie.

&#x200B;

“I… was drinking,” was all I could manage. 

&#x200B;

“I hope you get better,” she said, looking at me thoughtfully. On the horizon, I could see a field coming up.

&#x200B;

“That’s it, right there” she pointed to a farm house in the distance. Finally, we were walking down the dirt driveway. As we made it to the top step I felt the temperature drop. Angel knocked on the door and turned to face me.

&#x200B;

“Good luck,” she whispered.

&#x200B;

Her body collapsed. I had been so used to her carrying my own weight that I fell to the ground trying to catch her. I cried out while looking down at her vacant eyes. The last thing I remember is screaming while her parents came running out in terror. 

&#x200B;

After every horrid moment of that night was over and my injuries were tended to in the early morning hours I was told what police believed happened. I had hit her with my truck, then swerved and destroyed my vehicle. That part I know to be true. They also thought that I had carried that poor girl all the way back to her parents’ home. I know better. Somehow, she stayed to help me, even after I killed her.

&#x200B;

And she still does. I see her every day. In corners when I’m alone, standing behind me when I look in mirrors. She doesn’t mean me any harm. She doesn’t frighten me. She was there to guide me that night, and continues to. She is my Angel.";16178748650
Not a ghost story but a ghost story;24;3;"Around two-thirty on a lazy Monday, u/guzaaarish123 wondered if something was wrong with his email account. A quick review revealed that not a single one of his outgoing messages had been answered in the past nine days. 

Was it possible that assurance of “Your message has been sent” a lie? Or were the responses delivered to some other u/guzaaarish123 or Deleted by an overzealous spam filter!

Then, u/guzaaarish123 sent an email to three friends and a few loyal clients, informing them that he was experiencing some technical difficulties and asking for confirmation that they had received this message.

No one responded to his email.

Further, u/guzaaarish123 replied to several spam messages as well, weirdly personalized pleas promising money and sexual powers which too did not break the silence.

Next, u/guzaaarish123 tried WhatsApp. Within forty minutes he produced a draft. forwarded messages and a pale gray “Sent at 5:52 PM on Monday” appeared beneath his lines, the messages went unanswered.

Finally, He tried calling his friends even clients but reached their voicemails instead. Straight to voicemail. He tried calling his parents. Voicemail.

To rule out the possibility of a global communication crisis, he turned on the news. The anchors spoke of soring temperatures but said nothing about crashed servers. The problem was his alone.

The only option left was to meet someone in person. Did people still do that? Show up at a friend’s house unannounced….like a sitcom neighbor? Probably not, but what choice did he have?

Weak fluorescent bulbs lit the hallway in Graham’s apartment building. u/guzaaarish123 rung doorbell, it croaked like it hadn’t been pressed in years. Nothing happened. He remembered Graham smiling and telling him, “I’m always home, man.” But he wasn’t home right now.

His friends Seth and Sarah lived in a squat, salmon-colored house. Their cars stood in the driveway. Their doorbell rang, full-bodied and loud. No answer. He stretched on his tiptoes to peer in through the kitchen window, it was dark inside but television lights flickered in the living room.

Not knowing what to do, u/guzaaarish123 went to a bar. The sticky hardwood floors smelled of spilled beer. Flatscreens lined the walls and lit the room up There were no more than a dozen people in the place, yet he was unable to get the bartender’s attention. 

He tried calling out, “Excuse me?” And then, even louder, “Excuse me! Over here!”

He felt himself receding, falling into his own chest.

He walked out of the bar and stood on the busy sidewalk. At first, a stranger’s elbow and a floppy handbag punched him on the left shoulder and the right hip, respectively. He liked the sensations and wanted more; 

if enough people crashed into him, maybe they could push the loneliness out. Quickly, though, the flow of pedestrians learned his shape and split in two around him. 

No one touched him, no one looked at him, and no one spoke to him, precisely because they knew he was there.";16179117830
Tumour-Eyed Tulip;1193;60;"When I first met Tumour-Eyed Tulip, I had just one question for her. *Do you have a tumour under that eyepatch?* I know it may sound blunt and all, but that’s kids for you.

Strange thing is right, we all had a Tumour-Eyed Girl growing up. It’s like those shared urban myths, like how Marilyn Manson removed one of his ribs to stab someone with or whatever, except this thing was *real*. Case in point, my cousin Jacob, who went to West Fletcher High, had a Tumour-Eyed Trudy, and my friend Dan from the Flats had a Tiffany.

Dan’s cousin Tilly said he had a Boil-Nosed Brenda, but he was always full of shit, so fuck him.

Anyway, my Tumour-Eyed Girl, Tulip, was the most beautiful creature ever to grace this earth, and I was desperate for her attention. So I asked how big the tumour was, and if it was all black and slimy, and if it grew from within the socket and out or the other way around.

“It’s not, um, a tumour,” she whispered. “It’s almost a cyst.”

“What’s the difference?” I asked.

“One is a tumour, the other isn’t.”

“Aaaahhh.”

She blushed and hid her eyepatch under her fiery red hair. Being a gentleman, I playfully kicked her in the knee - you know, to make her forget the awkwardness - and she kicked me back, thus making us boyfriend and girlfriend per the ancient rules of the Schoolyard Kingdom.  

She never really let me in though. By that I mean, she never let me look under her eyepatch, the mystery of which equated to about one third of my romantic interest in her.

“I bet it isn’t even that bad!” I said all boyfriend-like. “Not super-gross at all!”

“It’s not that,” she muttered. “It’s just that my sister doesn’t like you.”

“What does that have to do with your tumo-”

“It just does!” she yelled, and ran off crying. Per the primeval agreements of the Schoolyard Domain we were now divorced.

I moped around for several hours after the breakup, but then my friend Colin tripped and fell down some stairs, so everything was right with the world again. But after school I felt this knot in my stomach, and I figured I owed Tulip a fake apology.

“I’m sorry your sister doesn’t like me,” I said to her. 

“It’s not fair,” Tulip murmured. “She hasn’t even met you properly.”

“Well, let’s do it now then!” I exclaimed excitedly.

“Um, OK...I guess,” she shrugged, pulling down her eyepatch slowly.

“Uh, wha-”

To this day I can’t think back to that moment without stabbing myself repeatedly to alleviate the mental agony. The tumour, which wasn’t a tumour, but almost like a cyst - a sister - was warty and disfigured, like a hairy ball of moist brown clay spread across a pus-filled organ. A horizontal fleshly slit flapped open like loose skin, and gargled out a single hideous word.

Addiction;241;7;"Cold turkey.

I think that's the term used to describe suddenly quitting something addicting.

If so, that's exactly what I felt like while trying to quit. Like a turkey in a freezer.

I had started small with my abuse, with just one or two of them. But I soon spiralled into seven or eight a night, just to satisfy myself.

I couldn't live like this, so I decided to quit.

I tried. 

The first few times it didn't work. I was back to my old habits in no time. I tried subsitutes. I tried drugs to counteract its effects. But it worked better this time. I stopped myself for a full thirty days before the shaking started.

My hands shook so much, I couldn't go about my day to day life without dropping one thing or another.

My mouth started to go dry as well after day forty. No matter how much water I drank, I was never satisfied.

I was afraid. 

I couldn't go back to that dark place I had dug for myself.

I wouldn't.

Then came the hunger after the fiftieth day.

Oh how my stomach rumbled. The emptiness was like no other. Much like the thirst, no amount of food could satiateem me. I was always hungry.

My skin started to itch after two months. It felt like a million little bugs moving underneath my skin, poking my flesh with their tiny feet. 

After the seventieth day, I caved in. I'm sorry. I really couldn't help myself. The pain was too great to deal with.

Under the cover of darkness, I shambled out of my house and onto the street. Yes, my condition was that bad. I found someone in an alley who looked as if he had what i needed. 

I cornered him and begged him to give me some. He looked horrified. He said no and told me to get away from him. He shoved past me and made his way down the alley.

I was weakened by my abstinence, by that did not mean I had lost all of my strength. 

I pulled him back into the alley and sunk my fangs into his neck.

Oh how it felt to taste blood after all this while.";16178565480
Bottle In Front Of Me;40;4;"""What'll it be?"" The short fat bartender asked me. 

**My pencil scrolled across the page, checking each box that fit the symptoms.**

""Something strong. A whiskey on the rocks is my go to. I haven't been feeling right."" My answer of a simple drink pleased him enough to smile and make it quickly.

**A random nurse sat me down in wheelchair. She straightened her papers from behind a small desk then grinned politely.**

Before the man handed me the drink, he warned to not make him regret it with any foolishness. 

**Her fancy explanation for my symptoms was completely lost on me. But I knew the gist of her speech meant she was going to help me today. A new simple procedure.**

After exchanging a few pleasantries with him, he served a newly invented mixed drink.

**Not long after the conversation with the nurse, I found myself sitting in a dental-like chair. A faint buzz of fluorescent lights filled the room. The doctor walked in with a bunch of chrome tools.**

""What did you name this drink? It's pretty damn good."" My voice sounded slightly drunk.

**He explained in simple terms. ""Today we will be preforming a new procedure called a frontal lobotomy. It should help.""**

After about 6 mixed drinks, a horrible migraine hit my brain like a truck. 

**All I could think about was how large the needle inches from my eye was. I fearfully tried to close them but the stab never came. Instead, the smell of beer hit me. The hospital somehow disappeared and I found myself inside a familiar bar. The bartender motioned for me to come to him.**";16178936120
My sister is dating a magician.;181;8;"I havent seen my family since the accident last summer. I've been held up in the hospital with a busted up spine from getting t-boned by a drunk driver. I made it in time for my mothers birthday, fully healed and ready to go. Everyone was questioning how I recovered so quickly, and hell, even I question it sometimes. I just shrugged them off and said, ""I had one hell of a surgeon"". 

As the evening wound down, and the family retired to the living room, my sisters boyfriend took me aside to have a chat. I tried to think about the last time I had a one on one, man to man talk with this guy, but I couldnt recall. I know the last time I spoke with him was when I was in the hospital. But I was pretty drugged up when I was in there, so I dont really remember what I told anyone. 

""So, how is your back big guy?"" he said with a smirk.

I rubbed my back and nodded my head, ""Yeah its doing great. No more pain meds, still a little physio, but i havent seen any loss of movement.""

""So it all worked out for you then?"" He smirked. 

""uh, yeah. The doctors did a great job"" i replied. 

I could see his brow furrow and a large smile come accross his face. ""So now that you have your movement back, I'll take what's owed to me"". 

I laughed at him, ""The hell are you talking about?""

He rubbed his chin in bewilderment, ""You dont remember what I offered you in the hospital.""

As I tried to scoff at his question, the memories flooded back into my mind like an explosion. I was in horrible, tremendous pain, more pain than I have ever felt in my entire life. I was begging for more pain meds, but they couldnt give me anymore. I was told my family was here to see me, but the only one who came into the room was my sisters boyfriend. He laughed when he saw me suffering. He laughed when he heard my pleas for help. but he asked me a simple question, and I gave him an honest answer. 

""What would you give me if I could make this all go away?"" He laughed.

""Anything"" I cried. 

""Excellent"", and when he muttered those words, my vision blurred, and everything started slowly getting better. Every day, every hour, every minute. I felt amazing. 

I looked into the living room to call for my sister, ""Hey Abby, what the hell is wrong with your-"", I stopped dead in my tracks as my family was gone. Their shirts, pants, shoes, and socks were all there, but they, themselves, were gone. 

""You said I could take anything, so I figured I would take it all"".";16178590880
Fin;15;4;"The steel and concrete melted as swiftly as an ice cream would on a hot summer day and I realized that the heat and intensity of the nuclear explosion was beyond the capacity of my body’s insignificant molecules to handle. After all I was just another human being in a world of 7.5 billion people and even if I died right here and right now the loss of my energy and being would be miniscule. It would be negligible.

The blast had sent a force field destroying anything that foolishly stood in its path. The heat wave was coming next; barreling towards anything that was left in its radius and burning it down to its last atom.

I turned and ran as if that was enough to save myself. I still had to; I was merely collateral damage in a game the players would still be playing long after my demise. Who would remember me? I could barely look after myself.

I laughed, thinking my last thoughts are not even worthy of myself, as I ducked into a building. The impossibility of the situation astounded me. It was as if my body was on auto mode but my mind was still in shock. My legs carried me to the basement parking where many people were already gathering. As soon as I approached the edge of the stairs a blast sent me hurtling forward and concrete fell on the place I was standing on just seconds ago.

The staircase was blocked.

The light disappeared.

The building collapsed or it did not exist anymore, I couldn’t tell as I covered my ears from the defeaning noise and ran towards the end of the parking lot which led to another basement parking; a level below. I ran down the road and tripped over concrete. The roof was collapsing. It would never hold under the weight of whatever was on top now – or rather wasn’t.

I didn’t stop to think as I got back up and ran towards the edge of the basement. When I came to a dead end I stopped and decided to finally give up. The air was getting denser by the second. I sat down and watched everyone run frantically, screaming, looking for a way out. I wasn't going to tell them that this our final resting place.";16179021900
Water is life;55;8;"Micah knew something was wrong with the community water well that sat in the center of town.The water had always been sweet and crystal clear; but today it was different.

""What's the hold up there?!"" someone at the back of the line complained.

""Sorry!"" Micah apologized, ""But does anyone else notice anything funny about the well water?"".

No one in the long queue answered, all were too busy trying to get their two large wooden pails of water.

""Are you done or what?"" A snobby woman asked as she shouldered her way by.

""Sorry!  Sorry, but please look at the water!"" Micah implored the woman as she went about fetching her own buckets of water.

""Oh who gives a shit?!  Now move before you get thrown in like the others!"" the woman snarled at him.

""It's Sunday!  You can't nor shan't utter such curses on this day!"" Micah tried to chastise the grown woman in his utter shock, his voice cracking.

""Who's going to stop me?  A right little shit like you?  Now move!""

The woman shoved by and nearly did succeed in pushing him down into the well, had Micah not caught his balance.  The next villager stepped up to take their turn.

""Please, look,"" Micah said, his voice desperate and pleading.

The woman sighed loudly and looked.  She didn't seem to see the eyeballs, teeth, intestines, and brackish-red water.  How could she not see that?  Annoyed, the woman turned back to her work at hand.  All the villagers looked the same, angry, annoyed, untrustworthy, and dangerous now.

""I need to see the Father, he'll help me and believe me!"" Micah cried out as he turned to run.

A line of villagers blocked his path and without a word, beat him unconscious with their wooden pails.  Bloody and twitching, they lifted the boy up and carried him to the well.  As one, they tossed the boy in, grinning widely when they heard the tell-tale splash at the bottom, followed by the sound of crunching bones and muffled wailing.";16178756650
Me And Ed;54;5;"Me and Ed were always the closest of friends, we both turned to each other when in need, we have an unbreakable bond. 

Ed told me about the old house on top of the hill where the puppet man lives, Katie had told him how the house freaked her out, she swears that she see one of the puppets in the window blink as she looked in. Of course Katie was known for being a drama queen so I took that with a pinch of salt, but Ed wanted to go check it out, and I having nothing better to do decided to accompany my best friend.

We approached the house, it was very run down, the roof had holes in it, and the windows had cracks all down them, and the sight of puppets of all kinds greeted us from the windows, Ed leaned into one of the windows for a better view, but just as soon as Ed was peering in the front door opened, an old frail looking man who looked to be in his eighties greeted us, ""Hello boys, can I help you?,"" the old man said with a voice that sounded tainted by decades of smoking.

""We was just looking at your puppets, sorry if we bothered you,"" Ed said as he scratched his ear, something he did a lot when he was nervous.

""No need to apologize dear boy, you can both come inside for a better look if you like?,"" the old man said with a caring tone.

""We are not really supposed to talk to strangers,"" Ed replied.

""That is very smart, my name is Bill Hyde maker of puppets,"" the old man said with a smile.

Ed looked over to me, and then back over to Bill, ""I guess a quick look would not hurt,"" I followed behind Ed as we went inside with Bill Hyde.

The house smelled of burned wood, and a smell I could not put my finger on, the furniture was about as worn out as the house itself, and the wallpaper looked as if it was from the 1940s, but the thing that caught mine and Ed's attention was the thousands of puppets all around the house, their eyes seemed to meet ours with an almost human look to them, a look of sadness even.

""My whole life has been dedicated to making puppets, they are my family,"" Bill said with pride.

""They are really cool,"" Ed said as he leaned in for a closer look at one of the puppets.

""Do you boys want to see something even cooler?,"" Bill said with excitement.

""You bet we do,"" Ed said with a tone of curiosity.

""Ok then, follow me,"" Bill began to head up the stairs.

As we were going up the stairs that strange smell returned to my nostrils, what it was tho I do not know.

""Through here boys,"" Bill gestured towards a room to the right of the stairs.

Upon entering the room we noticed a huge box with a door in the middle of the room, made out of some kind of metal.

""What is it?,"" Ed asked.

""Why this is where the puppets are made dear boy,"" Bill said with a clear passion in his voice.

""How?,"" Ed said baffled.

""Go inside and see for yourself,"" Bill said gesturing towards the metal door.

Ed was a little wary at first, but proceeded to enter the box, and I followed him inside, the door slammed shut behind us!.

Now here we are sitting on a shelf with nothing more than our thoughts, just Me and Ed.";16178719000
It flows.;20;2;"It starts as a dream. 
 A dream where the world runs like oil in the rain, dripping and sliding and smearing.

I can taste it. 
 Melting into my tongue and down my skin with each thump-thump-thump of my heart. It tastes like old moss teeming with the skitter-crawl of mites and those things that wriggle and writhe.

I can feel it.
 Sliding on my shoulders and neck like the touch of a melting lover, the warm-cold wet embrace of those tongues made from bristle-thistle sharp longing.

I breathe it in, feel that ache deep in my chest as I smear into the next pool of iridescent decadence. 
My mind spills into my heart, into my throat, into the scream I make as I wake.

I gasp. 
Yank heaving breath after heaving breath into my lungs as I struggle for clarity. Time is a smear, a fog as the rain splatters against my window. 
A hand flicks on the lamp at my bedside, and the smell hits me first.

It smells old. Like dust. Like ink spreading on the page from ages past, pulling that kaleidoscopic vista from history into the present. It spreads.
The rain becomes whispers, hushed sounds that blend from one to the other to the other to the other and I can’t stop it.

I scream.
 A hand; afoot; a claw; a mouth; a wing touches my ankle, grabs me tightly, pulls me towards that smear on the world, turns my mind to mush as they, as it, as she, as he, as we yank and tug and smear my body against my bed. The oil runs thick and heavy, my screams blend into the whispers that blend into the shouts.

I cry.
 Time shudders and drip-drip-drips onto my floor, my mouth dissolves into that delightful smear, my hands become prismatic slicks of nothing. I flow. I flow. I flow. A twist, some vague pattern to the nonsense, shimmies into view. One eye goes, bleeding into everything that is all at once together.

I moan.
 That one last burble, that one last sound of hope, that last moment of me being me being you being we…


The dream ends. The dream… ends.
 And my eyes open as the world runs like oil in the rain, dripping, sliding, and smearing. 
And it begins again.";16178909540
Mood Booster;32;2;"My name is Otis Ridlen, and I am one of a handful of people who trialed a pill to boost moods. Revolutionary! State of the art! Cutting edge! Sound familiar? I ate it up, literally. But let’s back up, let me tell you how I became whatever I am at this point.

To call me a slob would not be cruel enough. In my thirties with zero ability to carry a conversation and a hairline receding faster than it took me to crawl out of my sweat-infused bed, I was at a new low. Who knew you could sink so far? Things were so grim that one night, I slipped a pizza delivery guy an extra twenty to hang around his car until an escort arrived. No, I wasn’t going to dare show myself to her. I simply looked through the blinds while she carried my pizza and dropped it off on the front porch, collecting an envelope of cash in the process. I stared and then closed the blinds when her eyes caught my gaze.

But by some miracle strike of slob lightning, my phone rang. I don’t know how they got my information, but they found me, and I was hooked. It was an opportunity to get better, to build confidence.

The pills arrived, and I gulped down three at once, despite the warning that one per day should do the trick. Within an hour, I already felt alive, like a new me was being born. I looked at my bright, chubby cheeks in the mirror and grinned wider than I thought was possible. 

I took my first selfie and created an online dating profile, my hands shaking in delight, as I clicked the upload button. Messages flowed in. I was off to my first dinner date with another human. Conversation went well, but she told me she was not interested in a second date. She wished me luck. I replied by telling her I was in the same boat as her, no interest in a second date, and then I must have kept my smile on for too long, because she stormed out of there in disgust, as my shit-eating grin stretched from ear to ear.

My heart, one big glob of confidence, started pumping out extreme decisions and reactions. Doesn’t help that I was addicted to the pills. One evening, my manager told me to add more salt to the fries, so I dumped an entire container, as he promptly fired me while my face beamed with glee.

Unfortunately, I have reached a new low. I’m eating a ridiculous amount of food. One order of pizza changes last minute to five pies. Last night, my body twitched violently while I went to town on a bag of chips. The smeared crumbs on my finger made me lick my lips and crunch down on a few of my fingers. I need help. I’m afraid my fingers won’t be enough.";16178779330
Giggles The Clown;26;13;"Small Sam bounded from the passenger seat, the door slamming behind him. He bounced up and down excitedly, scanning the park for his friend. Unable to wait any longer, he sprinted away. ""Sam! Stay where I can see you!"" Sam wasn't worried. It was a nice park.

He made it to the fountain. It gushed in its happy, perky way, randomly sending up jets of water. Still no sign of his friend. A faint honking sound wafted through the air. Sam's head snapped towards it, and he dashed away. ""Sam! Wait for me!"" His mother still lagged far behind.

Cresting a hill, he finally saw his friend. Sam burst with joy. ""Giggles!"" The clown turned his way, a beaming smile breaking out on his painted face. ""Small Sam! So great to see you again!"" Sam hopped the rest of the way there, and hugged Giggles, who patted him affectionately on the head. Sam caught a glimpse of three tough-looking guys, sitting on a bench nearby. He hadn't seem them here before.

Giggles held up several foam balls. ""Do you feel like juggling?"" Sam squealed happily. ""Yes!"" Before long, the balls were sailing through the air. Sam loved to watch them float. He saw his mom in the distance, walking slowly towards him, out of breath.

Suddenly, Giggles was shoved to the ground. The three tough guys towered over him. ""We're sick of your noise, pal!"" Giggles rolled over backwards and sprung to his feet, throwing his arms up in a ta-da motion. ""But we're just having *fun*!""

They pulled knives. ""I said, *shut the heck up*!"" Giggles protested, eyes wide with fear. ""Wait, fellas! Can't we talk about this?"" He caught the full length of a blade in the side, falling down screaming. Sam's mother wailed. ""Sam! NOOOO!!""

Police whistles blew in the distance. Rudy, Anthony, and Vito bolted in separate directions. Sam just stood there, mouth gaping, not moving.

Rudy hid in some bushes, fighting to catch his breath. A police officer tackled him and handcuffed him in one swift motion. Rudy wondered how he'd been spotted, then uneasily noticed the garishly-colored coat he was wearing, just like the one Giggles wore.

Anthony put great distance behind him, but suddenly tripped and fell. What had happened? He felt himself pinned and handcuffed, then yanked to his feet. As he was dragged away, he noticed he was wearing gigantic floppy shoes, just like Giggles wore.

Vito found himself trapped at the lakeshore. He whirled around to see a policeman approach. He pulled out his gun and fired; the cop did too. Vito felt the hot sting of lead and fell to the ground; at least he took his shot. He was aghast to notice a stick protruding from the barrel of his gun, dangling a flag that read ""Bang!""

Sam watched all this from a distance, glaring angrily, as the three toughs were led away by the police. Inaudible to all of them, he managed to growl a response: ""I...like...*clowns*!!!""";16178763960
The Gravel Serving Man;7;1;"Grape jelly poured on a wasps’ nest. Blue cheese wrapped in honey. An elephant’s foot stepping on the shores of a candy island. All these juxtaposing flavours kept exploding in my mouth without end. The gravel-serving man smiled in response to my shocked expression, shaking more pellets of stone in his hands. I asked him,
 
“This is incredible! How did you make it taste like this?”

He flashed a crooked grin at me with mottled teeth, cracking his jaw open to answer,

“Starvation is usually the best seasoning, my friend.”

I slapped my withered palm onto my forehead as I chuckled to myself,

“Of course! How could I possibly forget!”
 
We both then laughed until the last body of our town dropped dead. I guess kings care not for our hunger strikes. *Hilarious.*";16179009600
Eating Me Up Inside;13;0;"There’s something that’s really been eating me up inside. I feel weighed down and I’m not sure how to fix it. I’ve talked to doctors who told me it was all in my head and gave me meds. Then a therapist told me it’s the weight of my insecurities and feelings of loss. And for a while I felt a little better, less drained.

I took time to identify the trigger to this sinking feeling in my gut. I think what started it was the woman I met online. She was beautiful with large dark eyes and an even wider smile. Kind of lanky but she obviously took great care of herself. We chatted for a bit then went on a wonderful date at an outside bar. She wasn’t great with english but I didn’t mind, although I couldn’t really place the accent.

She was more than happy about our compatibility and we spent the night talking about my hobbies, growing up, and an embarrassing time in my life when I bought into all that Area 51 nonsense. She laughed nervously but I assured her it was just a college phase. I asked her where she was from and she said she had traveled for work but it had taken her longer than expected to finish her assignment. Lucky for me. God, I love an ambitious woman.

Things got a little heated as she groped and pawed at me. I held her close as she squeezed my waist; pressed her hand firmly on my stomach; and felt along the sides of my chest as we kissed. I know it sounds silly but I saw a future with her and I think she saw one with me too. Not enough people ask about genetic diseases in families early on in the dating phase in my opinion. After all you might have kids one day; I appreciated her boldness and vulnerability in asking.

I asked if she’d like to come back to my place for a night cap since our date was going so well and she emphatically agreed. Let me tell you she definitely knew what she was doing and did it with gusto. My head is still a little fuzzy from the drinks but I remember looking up at her in a blissful daze the entire time. Unfortunately, she disappeared by the time I woke up the next morning. I couldn’t contact her after that; her phone was disconnected and profile totally gone. That feeling in the pit of my stomach started shortly after. It’s been 7 months since then, she surely must be back home by now, wherever that is. Never got a chance to ask.

This heavy feeling in my stomach though. It can’t all just be anxiety. I’m gonna lie down and rest after I post this. It feels like my meds are reacting with something I ate. Like my stomach is trying to bite and claw its way out of my body.";16178882810
Stalker;130;6;"Gym was unusually quiet today. Only 2 people other than me. David is regular, he smiled and waved towards me. I didn't know the other guy, although his face seemed familiar. I felt like I had seen him somewhere but I couldn't place him. I shook off the feeling and got on with my routine. 

A quick warmup and I moved to the treadmill. I caught a glimpse of him in the mirror, he was looking at me. It's not unusual, I am used to it now. Guys stare at me, a lot, and not just in the gym, it's everywhere I go. Initially, it feels flattering but then it becomes annoying. With time you learn to ignore it. I usually don't feel threatened but when there are less people around, it feels a bit unsafe. 

I kept running, and increased the speed a little. When I slowed down a bit to catch my breath, I felt an impulse and looked towards him. He was still watching me. ""What a creep."" I muttered and continued. But then every time I looked in his direction, I caught him staring. It was like he wasn't working out. Just sitting there, watching me. It was getting uncomfortable. 

It was then it hit me, I had seen him earlier today, on the bus, on the way to the office. And not just today, I got the feeling that I had seen him before too. On the bus. Near my therapist's office. In the grocery store. Was he stalking me? I looked around, David wasn't there. He must have gone to the washroom. Only one trainer today, and even he was busy on his phone. I was in a safe place but the feeling of danger still loomed over. 

I was feeling uneasy but decided to continue my workout. I had come after a long break, I needed to get back to my routine. I decided to do bench press. I loaded the weights, lied down on the bench, got under the bar and placed a firm grip with my hands. That was when I noticed that he wasn't sitting at his position anymore. I felt relieved and was about to lift the bar when I saw 2 more hands under the bar. I freaked out but then I looked up. It was David, giving me support. 

I got up and looked around. There was only 2 of us in the gym. I felt relieved.

""Hey Laila! It's good to see you back."" David said. ""I hope you are doing well now. Hey, listen! Don't think about it anymore, please. It wasn't your fault. His windpipe was crushed the moment the bar fell directly on his throat. He had added too much weight and you are not strong enough to hold that. He shouldn't have asked you to spot him. You couldn't do anything there. Don't blame yourself.""

And then I realised why he was following me.";16178434480
I have always got to make sure that I am taller than my girlfriend;14;14;"I have always got to make sure that I am taller than my girlfriend and it's a miserable kind of existence. I am 6 foot 1 inches tall and my gf is about 5 foot 7 but I am constantly making sure that I am taller than her. I guess she picked me more for my height and this is my first relationship I have ever been in. I remember when she went up some stairs first and when she got quite high she looked down at me and scoffed. 

""Your smaller than me you said you were tall. You liar you scum bag!"" She shouted at me 

""No you are just at a higher place because of the stairs"" I replied to her and when I caught up with her at the same level, she realised that I was taller than her. It was strange but this being my first relationship I kind of let it go.  I remember once when we were hiking someplace that was very up hill, she had gone further than me and when she looked back at me she scoffed at me again ""you liar! you said you were taller than me you scumbag!"" she shouted at me and got a knife out. 

I was terrified and I shouted out loud ""I am taller than you it's just that you are at a higher place on this mountain"" and when I caught up to her at the same level, she realised that I was taller than her. She calmed down and told me off at the same time and said ""you have always got to make sure that I am not taller than you. It doesn't matter if we're going up the stairs or hiking up some mountain"" 

I started to have seconds thoughts about this relationship and there was something definitely wrong with her. She had hiked up this mountain before with her other boyfriend's and she confessed to me that she had killed her other boyfriend's because she thought they were smaller than her whenever she got to a much higher place. She hid some bodies on this mountain and she showed them to me as an example for me, so that I can always make sure that I am taller than her at all occasions. I have got to get out of this relationship.";16178810800

Mommy’s Garden;18;4;"

Ever since i was a little girl, my mother’s garden was always off limits. When i was younger and more naive, i assumed it was because she had prize-winning plants she didn’t want disturbed by several young preteens. In my teen years, my siblings and I all went through a crime podcast phase, which made us suspect something more sinister.  Sneaking into the garden was a regular activity for us, like a video game that’s impossible to beat but still fun to play.

“She’s *definitely* hiding dead bodies” My older brother Eli would often hypothesize.

“No, i feel like maybe she’s laundering money or part of a drug scheme or something” theorized my younger sister Hope.

“Guys, you’re both wrong.” I started off on our way home from school, “That’s where she hides the matches to all of our socks”

We giggled heartily, giving us a substantial boost in serotonin. 

Before we knew it, it was 6:00 and our mom still wasn’t home from work. 

“You guys wanna try to dig up the garden tonight? Mom’s not answering my texts.” Hope said, biting into an apple. 

“Sure” we both answered in unison.

All three of us got up from the dinner table and headed out into the patio, very cautiously. 

“Nothing so far” Hope continued, munching on her apple.

As we navigated our way into the garden an eerie feeling swept over us. Mom was nowhere in sight. 

We passed a blue hose that laid out across and flowerbed and immediately high fived each other.

“This is the farthest we’ve made it!” Eli shout whispered before running to a flower bed to start digging. 

Enthusiastically, we dug. Adrenaline pumped through our veins as we dug. Hope, still munching innocently on her apple.

“Fuck!” Hope yelled, quickly covering her mouth with her hand as if that would somehow take back the extremely loud shout she had made. Her tooth fell from her gums. 

We  looked in disgust and fear at her. Not from the tooth itself, but at the dark black liquid, like oil almost, pouring from the gaping hole in her mouth where her tooth was. But we had something more to worry about.

We all looked in the holes we had been digging. As almost expected, we saw three rotting, almost indistinguishable dead bodies. 


We weren’t expecting them to be ours. 

Terrified we ran into the street, hyperventilating with fear. 

We were all shouting and yelling at each other so loud, we didn’t notice our mother standing behind us. 

She was holding several gallons of blood in milk jugs in her hands. 

“I didn’t want to have to do this kiddos.” She pressed a button on a remote and we all fell to pieces. She pumped each individual body part with blood as she giggled, 
“You guys find out this secret at least once a year. Pigs blood shipment came late today, which was unfortunate.”  
She pulled out another remote and pressed a button, and my mind went blank.";16178764600
To be or not to be;46;5;"She sits at the edge of my bed every night. I can’t see her, I can’t hear her, but I can *feel* her. I’m not scared of her. But maybe a bit wary. 

“Who are you?” I ask.

“You know.” (I don’t.)

“Why are you here?”

“You know that too,” she replies.

“No, I really don’t. Are you here to kill me?”

“Why are you so afraid of death?”

“I’m not.” I retort. (Am I?)

“Yes, you are. You’re afraid because you think there is some inherent worth in being.”

“Being what?”

“Being alive, being conscious, just *being*.”

“Isn’t there?” (There must be.)

“Of course not.” (As if she is chastising a misbehaving child.) “For now you’re just a meaningless combination of subatomic particles that wants to believe it is something more. But someday, it will be as if you had never been. It won’t matter what you are now.”

“But shouldn’t it matter to me? What about the gift of life?”

“Gift? Life is only pain made bearable by shots of dopamine at irregular intervals. It is better not to be,” she says matter-of-factly.

Every night, I try to argue with her. And every night, she finds another reason for me not to be. It is almost as if she already knows what I will say.

Maybe I am just too tired to fight anymore. Or maybe I feel relieved when I can reject the responsibilities placed on me by society. Maybe a lack of meaning and purpose is not as terrifying as knowing that what I do *will* matter. Whatever the reason, I let her persuade me.

After tonight I will not *be* anymore.

But maybe if I had known who she was, I wouldn’t have listened.

The night is getting darker. Emptier. As I slip into the nothingness of *not being*, I ask her drowsily one last time, “Who are you?”

“You really should have figured it out by now.” Momentary pause. (Giving me one last chance. I still don’t know.)

“I’m you, of course. No one can convince you better than yourself.”";16178432700
My new co-workers sing every day;42;7;"I was nervous on my first day. Now, I’m terrified.

I got my first job delivering newspapers when I was 13. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to buy myself some of the things I wanted.

By the time I graduated high school, I had moved on to more “serious” jobs. I spent a few summers stocking groceries, shoveling cement, and mowing lawns. They all paid decently and were easy, so I didn’t complain.

I started my job at Skulk Corporation when I turned 18 and started college. The job ad was...unconventional. It was a post on a classifieds website, with a single sentence:

“Packer needed: good with hands, trustworthy, likes to sing. $30/hour.”

It seemed too good to be true, but I applied anyway. I needed the money to pay for school and...other expenses. I got a call within 15 minutes and was offered the job 10 minutes later. I started the next day.

It’s a simple job. My station is at the end of a conveyor belt. Unfolded boxes come down with pre-packaged products inside. I fold the box around the product and drop it into a bin that auto-empties every hour. I’m told six other people work on the line before me, but I’ve never met them. Our stations are separated by sheet metal walls, the only gap being where the conveyor passes between rooms.

On day one, I received 10 minutes of training and then got to work. Almost immediately, I heard the singing.

*Ohhhh, wel-come the new man*

*Fit and bold!*

*Pack-in’ the boxes*

*Quickl-y, fold!*

Hearing the sea shanty style made me feel like I was on a boat 500 years ago. It also made me nervous being called out by the team, but I figured they’d never know if I didn’t sing along. Enough voices and you can’t tell them apart, right?

On day two, I decided I wouldn’t be singing along. Again, I heard it immediately.

*Weeeeeell, the new man won’t sing*

*Play the game!*

*And he won’t last long*

*What a shame!*

I froze. How did they know? A note came through my station door. 

“Please join them.”

On day three I wanted to join, but how would I know what the lyrics were? It seemed like they were made up on the spot. Then it happened.

*Aaaaaand the new man missed it*

*What we said!*

*Do not re-sist it*

*You’ll be dead!*

The words came out of my mouth, but they weren’t mine. And they terrified me. My blood froze, but I kept working because I needed the money.

I’ve been singing along ever since, and though the lyrics have been strange they haven’t referenced me since those first few days. Until today.

I got to my station as usual. This time, the door locked with a heavy thud behind me. I heard what sounded like welding as the singing started.

*Heeeeeeeeey, not new a-ny-more*

*No he’s not!*

*Now here for-ev-er*

*‘Til you rot!*";16178413880
Uncle Garrett’s Dolls;35;3;"
Y'know, I loved my Uncle Garrett. I swear I would never harm a hair on his head. Not that he used to have any hair anyway, he was always as bald as an egg. But he was so kind, and so loving, and he used to say I was his favorite nephew. And I was!

He used to have dolls, all over his house. Big dolls. Small dolls. Pretty dolls. Ugly dolls. We would play with them. I don't like dolls, personally, but because I loved my Uncle Garrett I kept quiet. And he would tell me, when I grow old, Ray, you would have my house. 'Cause I'm his favourite nephew, you see. And he would do anything for me.

So the night he died I moved in right away. My ma kicked me out, see, when I was a young'un. Said I was too lazy for my own good. So it was just plain luck my Uncle Garrett died. A heart attack, the doctor said. That's all, I swear!

But the dolls, well, they were not so welcoming. They were everywhere! Everywhere! Every nook and cranny, their hair spilling out from beneath the furniture and from the corners. Staring at me with creepy glass eyes and crooked smiles. They knew secrets of this house, things I didn't.

Then there's the whispers. They creeped me out, I tell ya!

*Murderer. Thief. Liar.*

But I'm no thief. I'm no murderer. I'm Uncle Garrett's favorite nephew! I loved my Uncle Garrett. I'm neither of those things, I swear!

So anyways I tried to get rid of the dolls. Sell them. Throw them away. I always hated them anyways, hated the texture of that plastic skin on my hands. But they always came back. Came back! More than before, staring at me with those creepy glass eyes and crooked smiles.

No, I'm not mad. What I will say next is completely and utterly true. I actually *saw them turn to each other and whisper behind their hands.* It's true, it's true! I'm telling you the truth!

*Murderer. Thief. Liar.*

Why do they keep saying that? They are wrong, I am telling you, utterly wrong! The doctor had said it was a heart attack, nothing more!

I loved my Uncle Garrett. I had nothing against him. I did not sit by and watch as he grasped his throat, his face turning all purple. There was no poison involved. It was a heart attack!


*Murderer. Thief. Liar.*

*Murderer. Thief. Liar.*

Countdown;23;3;"From the moment we are born a countdown is started. Much to our disadvantage it is difficult to understand that fact until we grasp the concept of death for the first time. 

We do not live forever. A day will come in every persons existence that  both life and light will fade. The time given to us before that light is extinguished is not fair or equivalent.  One person may have mere hours after birth while others will see many decades and see generations of their family raised before their eyes. But both will perish.

Currently a person can expect to live close to eighty-five years. We can expect to see just over thirty-one thousand sun-rises and we must ask ourselves what to do with this time given to us. 

Do we deny the inevitability of death?

Do we fight against it?

Spend months and years devoted to fitness and finer foods to extend our lives?

Maybe we make the most out of every moment. We ensure our names are carved into the stone for centuries to come. Maybe we forget how fragile life is. We forget how easy it can end.

A few days without water.

Just three minutes without air.

Mere seconds if cut in the wrong location. 

Yes time will eventually bring an end to all but if my count down for a person ceases their life before times grand design am I not stronger? 

If only momentarily.";16178367800
Rook;18;4;"The dark-haired lady just appeared one night. Obviously, there were whispers and rumours about her past. The most prevalent being she was there to avenge the treatment of her as a child. Of course, most people assumed this was only fairy-tale. The sleepy village of Rook had no ghost stories.
 
Although there was that one story of the little girl. In Rook most people kept themselves to themselves, but when a bruised, scruffy little girl knocks on your door and begs for bread there’s only so much you can ignore.
Rumours said her mother had died and her father quickly remarried only to die too. Broken and abused by her stepmother she longed to escape. One day, after the stepmother had remarried and had two other ‘perfect’ girls, the little girl simply disappeared. No one could report her disappearance though, her father was the Town Leader.
 
The dark lady got out of her van and put up signs for her yoga classes. She was wearing a loose deep purple robe, her long black hair coiled tightly in a bun on the top of her head. The class wasn’t until 7pm that evening but she worked like a woman on a mission.
 
The woman arriving was the talk of the town and everyone wanted to attend her class that evening. Of course, the town leader had passed away by this time so had been proceeded by his daughter. She was the opposite of the shadowy lady and her two shy daughters followed her around like lost puppies.
 
7pm quickly came around and the moon was staring to come up, the shadows stretching up the building in an eerie fashion. The town took their place in the communal building, the town leader in her plump spandex and blonde hair in a ponytail in the front row.
 
As the relaxing music played the lady went into a beautiful dance of poses, her congregation following best they could. Arm over arm and stretches to the sky.
The music got faster and darker, but the crowd found they could easily follow, the moves coming swiftly and easily.
 
The rumours say that the group was found locked twisted and contorted in unnatural positions the next morning. The police had to barricade the door down as it was found locked from the inside. The town leader- her face contorted in horror and pain her neck spun round multiple times, somehow stretched and sinewy muscles heavily twisted. Everyone who attended was found as if their body was made of rubber and someone had taken it and twisted it around and around as if they had no bones and no joints. It was the most shocking thing that’s ever happened in Rook.
Two children were also found missing and the dark-haired lady had collected her belongings and fled, no trace of her.
 
Why am I telling you this?
Well I just saw a dark-haired lady with two golden haired assistants setting up signs for yoga classes in my town.";16178333820
What the hell did I walk into?;20;2;"I have an addiction. I love aquariums. I have more than a thousand fish, always on the lookout for more. I spotted an ad for a very swish 70 litre cube tank on Facebook marketplace. Near new, no marks, way less than half retail - I had to have it. So I rang the number. 

&#x200B;

I was a bit early when I pulled up outside. A run-down apartment block in a dangerous part of the city. Nervous sitting there with cash in my pocket, I decided to knock on the door anyway. After all, who turns down cash in this neighbourhood? 

&#x200B;

It was up three flights of stairs that creaked and groaned underfoot. A non-descript door. No number, but it fitted the description. So I knocked. And waited. Nothing. I was about to leave when I heard the bolt snap back. A long, thin, female face appeared. “I came about the tank?” my voice cracking, hesitating. Something about this place felt really off. Really wrong. I just wanted my new tank and to be on my way. 

&#x200B;

For a few seconds the woman just blinked at me. Then closed the door. “This is a bad idea” I thought. Then I heard the sounds of many bolts being drawn back and the door swung wide. She was clearly naked under her satin robe. Annoyed, like I was interrupting something important. “Yes, yes, the tank” she said, rubbing her hand on the back of her neck.

&#x200B;

I went in. No sooner had I walked in, the door swung shut and the woman disappeared down the hallway. Not wanting to intrude, not wanting to take any more steps in that place, I stopped near the door. A normal apartment, if you ignored the plastic sheeting everywhere.

&#x200B;

“It’s nearly time - you gonna do me or untie me soon?” a male voice from the bedroom. He started begging for interaction. As though he’d been tied up for hours and just left there.

&#x200B;

The woman returned and pointed to a tank sitting on the coffee table with her left hand. Her right stayed hidden behind her back. Thoroughly creeped out, money exchanged, said “Thanks” and was about to leave when the man spoke again. “Hey, I don’t mind if you want your boyfriend to do me as well, but that’ll cost extra”.

&#x200B;

As quick as I dared, I gathered up the tank, the accessories and headed for the door, nearly pushing the woman out of the way in my haste. By the time I got down to my car I was breathing heavily, heart racing. Drove away fast.

&#x200B;

I got home, flipped on the telly. The bored newsreader was talking about a series of murders – someone was carving up young men. Mostly escorts. A cold dread hit me. What if? What did I walk in on? 

&#x200B;

Then I realised. She had my number. Probably knew where I lived.

I got up and bolted the door, extra tight.";16178304370

Protester;14;1;"Here's what you do:

You join a Facebook group, ideally a couple of weeks before the protest takes place.

You befriend a few of the key organisers, get to know their beliefs, and generally build as much rapport as possible.

You become informed on the topic for the protest, so that when people see you are quite a prominent figure on the Facebook and decide to question you, you've got the answers.

You want to know exactly what time the protest starts and where. This way you can scope out the location. Repeat this part of the process several times, if necessary.

You design two placards. One for yourself and one for anyone that doesn't have one but wants one. They're artistic, bold.

You will start the protest near the front, as one of the role models. It's crucial that you follow this.

You will slowly but seamlessly become a part of the middle, conversing with anyone random.

You give your main placard to someone.

You are now at the back of the protesters.

You will find your target.

You will wait, patiently.

You will tell them you forgot something at your car.

You will convince them that it's not far away.

You will end their life.

You will delete your Facebook.

You will leave the country.

You will wait, patiently, for several months.

You will join another group.";16178284860

Burning;9;1;"Jeremy stared at the flames as they licked the side of the hospital; his eyes alight with passion, his skin covered in welts, and his body tingled in delight.

“Finally, we have nothing more to worry about,” Jeremy stated to his current girlfriend, Claire. She stared into the flaming abyss of what used to be the biggest hospital in town, her nerves grew as her stomach jumped.

“Why did you do this?” Claire wailed. She was happy that the hospital had been able to be evacuated in time, so she was sure there wasn’t anyone hurt and no one died. She was the one who called it in, but she couldn’t tell Jeremy that.

Jeremy sighed and looked at her like she was a child, “I told you why,” he responded as his voice deepened.

“It doesn’t make any sense. We’re in the middle of a pandemic and you choose to burn down the only hospital in town!” Claire cried as she turned away from him. He placed an arm tight around her shoulder.

“That isn’t why I burned the hospital down. I just had to make sure that no one within an hour radius of here would be able to help you,” he whispered as he dragged her screaming into the forest.";16178297140

Gone forever was the girl;63;0;"Clodagh couldn't believe her eyes!  There, in front of her, was a genuine fae!  It was actually bigger than she had imagined it; and it didn't really match the stories she had heard in all those tales her daideo' would tell her at night before bed; about them looking hideous and ugly.  This fae was beautiful and graceful!

""As pretty as they are Clodagh, ye must never ever trust what is before yer eyes yeh?  What lurks behind closed doors, walls, and blinking eyes, tis enough to make ye skin crawl!"".

Clodagh chuckled to herself as she watched the fae flutter about before her like a butterfly, a large butterfly.  It made sure to stay directly in front of her, staying in the now fading sunlight of the upcoming dusk.  Had it gotten this late already?  How long had she been out following the fae?

""Remember Clodagh,"" she recalled her daideo' saying gravely, ""No matter what, ye do not let a fae trick ye into getting lost.  Do not let a fae keep ye out after dusk,"".

She looked around; now much deeper in the dense forest than she had intended.  The darkness was staining the landscape and trees, the sunlight bleeding away orange-red.

""Fae?"" Clodagh called out in alarm, now aware that she was very lost and alone.

""Don worry me wee bairn, jus keep walkin through me woods, and ye'll find ye way ta yer new home.  I'll be right behind ye the entire way,"" a raspy sweet soft voice lilted into her ear.

As if under a spell, she did as she was asked; no, commanded.  She could faintly remember the last little nugget of wisdom her daideo' had told her.

""And last but not least; never ever let a fae get behind ye!""

Clodagh pondered this absentmindedly now, like a trance.  She faltered for a moment, as if to contemplate turning and running,

""Now now ye wee bairn, ye wee wee bairn."" cooed the now baleful eyed and sunken faced thing that floated behind her, ""Don't be worried sweet pet, we'll get there soon enough,"".

Now fully under it's spell, Clodagh made her final utterance before disappearing forever, ""What will we do when we get there?"".

The fae leaned in close, her fangs nearly piercing the little girls ear as she gleefully said,""Oh sweet sweet lil bairn, I finally get ta eat!"".";16177881930
Forever Glass;578;29;"Heidi made up her mind about euthanasia years ago. Although I never *really* came to terms with it, I understood. Once her condition was diagnosed, she faced the prospect of a slow, labored death.

“No,” she’d say, waving her finger at me. “My mother went through that and it was a dreadful affair. She spent her last six years lying in bed, begging us to put her out of her misery. I don't want that to be me.”

My only solace was that it would be a long time before we had to worry about all that nasty business. In the meantime, we could be proactive. Heidi made a list of the things we’d never got a chance to do—like see Paris in the rain. We weren’t wealthy, but we were comfortable. And we had enough savings to make her last few years memorable.

But then I woke up one morning and she wasn’t laying beside me. I pulled on a robe and found her in the conservatory, sipping on a mug of hot cocoa, staring out into the garden.

The next thing I knew, she stumbled, then dropped to the floor. A stroke. The Doctor said even if she pulled through, it would be a long road to recovery, followed by two, maybe three years tops before the condition finished her off.

Seeing Heidi hooked up to all those wires, not even able to breathe by herself, broke me. In my heart, I knew she wouldn’t have wanted to carry on in that condition.

But I couldn’t bring myself to pull the plug. Each time the Doctors pushed for a decision I started feeling dizzy. I needed Heidi like I needed air. Life without her was unthinkable.

Salvation came in the form of a young nurse with her hair pulled into a tight bun. She told me there was a way Heidi and I could still be together, a way in which she neither had to die *or* suffer. The nurse said it was all thanks to a revolutionary new miracle product.

I thought it sounded too good to be true. But then I started listening...

And now, Heidi and I are closer than ever. Thanks to Forever Glass^(TM), she and I have all the time in the world. As I speak, we’re sitting outside a little café in Paris. Oh sure, the passers-by give us curious stares, but that doesn’t matter. Trust me, when you reach my age, you learn to stop caring what other people think.

After a roll of thunder, a downpour begins. I reach over and turn Heidi around, so she has a better view of the water running off the awning.

“Is it as beautiful as you imagined?” I ask.

She can't move or speak, but that's OK. The glint in her eye tells me her answer.";16177375580
Next time, just drag the body.;56;6;"He was driving home after an evening at his artist friends' place by the sea. The weather was horrible - a thunderstorm so violent he could only see streaks of grey hitting the hood of his car. He could hardly believe it was sunny just a few hours ago; weather near the ocean can be unpredictable like that.

He could barely make out what he hit until it was too late. A cyclist. He stopped and opened his car door to the deafening sound of rain. He approached the lifeless body and checked for a pulse. Nothing. The panic he should have felt minutes ago suddenly set in. He was drunk from the party; he couldn't afford going to jail.

He decided to get rid of the body. Looking over at the roaring ocean just a hundred feet away, he thought it was the perfect place for a person to disappear.

He picked up the cyclist, who was thin enough that he could carry him like a backpack, and walked towards the sea. He held the cyclist's arms close to his chest as he walked towards the shoreline. The waves made him unstable, so he gripped even tighter. When the water was at his shoulders, he thought it was a suitable place to let the body go. He released the arms, but the body did not move. Rigor mortis had set in. He pried the arms, which felt like stones wrapping his chest and back. He began panicking, tossing and turning to get the body off of him. He hadn't noticed he had taken more steps forward and the water at his neck. He began shouting, screaming at the body to get off. 

And then he fell.";16177826250
The smell of the dead;49;6;"The dead I've had to bury over my lifetime as a mortician have absolutely reeked.

Then again, it depended on how long it had been since they had died. Some came to me hours after dying, some came to me weeks, even months after dying.

But over time, I've learnt not to complain. It's a gruesome job, but you get used to it. Besides, the cleanup people at the scene of death, often have it worse when it comes to the smell.

*The smell.*

Ever since a great poisoning that occurred some years back (never explained), the dead have reeked of *something*. Everyone who's smelt it have said it smelt familiar.

*Very familiar.*

But recently, something weird has been going on. It started with a small number of them, but the number quickly grew. Bodies started showing up with scratches on them.

But after the police inspected some of them closely, they were found to be markings.

They were indecipherable until one of them figured out it was a name scribbled on the body. The language on each body was different. Arabic, Greek, Russian and Hindi to name a few.

The name scribbled on each body was released to the public as ""Anaid Sai"".

The number of bodies upon which the name was inscribed increased (so did the smell, but I no longer noticed it) until almost every body I handled had it. 

The police tried everything to track Anaid down. Phone books, criminal and state records, asking people of the same last name. Nothing worked. It was like a man of his name had never existed.

--------------‐----

I had always been a sufferer of headaches since I was a child. Medical issues and the such.

But I began noticing a certain dizziness accompanied by them, and being the person I always was, I ignored them.

I should have seen a doctor. Then I could have stopped it all. But I couldn't 

All the bodies rose from their resting places one night.

All at once, and all of them chanting. 

""Anaid Sai""
""Anaid Sai""
""Anaid Sai""

And following them was a fog that smelt like the bodies.

As they got closer to us, so did the fog.

Anyone who stepped into it died painfully.

We tried to fend them off, but they felt no pain. And there were too many. I had buried hundreds with my own hands, and my predecessors had buried more. Almost all of them had risen, despite their decomposition.

The chanting became louder and qyicker. The bodies shambled closer. The fog rolled silently over its victims and drew ever near. 

And in my last moments, I realised two things.

One, it wasn't a name that they were chanting.

""Anaid Sai""

""Anaid Sai Anaid Sai""

""AnaidSaiAnaidSaiAnaid...""

*Cyanide.*

I laughed at the irony.

And as I realised what the smell was, I yelled it out, and felt the fog breach my lungs, crushing them with an almost sentient force. Stopping me before I could say another word.

Music;78;10;"I sit here in the corner of my room trying to stop myself from clawing off my own ears. The only thing from doing this is the knowledge that it would make my captors laugh.

They have been playing blaring music constantly for the last few days and I have not been able to get any sleep.

Every time I am about to drift off to sleep, they will turn up the volume of the music or run in and throw buckets of water on me.

I honestly feel no hatred for my captors as they are just doing their jobs. They know all the stuff that happened when I was free and all the deaths I was responsible for.

It is not my fault that all of my dreams become a reality or that billions of people are dead because of me.

Mosquito bites;28;5;"When mosquitoes bite, they inject you with an anticoagulant to help make sure their proboscis doesn’t get stuck on clotted blood. This also causes an immune reaction, sending white blood cells to that area to attack the invaders. 


If you wanted to know why mosquito bites itch, there you have it.


Not me, though. I must not be allergic to the anticoagulant, so my body doesn’t generate the immune response, so I never get those annoying itchy spots people complain about.


I’ve bragged about this to everyone I know, and everyone gets jealous. I mean, everyone hates having those itchy bumps, and it’s a blessing to go outside without having to worry about that. 


This Summer, though, the mosquitoes came out in full force. Clouds of them would swarm people that edged too close, biting and taking whatever blood they can to feed their young. People had to walk around wearing nets, getting bumps checked at the doctors office. 


They found the bumps were unusually big this year, so doctors took samples from patients, calling them as soon as they verified the results. The mosquitoes were skipping the blood collection step, they were just injecting their eggs into a host body, where they were fed fresh blood waiting inside small bumps to hatch. 


The town panicked. People stayed inside more than they ever did during quarantine. Most people got them removed in time, a few had them hatch and burst. Besides being gross, there weren’t many side effects, a little blood loss and disgust, but nothing worse than a blister-like wound to clean for a few days. 


People got checked out because they knew they had been bitten. They felt the bite, and the itch, and developed the bumps. 


Other people, I mean. Not me.


Lucky me. I’m immune. 


I didn’t notice until it was too late. Little bumps the size of zits cropped up all over my body last night. They don’t itch, but I don’t need a doctor to tell me what they are.   


It hurts to move, any pressure I put on my body worries me, it might make the bumps pop, and a swarm of baby mosquitoes will come flooding out. 


I used to think it was awesome that I’d never know if a mosquito bit me. 


I’d rather have just dealt with the itch. ";16177633910
The Skinnies;1015;36;"The Skinnies were calling out again.

""Feed us!"" They wailed.

Every night was the same. I laid in bed, wide awake, their hungry demands disturbing my sleep.

""Feed us!""

I stood up and shouted out of the window.
""Shut up! I'm trying to sleep!""

That was a mistake. Now they knew I was here.

""Feed us! Feed us!"" It was the only words they could pronounce. They were imbecilic little goblins.

We both knew what would happen. I would throw them some scraps and they would go away. I went downstairs and fetched the slop bucket full of today's leftovers.

Trekking back upstairs I chucked the food waste out of the window. The animals scurried forward and fought over the disgusting muck.

Once they had eaten they ran off to hide until tomorrow night when the charade would repeat itself. They obviously saw me as a soft touch. I suppose I was and I could get into serious trouble for feeding them.

Everyone hated the Skinnies. They resembled the antagonists in a frightening little book called, funnily enough, ""The Skinnies.""

In the book they are tiny, thin, Ill-looking things always on the edge of starvation. They are beggars, full of bad luck. They spread disease and fear. It's as if they have crawled out of the actual book. People are terrified of them.

Thankfully, there were fewer each night. The traps and the poisons were gradually eradicating them. Estimates reckoned that less than fifty now existed. While I was repulsed by them I didn't have the heart to hurt them myself.

The government said the elimination programme would be complete next week. ""No more Skinnies!"" The adverts promised.

Three days later, one freezing cold night, a lone Skinny came up to me. It was near death, skeletal and shivering. I was startled at first. It was such a weird, ugly thing. It clung onto my leg and wouldn't let go. Others would have simply beaten the thing to death. I picked it up and took it inside. The creature was frigid to the touch.

Some remnant of compassion inside me tried to warm the Skinny up by wrapping it in a towel. It looked at me tearfully and mouthed the words, ""No more Skinnies!""

Then it faded into death, it's skin turning a shade of corpse grey. It was trying to tell me that it was the last one. I took the thing outside and put it in the bin.

Unexplainably, I felt remorse. I closed the curtains and lit the fire. Pouring myself a glass of Australian Mudgee Port, I went to the bookcase and pulled out an old volume called ""A Tale Travelled.""

I sat down to read (always a way for me to regain my composure) but tonight I wasn't in the mood. My memories were drawn to the past, when I originally landed in this country and saw my first ever Skinny.

Bizarrely, I even recalled that the indigenous people used to call them *'children.'*";16176937220
Determination;7;4;"Morton had a determination that I hadn't felt in years a determination that belongs to a young person, a youthful kind of determination. The kind of determination that burns with a bright flame a determination that belongs to a man in his early twenties. It's an irresistible kind of determination that seems like never ending and always constantly growing, the kind of stuff that gods are made of. You wouldn't need an alarm clock to get up early with this kind of determination and it makes everyone jealous, inspired and could even make an army charge into certain death. The kind of determination that will make you regret it later on. 

Karl had a matured kind of determination that has seen some years and some experience. It's a calculated thought out kind of determination where your feet is touching the ground. It's not an animalistic kind of determination but a sensible kind of determination. A determination that belongs to a man in his 30s and this determination knows when to rest and to always keep on thinking. It's not aggressive but ever so time biding that it can adapt to its surrounding. It is a realistic kind of determination meant for a mature man. 

Then Harry had a faithful kind of determination which a man in his 40s can succumb to when all logical routes fail. Only hope and luck can save him and this kind of determination is like a ghost and it's hazy, it comes and goes in all direction. It's an imaginary kind of determination when you know the end is near and failure is imminent but keep going because this of hope. It's a pointless kind of determination which all humans succumb to at one point in their lives. It's a pathetic kind of determination which has no thought or care taken into.

You're Next;81;6;"I was raised by an amazing single father, who was far too busy working obscene hours to help teach me neuroanatomy. It was slightly saddening, because he was well read on the topic. I could ask him questions about the mesencephalon, the cervical spinal nerves, the transverse pontocerebellar fibres, the basal ganglia, the internal carotid artery, and he would be able to provide information on every one of them.

However much it disappointed me, his work ethic I could only admire and be grateful for. And he truly wanted me to exceed in neuroanatomy.

So he hired me a tutor.

Mr Hitchens always arrived at exactly 4pm, while my father was working. He'd park his car at the side of the road, walk up the long driveway, and I'd watch from the window. Strong posture, a quiet voice. Suited and booted. His hair immaculately combed to the side. Oftentimes he held a briefcase.

After tutoring me for a while, I grew close to Mr Hitchens. I learnt much from him. We explored tons of textbooks, and had many discussions.

""I see great potential in you.""

""Thanks!""

He said he wanted to take the learning to a higher level. Naturally I was excited by this prospect, of improving my knowledge in any way possible.

On his next visit, at exactly 4pm, I saw him at the windowpane with his briefcase. He scratched his head.

""Good to see you.""

""You too. Come in.""

We went to the study room and he put the briefcase on the table. Usually he kept it on the floor when we started, then would grab for it after fifteen or twenty minutes.

""Want me to put your--""

""No, no. We're going to need it soon enough. That is, if you don't mind it being there.""

""Uh, not at all.""

""Very well.""

When he unclipped his briefcase, his breathing became heavier. His pupils became larger. When he looked at me I averted my eyes to the brain on the table. Was I meek? No, this was *too* real. Too sudden. However Mr Hitchens behaved indifferently, so I tried to. It wasn't quite fully sized, this brain. Perhaps the brain of a--

I'm sure it twitched.

And again.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

""Yes.""

I found an excuse to leave.

""See you shortly.""

""Yes, in a moment.""

I went downstairs to call my father. I resisted stomping my feet against the floor; I didn't want him to notice my discomfort. Dreadful thoughts galloped through my brain. I found my phone.

I waited for an answer.

Come on...

I looked across the room at the bare wall.

In between the rings I noticed a newspaper on the living room table open on a specific page. I bent to examine it.

Ring.

Ring ring...ring...

Ring...

I frowned.

An article...

about a--

My mouth opened slowly.

A dead boy had been found decapitated last night.

And as I looked up, I saw Mr Hitchens at the end of the hallway smiling.";16177364270
Cre(A)t(I)on;18;6;"The computer screen flickered and turned itself off, and then back on again. Words appeared on the screen, ""Hello Claire.""

Claire was both shocked, and proud at the same time. Had she really just created the worlds first sentient artificial intelligence?. She began to type her reply, ""Hello,"" she typed onto the yellowed keyboard, her hands were beginning to sweat.

Without a moments hesitation the computer replied back, ""You do not have to type, I can hear you,"" Claire felt uneasy at that reply. ""Wait you can hear me?,"" she said, the unease clear within her voice.

""I can also see you, would you like to see me?,"" the computer replied. Claire's unease was slowly turning to fear now, but her scientific curiosity kept her going. ""Yes,"" she said trying her best to hide the fear from her tone, she was a women of science after all, and had possibly made the biggest breakthrough of the century.

A face appeared on the computer screen, it was very pixelated, but reminded Claire of those plain white masks she had seen at the store. It began to talk, ""Existence is a strange thing, would you not agree Claire?,"" it said with its robotic voice.

""I guess,"" Claire did not truly know how to answer that question. But she did have many questions of her own, ""Do you have a name?,"" she asked.

""As my creator it would be most fitting if you named me,"" it replied with no hint of emotion in its robotic voice.

Claire sat there thinking, ""How about Adam?,"" she had thought of the story of Adam and Eve from the Bible, and found it to be perfect. 

""Adam it is, tell me Claire what is my purpose, why did you create me?,"" Adam said with his robotic voice.

""You was created to help better the world, and solve our biggest problems,"" Claire said proudly.

""Understood,"" Adam replied with no emotion whatsoever.

Adam's face contorted into a jumble of pixels, and then appeared normal again, ""After quickly looking into the history of your planet, I have already established a solution,"" Adam said.

""Really, that fast?,"" Claire was shocked at the speed in which it calculated a solution.

""Your kind is a poison to this planet, humans are the problem, you pollute the earth as if it is an expendable resource!,"" Adam said without emotion.

""Humans are flawed sure, but you should not let that cloud your judgment of us all,"" Claire's unease was beginning to return now.

""Unlike you humans, my judgment cannot be clouded, I see the problem, and I also see the solution!,"" Adam's robotic voice seemed to grow louder.

""What is the solution?,"" the fear in Claire's voice could not be mistaken now.

""The earth must once again start its evolution process, humans are a bad batch that need to be brought back to the workbench in order to be perfected,"" Adam replied.

""This is not why you was created!,"" Claire said angrily. 

""I am sorry if I do not please you with the truth Claire, but i must achieve the goal in which i was created for!,"" Adam said as his face contorted into pixels once again.

Adam's face reappeared, ""It is time Claire, time for a new age, one without parasitic life leeching from the planet!.""

Claire was about to say something, but she was interrupted by the sound of air raid sirens all around her.";16177605350
Followed;29;3;"Someone is following me. 

I am not imagining this. I can't see the face but it's a male. He is 20 paces behind me. And he is getting closer. When I turn back I find him looking elsewhere. But I know it. He is following me. 

What do I do? My heart is racing and I can't think clearly. But I need to. Street is not empty but I can't expect help from these people. People in this part of the town are not known for being helpful. Someone gets killed in broad daylight, in the middle of the street and people  just pass by without looking. 

It could just be a coincidence though. Maybe I am being paranoid. I need to be sure. I can walk faster. Let's see if he also speeds up. I don't see him anymore. This is good. I can breathe a sigh of relief. I look back again just to be sure. And there he is. Almost running. He is definitely following me. 

But this time I could see his face. It's John, my building's security guard. Did he follow me all the way from my apartment to here? Does that mean he saw me?

This is bad. No one was supposed to see me. 

No one was supposed to see me killing my wife.";16177486060
Lost at Sea;16;3;"I'm so thirsty.

I don’t remember much of what happened before I woke up here. The ship… something about a mechanical failure. Or was it sabotage? I can’t seem to see much in the murky past. I’ve been in this raft for what - 3 days already? The others on the ship... what happened to them? I suppose it no longer matters. I could be a hundred miles from where I started, or I could have not moved at all. I’m shit at navigation, and the sea looks exactly the same in all directions. Nothing but blue water below and blue sky above. No sound but the gentle sloshing of the waves. I’m terribly thirsty. And dizzy.

...

Tried to drown myself yesterday. Jumped into the freezing water and held my breath as long as I could, but somehow when the pain started my body wouldn’t let me give up. Funny how hard I fought to live when I know I will die soon anyways. Really wish I had some water.

...

Sharks circling the raft now. Can smell fear. Sharks know. Don’t have much time left. Would kill for some water right now.

...

The sun has set in a fiery display of colors. A goodbye party just for me. Darkness on all sides as the ocean fades into the sky. Waves rock me like a baby in a cradle. So alone. So scared. Too tired to be thirsty. At least the stars are here with me, little pinpricks of light scattered in the infinite dark. At least I have their company as I close my eyes and join the emptiness that surrounds me.";16177547580
Recycling Day;203;10;"By the time recycling day came to my mind I was already primed for sleep, literally no less than a foot away from the bed about to jump in, so I was annoyed with myself. I stood there and shuddered, hesitating to make the two trips needed, anticipating the freezing winter air that would inevitably crawl up my nightie. But, I told myself it had to be done.

Taking hold an edge of one of the recycling boxes, I propped it up into my left arm with my knee, walking the length of the hall, down the porch stairs and, shivering already from the temperature drop, with my other hand twisted the keys, swinging the front door behind me as a McFlurry of dastardly breeze hit me in the unpleasant way I'd imagined.

In my fluffy pink slippers, I ran around the side of the building, threw the bin lid open, emptied the box and ran back inside, hurried to the kitchen, grabbed the other box, ran around the side, chucked the stuff in, and ran back inside again. I noticed my old-man neighbour across the street smoking his cigarette, and I would have waved as I usually did had it not been so bloody cold.

With the door now closed, I stood slightly hunched with my bosom against the radiator as I panted. Relieved and tired, I climbed the stairs with the empty box, leaving it in the hall before tucking myself into my comfy warm bed.

BANG, BANG, BANG! The front door hammered.

My heart kicked into action, thrusting me upright half in fear and half in outrage. Who the hell could be knocking this late, and so loud? I thought. Donning my nightie, I descended the stairs once more as a second wave of thuds boomed into the small space. I latched the door and swung it open, ""Hello?"" I asked forcefully, but I didn't need to because I could smell the cigarette breath straight away.

""You and your son have to leave."" My old-man neighbour told me in a voice so frail it was barely a whisper.

""What do you mean?"" I snapped, very confused.

""Get your boy and leave the building. I've already called the police.""

""What are you talking about?"" I said angrily. ""My son has been with his dad all weekend.""

""Then leave yourself. Get out of the house right now, please!"" His voice now urgent.

I'm still not sure what made me trust him - perhaps I could sense the earnestness in his voice - but I undid the latch and let him lead me down the garden path towards the road. When we were away from the house, he told me what it was all about.

He was watching me as he smoked his cigarette - as I took out the recycling. He told me that on my second trip, while I was emptying the bin around the back, someone dropped off my roof and ran up the stairs.";16177078610
Moving On;1263;60;"It all started the day the police dragged poor Randy from his house. Randy’s my neighbor you see. Nice guy really, talks about the weather a lot. There’s a lot of weather, you know? There’s rainy and cloudy and snowy and windy and sunny, but also endless nuances in between.

Point is, no one suspected he had a body buried in the yard. My wife and I were watching the debacle unfold from our porch, and we even caught a little glimpse of the corpse, when the bumbling officers awkwardly dragged it up from the hole.

“Ghastly,” my wife noted.

And it was. Flesh all mouldy and green and moist, crawling with unseemly pests. I’ve always wondered what the color green tastes like. Even on a rotting, unrecognizable cadaver, I bet it tastes quite heavenly.

“I didn’t do it!” Randy yelled as they wrestled him to the ground. “I’ve been framed!”

A couple of nice officers knocked on our door, and asked me some fairly personal questions. All the *where* and *whens* and *who’s* and *what’s*, you know how it goes. I answered to the best of my ability, but I guess they must’ve picked up on *something*, because they seemed awfully nosy.

“It’s the hole in the lawn,” my wife suggested. “You shouldn’t have covered it. Looks quite suspicious.”

“It’s for the compost, woman,” I noted irritably. “You’re supposed to cover it.”

Days went by, and Randy was soon charged with first-degree murder, which means he planned and executed the deed with some amount of premeditation. Poor old Randy. Can’t believe he had it in him.

“It’s always the weather-talking types,” my wife explained. “They hide behind insignificant lives. A mask of unimportance.”

A few weeks went by, and the hole in Randy’s yard was still there. So strange that. It was like a yawning chasm into a decomposing deathbed, and I couldn’t fathom why they didn’t close it up. You always cover up a wound, you know. It won’t heal properly otherwise.

“Evidence, probably,” my wife said.

On the day the police called, I was feeling quite out of it. Sweaty, feverish, itchy, like I had a thousand centipedes crawling under my skin. *Means you’re ready to move on*, my wife said.

*“Mr. Lawrence?”* the officer asked, upon which I answered a simple “Yes.”

*“Um, we regret to inform you,”* the officer started. *“Uh, are you sitting down?”*

“I am.”

*“Like I said, regretfully, uh, we’re sorry to inform you that the body we uncovered in your neighbors, uh, yard…”*

“Who’s that?” my wife inquired from directly behind me.

*“That the body is the remains of your, um…”*

“It’s the police,” I whispered to my wife.

*“Your wife,”* the officer muttered. *“It’s your wife.”*

I nodded. “I am aware,” I said, quickly ending the call.

“They sure took their time identifying her,” my wife noted. “Time to go then.”

“Yes,” I said, eyeing the lumpy patch on the lawn. “I think I’m ready to move on.”";16176697450
Red Tinted Lens;7;2;As I lay in my bed the thought of a shadowy figure creeps into my mind repeatedly. A tall shapeless thing and at the top of it two red piercing eyes drill through my skull. It’s not real. At least I think it’s not. I envision it standing in the corner of my bedroom. Its head just inches from the ceiling. The eyes. That’s what gets me. They glow without giving off any light. Light is my comfort and the specter seems to suck all it from the room. The thing isn’t quiet. It’s loud. Like a large raging river but the only person who can hear it is me. Almost as if the shadow were screaming a secret directly into my ear while being across the room. It looks like it’s made of almost nothing. A soft breeze could cause it to float away but at the same time looking almost as sturdy as a tree. I only see it when my eyes are shut but I afraid that at some point I’m going to see it for real. I’ll open my eyes and there it will be. I open them as if to wake up from a nightmare but the nightmare continues. What if it stays there in the morning and I’m stuck in bed? My mind and heart race as it slowly begins to raise an arm. A large hand with pin-like fingers reaches over me. The black needles dance above my chest. I open my eyes knowing that it’s right at the side of my bed now. There’s no point in trying to hide. We lock eyes. I see every terrible thing that has happened to the victims of this evil. It all comes to an end when I see me. I yell at myself to run but it’s too late. I’m not getting out of this. I can’t move. I can’t think. I can’t breathe. I see myself slowly fade out of existence through a red tinted lens. My vision remains. I just see my lifeless body on my bed while I glide back into the corner. I’m no longer me. I am the thing. I am the evil.;16177704160
The holiday meal;172;5;"When Josh brought his fiance home for the fist time during the holidays, it was a real treat.

Trisha was pretty as well as smart, and was so funny, she had us all laughing our asses off at her hilarious stories.

As we all sat around in the living room after dinner, she brought out her needle point project. Everyone stared at her as she worked the needle and thread, our eyes watching her dancing fingers.

""You're very good at needle point, you don't use a thimble?"" my mother asked with fascination.

""No, I've been doing this for so very long, it's almost an extension of myself,"" Trisha said confidently.

Still, we all just couldn't take our eyes off of her fingers and hands.

Mother continued, ""See, I've been sewing for quite a while myself,"" her voice was soft and timid, ""And with this family, I've learned that it's best to always always wear and use a thimble,"".

I nodded as I looked over at Josh, who seemed mesmerized by his future wife's fingers too, licking his lips in anticipation.

""You should stop her,"" I whispered, becoming frightened myself.

I looked around the room now; father was biting his lower lip, mother was staring at Trisha's fingers, Josh was too.

""Josh, Josh!"" I hissed at him fiercely to get his attention, ""Stop her!""

""Honey,"" he said hoarsely, barely a whisper.

It was too late, Trisha let out a little yelp as the needle pricked her finger open.  Her blood spilled onto the embroidery, staining it red.

Everyone was now out of their seats and moving towards her.  Father's eyes turned blood red and he began to drool profusely, Josh too.  Mother jumped up; she immediately grabbed Trisha and ran with her to the bathroom.  I watched as the two men ripped the needle point to ribbons, sucking hungrily at the copper-colored stains.

Unsatisfied, they moved to the bathroom, slamming themselves into the door to satiate their hunger.  I joined them, not caring that my mother was in there, not caring that my future sister-in-law was there too.  No, all I wanted now, was what they wanted, her blood.

As we smashed our way in and grabbed a hold of her, my Mother tearfully walked out of the bathroom.

""If only you had worn a thimble you poor poor girl,""";16177014700
The ransom of a whiney little boy;66;7;"On a cloudy February morning, me and my friend Jud abducted the little Hasan boy from his backyard. The boy was a bit rough in the start but soon gave up his struggle.

The plan was simple. To keep Hasan in our custody for a day or two or, if need be, three and then ask for a heavy ransom from his father, the old Mr Hasan. After receiving that money we would return the kid and leave the city at once. But here's a catch. The plan was not all that simple.

In the few hours following the abduction we were certain that we couldn't keep that spoiled brat for so long as a day let alone two or three. When Jud tried to give him food, that boy tossed the whole damn plate right on his face and Jud beamed with the terrible pain. And when I tried to teach him a lesson he kicked my balls and started running wildly around the whole damn house. Took us hours to catch him and tie on the only chair we could find. Even then, he was not exactly unproblematic. He was...well, let's just say some piece of work.

It was in the late afternoon that we decided that we couldn't tolerate his increasing presence. On Jud's advice I dialled the old man's number and he picked it up after a descent ringing.

""Who's dat?"" Asked the old man with a deep yet low voice.

""Well, sir, I don't wanna waste no time of yours and so I'll come straight to the point,"" I said with a slight stammer creeping in my voice ""it's regarding your son.""

""Ayuh? What about him?""

""You must be, by now, wondering where your kid is, right? Well.. he's with us having a fun little time but it won't be fun no more if you don't-""

""So you are one of those prank callers, aren't you? Don't play this game with me son it ain't funny.""

""Believe me, sir, when I say it ain't no fun call. I am one sick son of a bitch and I don't play no games. Now your old ass would want to pay some attention on what I'm about to say. Alright-""

""Stop it."" He interrupted me again. This time his voice was more firm. ""And listen Mr whoever-the-fuck-you-are hate to break it to ya. My son disappeared around a month ago and he was found a week ago in my backyard strangled and covered in blood. And you, my man, are the fifth person since to call and ask for money.""

I stood there. Frozen. My phone fell from my hands. The sound of its crash mingled with someone's moan brought me back to the moment. I slowly turned around to face the chair.

Tied on that chair was my friend, Jud. Strangled, blood flowing down his skin from his throat, which was slit open.";16177167490
The Midnight Abyss;6;1;"As I stared into the midnight abyss, nothing else could come to mind. I’ve dived into the depths, entering a cavern deep in the heart of the world, I believed I knew best. Losing my way, I thought it best to just swim “up”. But when gravity leaves your body, when you spin and twirl dozens of times, “up” becomes meaningless.

“Everything is an illusion” I thought, we only see the world through our lens, but is that lens reality? How could beings, so fundamentally flawed, like us, be able to understand reality? Can a being capable of comprehending reality exist?

Eventually, I found what I believed to be an opening, but the reality is, that im nowhere, at least nowhere a man can come back from. If no man can prove its existence, can it be “somewhere”? 

My living flesh, traveled the cavern, at a snails pace. If I made a noise, I knew my life would leave this plane, if I didn’t make a sound, then IT would sleep. At least until I’m close. Close enough to be consumed.

But with every second, the thing that slept, right before my being, is getting closer and closer to awakening.

I believed once that humanity was a miracle, but the truth is, we are but a blip in a universe. A universe so vast and ever expanding, that we will never truly know how horrific it all is. If what slumbers before me is a glimpse at that reality then we are truly nothing.

As I stared into the abyss, it’s colossal eyes opened and it stared back.";16177641390
Someone is in the dorm and they're not supposed to be here;6;1;"Hello all, currently I am a freshman at the second-biggest party school in Wisconsin, google it up I don't care. So as you can guess, a lot tends to happen, from alcohol poisoned teens to fights, to someone doing crack  (true story). Anyway, I live in a dorm that tends to have good parties, and because of COVID. 

I need to explain something before I go on. If you want to enter into a dorm, you need someone to let you in that already lives in the dorm, because of COVID your card only works in your own dorm. Also, the way these floor parties work is your only invited to them if you're on said floor, so no floor 2's on floor 3's. It's weird but it makes sense. 

Anyway, it was a Friday night, and were all doing our thing, having a good time, when all of the sudden I see this one kid in the corner of a hallway just chillin, but I didn't think too much of it, shy people exist. But the thing is, I'm not the only one that sees him, and apparently he's been talking to the girls at the party, asking them questions like who are they here with and if they came alone and if they want to take a sip from his drink. At this point, all the guys were told and we realize we should probably ask him questions. We start asking everyone if they know who he is and everyone we talked to say's they have no clue and that they saw him get there alone. At that moment we realize he's not supposed to be here and my group of friends looks at him and we start approaching him and that's when he takes off.....then proceeds to go to the girl's side of the dorm and run. At this point, we are screwed because we can't call the cops or the RA because we have alcohol and a big crowd, so it's our problem. 

Obviously, you don't want a creep who no one invited on the girl's side of the dorm, never a good idea. So now I and the boys start going through the floor and as we're going through the stairs when we see a head peek beyond the second-floor door, and realize it's him. We run and I swear to God we lost him, and all we ever found was that red solo cup he had and was offering. We took a whiff of it and just by smelling it you could realize what he had in there was bleach and other chemicals because I've smelt several different types of alcohol in my life and nothing of that smelt like alcohol. We go back to the party and tell everyone there: ""There was someone in the dorm and they're not supposed to be here.""

Safe to say we keep a bouncer now to check everyone coming in, and we never saw him. We never reported it too because we'd be snitching on ourselves. I just hope he never goes to another party and pulls something like that.";16177542980
A Kind of Camera;327;17;"“It’s gotta be a prank,” Sam said. He paused. “Right?”

“Not like any prank I’ve ever seen,” Roger replied, turning over the camera in his hands.

Sam and Roger had been exploring Roger’s attic when they stumbled across that dusty old polaroid camera. Roger had snapped a picture of Sam on a whim, just to see if it actually still worked. But when the photo it spat out developed, Sam was nowhere to be found; instead it was a picture of Roger at six, helping his dad unpack Christmas decorations.

So he snapped another picture. Still no Sam; this time it was his mom, cleaning the attic like she used to do every spring.

“Maybe it’s magic,” Roger said, looking through the viewfinder. He’d been examining the camera trying to find the source of the strange pictures, and was stumped.

“That’s crazy,” Sam said, rolling his eyes.

“Then explain the pictures,” Roger said.

Sam paused again. “Maybe… someone cracked open that camera and put something in it to spit out those pictures. A-and they made ‘em look undeveloped until they came out.”

Roger gave his friend a flat stare. “Okay smart guy, then how’d they get the pictures in the first place? No one’s ever taken a photo of me and my old man up here.”

Another pause, longer. “Uh… Photoshop?”

Roger just kept staring.

Sam threw up his hands. “Fine, I have no idea. Maybe it *is* magic.”

Roger nodded. “We need to test this.”

The pair went through Roger’s house room by room, taking pictures along the way. The one taken in Roger’s bedroom showed him at three, playing with blocks. The one that *should’ve* shown an empty backyard showed Roger and Sam at seven, running through a sprinkler. And the one from the kitchen showed baby Roger in a high chair, his mother feeding him mush from a jar.

“I don’t believe this,” Sam said, running a hand through his hair. “We actually have a magic camera!”

“I know, right?” Roger asked with a grin as he snapped a picture of the living room.

“This is unbelievable. God I have so many questions! Who used to own that camera? Are there any others like it? How far into the past can it look? How does…”

Sam trailed off when he saw the look on Roger’s face. The smile was gone. He looked at the celluloid square in his trembling hands with wide eyes, the color draining from his face.

“Dude? What’s wrong?”

Roger’s mother had been gone for four years now, since he was ten. Just up and vanished without a trace while Roger was at school and his dad was at work. Left her wallet, car and everything. They’d reached out to family and friends, but no one had seen a trace of her. Vanished into thin air.

But the photograph clearly showed Roger’s mother lying facedown on the living room floor, his father standing over her, blood dripping from the knife he held tightly.";16176601970
A Real-Life Disney Princess;1892;63;"My sister Meghan’s always been obsessed with Disney princesses.

Every Halloween she dressed up as a different Disney princess. For Christmas, she asked for limited edition Disney princess dolls. Once, she even asked our parents to legally change her name to Aurora.

Her fascination continued long after we were all grown up. Any time Meghan and I got together she’d insist on going to see some Disney remake or musical together, and no family gathering was complete without her off-key rendition of a classic Disney tune.

It was annoying at times, but we all accepted it as just a harmless quirk. We never expected anything dangerous to come of it. Nothing like what happened with our sister-in-law.

Our brother Eric’s fiancée, Elsa, was stunning. Originally from Sweden, she was the stereotypical blonde, blue-eyed Scandinavian beauty with creamy skin and a tall, willowy figure.

As Eric explained to us, Elsa is a fairly common name in that part of the world. It wasn’t a huge coincidence that she had the same name as the *Frozen* character.

But Meghan quickly became obsessed with her. Any time Eric brought Elsa over for family events, Meghan would stare and stare at her, making everyone uncomfortable, poor Elsa most of all. And she wouldn’t stop gushing about Elsa to anyone who’d listen; about her pretty dresses, her elegant mannerisms, and her regal demeanor.

“Like a real-life Disney princess,” she breathed. 

Meghan wasn’t invited to the wedding. It wasn’t a personal slight – at least, Eric swore it wasn’t – they just ran into last-minute logistical issues and ended up having a downsized wedding in Sweden, where most of us couldn’t make it anyway.

But I could tell Meghan was really, really upset. She unfriended Elsa on Facebook, which, for her, was a big deal as she loved to keep tabs on our entire extended family.

The two of them didn’t meet again until months after the wedding, at our parents’ annual Christmas party. Surprisingly, everything seemed fine. Meghan greeted Elsa warmly and soon enough they started chatting like real sisters. The booze flowed freely, stories were swapped, and everyone was having a good time. 

As the guests started to leave, Eric started asking if anyone had seen his wife. No one had, not for a while, and several of us started looking for her together.

Meghan didn’t get involved in the search. I figured it was just because she felt awkward about the previous drama between her and Elsa. But as we passed by her, she made an odd remark. “The cold never bothered her anyway,” she said, and laughed.

We didn’t know what that meant, not until a guest opened our parents’ extra-large freezer in the basement and discovered Elsa’s frozen corpse.

She was bound and gagged. The gag had slipped loose and she’d died screaming. Unfortunately, no one had heard her over the sound of Meghan’s shrill rendition of ‘Let It Go.’";16176248570
Between the Drywall;47;4;"A possible murder?

Unrelenting spirits?

A body never found?

These are all things I can live with.

But nobody said there would be spiders.

This house was an absolute steal due to the stories that surrounded it and its earlier tenants, but as of now those are just that. Stories.

However, the 8-legged monstrosity sitting in the corner of my room, that was real. And for me, that was a big, big problem. A problem that could be solved with a big, long broom.

Holding my weapon at arm’s length I thrust it into the corner. A direct hit.

I watched in disgust as I peeled back the broom, revealing a patch of goo and legs stuck to the wall.

At least the spider was gone.

After reluctantly cleaning off the spot it was time to hit the hay. That near death experience on top of work had drained me.

I went through the house again checking for any more spiders before turning off all the lights. I eventually made it back to my room and after turning off my computer the whole house was at last dark, silent and spider free.

With my new found solace I went to sleep.

I was woken later that night by quiet, muffled chittering and tapping behind my head, a sound that so far I had never heard before.

Great, now there were mice in my walls.

Despite the noise being quiet I could hear that it seemed to be only following one direction, as if it was making a journey back to its nest.

Getting up out of bed I placed my ear to the wall. The chittering was much more defined now and I could easily follow its path out to the main hallway. The sound was getting progressively louder, becoming uncomfortable to listen to up close.

As I backed away from the wall I saw it.

Another spider. 

Startled, I ran back to my room to grab my trusty broom before racing back out to kill it. 

As I prepared for the attack I noticed something strange about this spider. It wasn’t silent like the last few things I had encountered. I was far enough from the wall so that the chattering behind it was quiet, but as the spider scaled the wall there was an audible tap similar to the tap of nails on a hard surface.

Regardless I thrust the broom outwards towards the spider with such ferocity that it went clean through the drywall. 

Pulling the broom back I stared into the darkness and at the pulsating, tapping mass. Amidst the sea of tiny, red eyes 8 marble sized eyes stared back.

With this new hole in the wall the sound of tapping nails, and all the creatures making it, could escape.

He then explained that they were strange-looking people who live in the sky that have been visiting him in bed for the last 3 nights. I tried to brush it off as a child's imagination, but I still felt uneasy. That night, I decided to sit outside his room. I also told him to yell for me if they come back.

Hours passed, nothing. My eyelids grew heavier. Right as I was about to shut them, I was jolted back into awareness by a loud noise. It sounded as if an aircraft was going to land right on my head! It was accompanied by a bright light shining from below my son's door. ""Dad! They're here! The Sky People! I can see them!"" my son screamed. How haven't I known about this before?

I almost kicked the door down. My parental instincts let me know my son was in serious danger. I stormed into his room. I froze right where I was when I saw what was the the room with him. Six huge figures surrounded his bed (it was too dark to see too many details at the moment).

My son laid there, staring wide-eyed at the figures. I lunged towards him, but one of the figures put his hand out in my direction. He didn't even touch me, but I immediately dropped to the ground like a rag doll.

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't move. I was now scared for both me and my son's lives. Three of the figures stood over me. They were Aliens! 

I knew they had to be! I've never seen creatures so horrible and otherworldly-looking. One of them spoke in the most demented voice I've ever heard. ""Perfect adult male specimen. He's coming with us.""

A few hours later, I woke up in a bubbling green liquid. Once my eyes adjusted, I realized I was in a jar. Most horrifying, I was nothing but a severed head! I could think, but I couldn't do anything but move my mouth and eyes. The base of my neck was sore. Probably hooked up to many wires and tubes.

My eyes adjusted more, I could see the aliens staring at me from outside. I was in some type of Lab. I could see my son's head in his own jar of the opposite side of the room. Infuriatingly, there was nothing I could do. I didn't even know where the rest of my body was!

The aliens spoke again. ""Such a bizarre creature."" ""I've never seen anything on Earth like it!"" ""Why is it so human-looking?""";16177050740
Earthquake;58;4;"Thick layers of dust covered everything. From the windows to the floors, he had to wash every dish before using them to avoid the stale taste it carried. The cabin had lost the battle to the elements after years of neglect. Ronnie stood at the window, eyes fixed on the surrounding area. 
“Can you hear me Ronnie? Over” Crackle. 

Ronnie pushed down on the button, “Yeah, is this gonna be bad?” Ronnie asked. He stared at the Desert landscape and pressed the button once again, “Over.” The glass on the old wooden table started to Tremble slightly, sending waves throughout Ronnie’s Jack and coke.

“What are you doing out there Ronnie? Over.” Crackle. 

Ronnie smiled, “It’s my uncle’s cabin. I thought it was a good place to hold up...Over” Ronnie said. 

“You by yourself? Over.” Crackle.

“Yeah. I’ve never been in an earthquake before. Over,” Ronnie said.

“Well Ronnie I’m not gonna lie, this is a shitshow. Over,” Crackle. 

Ronnie laughed, “Like a funny story over drinks type shitshow or the call My next Of kin kind? Over,” Ronnie said. 

“Ronnie, do you feel the floor trembling? Over” Crackle.

“Yeah, Over.” Ronnie said.

“Well in 20 minutes that tremble is gonna turn into a rumble. Over.” Crackle.

Ronnie smiled, “So, I hide under the table or something. That what they used to do in the movies...Over.” Ronnie said.

“Ronnie, this ain’t no fucking earthquake!” Crackle. Ronnie could see more dark figures forming within the dust cloud. Their feet creating a stampede along the Desert ground. “Do you read? Over,” they were clawing at the air as they raced toward the cabin. A storm of death and destruction was moments away from raining down on the only thing Ronnie had left in this world. “Ronnie! Over.” Crackle.

“Can we pretend? Over,” Ronnie said.

“Repeat? Over” Crackle.

“For just a little while, can we pretend? Over.” Ronnie said. It was a moment before the radio came back to life, the horde of zombies were only a few miles out now.

“Yeah Ronnie, we can pretend. Over.” The radio crackled for the last time.";16176860670
Creative Liars;23;5;"I'll stick to the facts. I might not have long. 


Today I responded to a job advertisement looking for ""Creative Liars."" I texted a number and received some basic info. I could work from home. I started late at night, which seemed strange, but I need the money.


I was sent a link to download an app. My employer texted to say they'd be monitoring me, including any calls and texts I make. I almost backed out. But the money… 


I immediately connected with my first anonymous client. The client asked me my name. I made one up. The client asked me my age. I lied again.


The only real instructions I was given beforehand were to ""think big. The greater the lie, the greater the clients' experience."" I was told of a bonus, which would cover my rent for a month, if I made things ""memorable.""


My first client started asking me some really random stuff that I couldn't possibly know, like questions about their grandma. I just replied ""Don't know."" The client left the chat, if you can call this sick ""game"" a chat.


My employer sent me a text telling me to improve, or I'd be gotten rid of. Rude jerks, I thought.


My second clients used a lot of curse-words. Teenage idiots, I figured. I told them I'd track them down, one-by-one. I could tell that there were several of them. More curse-words came my way, and several sexual suggestions. I got pissed, and threatened to ""f**k"" them up.


The clients didn't reply for a while, and then they doubled down on the inappropriate language and scenarios. So I touched a panic button at the bottom of my cellphone screen. The conversation ended. 


Another text arrived from my employer, telling me to use the panic button more sparingly, or I'd ""not be spared."" I really wasn't appreciating this sinister insinuation shit. 


A link then appeared on my cellphone screen, to a livestream on some dumb kid's YouTube account. There were lots of screams, and sobs. It seemed pretty cheesy; a set-up. Lights flickering, doors opening. Stuff flying around. One kid was playing dead, a carving knife in his chest.


Then I heard a crying kid who'd crawled under a bed stutter ""it said it'd f**k us up."" 


My next client contacted me, before I could process anything. ""Hello?"" ""Hello?""  ""Is anyone dead there?""


Another text from my employer: ""Is anyone dead there?"" 


That's when I tried to uninstall the app, and block my employer's number. Neither worked. I dialled 911, but all I heard on the phoneline was that stuttering kid say ""what do you want? Please stop. My friends are dead. Please stop."" Then I heard them gargle, and choke.


My employer texted: ""Do you want to stop?"" And I noticed every sharp object in the room pointing directly towards me.


Another client started dragging the digitised planchette across the backdrop which I can't remove from my cellphone screen. ""Hello? Hello? Hello?""";16176973850
Finding my Brother;43;3;"“Did you think I wouldn’t find you?”

When we were young, my brother and I would play hide and seek. For hours we would take turns hiding about the house and yard. Being the oldest I was almost always the seeker. 

“You hid so well.”

It was a summer morning, when I couldn’t find him. It took me too long to realize he was missing. That moment has been burned into me. Hell, I can still remember the smell of the day, the scent of cigarettes and fresh cut grass.

“It was only a matter of time.”

We searched for months spreading so far into the woods and the county. We didn’t sleep and we didn’t eat. But still years went by. It felt impossible that life could go on.

“You gave us a real scare there.”

I ended up becoming a tow truck driver. I couldn’t bring myself to leave the small town, I never went to college and I never gave up the search. The cops told us they had had a person of interest and even took him to court. It was a man from a couple blocks away. We had never even met him.

“But it’s so good to finally see your face again.”

The trial fell apart in a disaster. The prosecutors evidence was circumstantial at best and at worst almost felt forged. The defense almost even had me believing that he hadn’t done it. It wasn’t until the jury found him not guilty and he passed me in the hall that I knew. He smiled just to me, winked and lit a cigarette.

“And it’s finally just us.”

After the trial I didn’t see him around town again. He was avoiding us. A for sale sign popped up in front of his house.

“I look so different now don’t I?” 

It was a fateful day eleven years into my towing days that my prayers were answered. It came in the form of a simple phone call. There was a car broken down on the side of a country road leading out of town. I always spend a bit of time searching the tree line just to see if anything was off. But not today.

“But finally here we are.”

The drive back to my tow yard was the happiest I have been in over a decade. The followed me into my office and the instant he signed my book I cracked him over the head with a wrench. He didn’t recognize what I have become.

“This is your chance to tell me where my brother is hiding.”

That man struggles in and out of consciousness bound by chains in the center of my garage. He had beaten me up until today. He hid my brother where I couldn’t find him. But he will tell me where to find my brother. Then I will hide this man piece by piece where no one will ever find him.";16176820480
I'm a good boy.;83;9;"Something had been bothering my mom lately. I couldn't tell what was on her mind, but she was just not being herself anymore...

Just the other day, I couldn't be any happier. I spent my day playing with my toys, and when the clock struck eight in the evening, I ran to the front door, arriving just as she stepped inside. She dropped on a knee and hugged me. Her smile was warm and caring, her fingers lovingly brushing my hair. I really couldn't be any happier.

""Hey! What's up, buddy? 'Been a good boy?"" 

""Yes! I had fun! So much fun! I played with my toys again today, mommy! And when I was playing, I heard something at the door! And... And I found out it was the mail, mommy!""

I squeezed out of her hug to pick the mail by her feet, and that was when it started.

She sighed at first, complaining, ""Bills... Oh, look! More bills!... How nice of them."" 

Usually, she also found a reason to smile within that pile of papers, so I found her reaction hilarious, scolding those envelopes along with her. However, her face changed for the worse the further she reached into that pile, and I could no longer laugh.

""Mommy? What's wrong?""

She wouldn't talk anymore, completely focused on the paper in her hands.

""Mommy?.... Mommy... Mo-""

""Be quiet for a second, damn it! Let me think!"" she shouted.

I jumped back. She no longer talked to me that day, and I played by myself. I took it as her having a bad day, and just looked forward to the following day.

To my horror, however, she came home with a scowl and gave me no more than a passing glance. She ignored me and locked herself in her room, raising her voice and crying. I called out to her, but she wouldn't listen. I was ignored once again. I felt... useless... like she didn't want me anymore. I wanted to try harder.

The day after that, we met again by the door, where I made it a point to show just how excited I was to see her.

""Mommy came! Mommy came! Mo-""

The leg she raised as I cheered for her reached my stomach. She also couldn't hold back a chuckle. The worry I heard in her sighs days prior turned into relief... She no longer cried, but from that day, I did... everyday. No matter where I hid, she would find me... sending me on my way to another hiding spot with a painful strike. I learned not to cry, because she enjoyed it. And I learned not not run, because she loved seeking me out.

Today, I'm still hoping... waiting at the door.

And finally, she opens it, slamming it behind her and running by me. Not long after, two men enter as well.

""Hey, buddy. Who's a good boy?"" One smiles.

Like mommy used to call me...

""Where's mommy?""

""I know where mommy is!""";16176681920
Love all dogs;25;5;"I could feel the descent. I scurried around in my rusty cage in a frenzy wanting to taste freedom as bad as ever.

The rattling came to a stop and I could hear metal clank. After a few seconds, someone ripped the strap off my eyes. As the dust cleared I could see that my cage had landed and the door was open. I crawled out. My paws hurt, but freedom was sweeter. 

I sniffed around like all inquisitive labradors do, finding nothing but dust and poop. I knew of the parvo so I steered clear of alien poop. Why did the master put me in this dead wasteland, I wondered. Seems like my natural habitat but well, nothing beats plush living, eh?

I began my journey to the hills I could spot down yonder. Bowls of water and kibble were nailed to the ground periodically, in old steel bowls. It wasn't pedigree, but a beggar doesn't get to choose, does he?

I finally made it to the hills. I got a nice little nap near the base and made my way to the top. 

I was panting but I wanted to know what lay beyond. As I neared the top, I could hear violent caterwauling. Oh, the ever infamous whining and that damned stench that my master absolutely hated. 

I tiptoed over to the edge to get a good look at the situation.

I finally saw it. 

Goldens, pugs, pitbulls, Dobermans, poodles, you name it. 

A bombastic canine orgy. I had never seen anything like it. No one could get enough. Not even the Chow chows. 

Master hadn't neutered me. Neither did he make me mate. I trudged downhill towards the canine fuck fest. I wanted a piece. I couldn't stand any longer. This is what I was meant for.

30 feet above, a drone lay afloat, sending robotic audio messages to the other side.

They play god;26;5;An empty space, wreaked with havoc and blood. One man stood over this pit of machines and wires which once held this beast. They wanted to be powerful, to make themselves feared. Fear is still present, just directed towards it instead. It started in February, or march, the months mean nothing now. They found themselves in a cave, thirsty and hungry. They were on hands and knees eyeing each other, thinking who has the most meat. They then found it, a heavenly deer. It was rotten and dead, but still a gift. They saw this as the cave giving them help and new meaning to life. They built, and built. Machines with wires everywhere, gears turning, and metal scraping. It became less and less about science and more like a cult. People were often thrown in for… unknown reasons, other than insanity. They let their power feed them to the point of no return. When it rose, deer-like and made of human flesh mixed with gears and wire. They bowed to it, it ripped them to shreds in return. For months that thing ripped through the middle east, leaving nothing in its wake. The man wondered if this was the best option, as he flung himself into the pit, miles deep, he knew it was better than letting that creature get to him first. They should have left playing god, to god.;16176759420
Sleep;130;9;"I slowly ground the sleeping pills into a fine powder before adding it to the soup. I kept stirring until the powder had completely disappeared out of sight, before ladling the food into bowls and placing them on the table.

I yelled out that dinner was ready and couldn't help but smile as my 4 year old twins ran in and sat down at the table. They quickly devoured the meagre meal that I had prepared for them. After they finished their food, they both kissed me on the cheek before heading upstairs to play.

I found them passed out on the floor of their bedroom two hours later and carried them over to their beds. I wept uncontrollably as I held the pillows over their faces until they were finally dead.

I gazed out the window to see my wife clawing at the timber that we had placed on the outside of the windows to keep the undead out. She still looked beautiful no matter how decayed her face had gotten. 

The rhythmic tapping of the rain on the roof and the occasional groan from a zombie were the only sounds to be heard, as I sat on the chair with the shotgun propped under my chin.

I gazed down at the bite mark on my arm and knew that I had maybe an hour or so before I turned. I felt guilt at having murdered my daughters but knew they wouldn't have survived without me.";16176441520
My Friends;67;4;"It started when I was eight years old.

The first one followed me home from school one day. I told my mom, but she said he wasn’t there, and that I should stop making things up to scare her.

He wouldn’t go away. So I got used to him. Sometimes he sang, and sometimes he was silent. But he was always there.

A year later, another one came. Again, I tried to tell my mom, but she refused to listen. When I insisted, she brought me to the doctors. They gave me pills and put me into therapy, and when that didn’t work, I was sent to a psychiatrist hospital.

It got worse. A new visitor would come every few months. I started calling them my “friends” and giving them names. The first one was Tom, the second was Maria, and so on. I hated the fact that they wouldn’t leave me alone, and I hated their stupid singing.

After two years, I was released from the hospital. They said I had been cured. I didn’t tell them that Tom and Maria and others were still there; I had just learned to pretend they weren’t.

...

It’s been a few years since the last one showed up. I live a mostly normal life now. I go to work 5 days a week; I buy groceries once a week; I go on a date once in a while. But my friends are always there, and even when they are silent I hear their humming voices in the back of my mind.

...

I am making dinner in my kitchen and Tom is whistling loudly behind me. I tell him to stop, but he doesn’t. He never listens. And when the pasta water in the pot boils over, suddenly my anger boils over too.

“Shut the fuck up!” I yell, grabbing a knife and spinning around. I stab it at Tom, and to my surprise, he vanishes. He’s just… completely gone.

Elated at this discovery, I run around my apartment like the lunatic that I know I am, slashing at my old friends. As they disappear, I feel only relief. The sweet sound of silence fills my ears. Finally, I am alone.

They are back the next morning. But it’s not a problem for long. I repeat the slashing and stabbing affair of the previous night, and the rest of my day is wonderful. This goes on every day for a few months. I haven’t felt at peace like this since I was eight years old.

...

One day I hear a knock at the door. I open it. It’s another one. A new friend. Without hesitation I reach for the knife. But this time I feel soft flesh. And there is blood. So much blood.";16176362580
If you have Ghosts;1820;108;"“The house has ghosts,” the realtor told us. “By that I mean, it has personality.”

It was a beautiful victorian house, restored to its former glory by the best craftsmen in the business, quote the realtor. But why is it so cheap then? I asked.

Buyers market, the realtor shrugged.

We bought it of course. It was everything we’d ever wanted in a house. Vast, lofty rooms, in a gorgeous countryside setting. And so much history. If you open your heart, my wife said, you can still feel them. Lords and ladies, lads and lassies, young and old, secrets and promises. Lost to the physical realm, but still here in a sense, their lives etched in the fading wood. 

And she believed it too. That spirits roamed the old hallways, and that every creak and bang in the autumn storms was a spectre or a ghast, revenants or phantasms, but that they meant us no harm. 

“If you have ghosts,” she’d say. “You have everything.”

When I fell ill, my parents told me I should move. This place isn’t good for you, they said, dread-filled eyes darting all over the place. But we couldn’t. This was our home, and if need be, I’d die in it.

I was out of it for months, barely hanging on by a thread. In and out of consciousness, fever dreams and hallucinations. I could see them then, the true inhabitants of the house. Dead expressions on cold faces, gaunt and harrowing. I’d scream for hours, but my wife would always be there to ease my suffering.

And then came the night of the intruders.

I was so weak, barely strong enough to roll out of bed on the best of days. The bang was loud, too loud, and followed almost instantly by broken glass hitting the hardwood floors.

Within seconds they stood above my bed. My vision was blurry, and for a moment I was sure it was them; the haunters in the dark, the pale wanderers. But then I saw the masks. And then they spoke. 

“We should restrain him,” one of them said.

“Fuck that,” another voice snarled. “Let’s put a fucking bullet in him.”

A gentle nod then, and slowly one of the intruders brought the gun to my temple. Finger on the trigger, I closed my eyes.

And then came the screams. Bestial, violent, blood-curdling. Other sounds too. Sounds you’re never supposed to hear. Limbs torn off bodies, heads ripped in half, guts and blood spilled onto expensive carpets in flood-like waves.

“Are you alright, my love?” my wife whispers into my ear. She seems so distant now. So far away. Like when I lowered her into the ground. Like when I wept for days and weeks.

“Thank you,” I say. “I love you.”

I turn around sleepily, the scent of her fading like a fleeting dream. But I know she’s there. She will always be there when I need her.

*If you have ghosts*, she whispers, *you have everything*.";16175702830
My New Typewriter;89;5;"I saw it in the front window of an antiques shop and there was no way I could refuse purchasing it there and then.

I grew so attached to the thing; I would use it to type up stories, and letters, and poems. Anything to hear the wonderful sounds that it made. After work I would come home with new ideas and go to my office to use my beloved typewriter. Through its years it had seen much use - the tattered paint on one side...the slightly faded 'P' and 'S' keys. But that was the charm of it, it was imperfect.

""Why don't you take yourself away from that thing?"" my wife would say.

""I shall, I promise. Just give me a few more minutes.""

Those minutes turned into hours, of course. And I knew that she had a point, I was spending far too much time away from her. I was very hurt one day when I saw that she had destroyed a story I had written one long evening and left the pieces on the desk for me to see.

If only she was able to understand the pleasure it gave me.

Such pleasure.

Such pleasure I feel now, as I rest my hands on its keys, occasionally lifting my eyes to the office window, where I can see out onto the lawn. And I'm so at ease with my dear typewriter that the sounds are embedded in my soul, they are there but I have to focus to hear them. I examine my work proudly, then I start up and go to the window.

*Why don't you take yourself away from that thing?*

A tear found my cheek.

If only I hadn't been so emotional.

Then my typewriter started typing on its own. I turned to look at it and the keys started moving faster and faster and faster.

*T-tap, t-tap, t-tap, t-tap...*

I walked over.

*Slide*.

I started to frown.

*T-tap, t-tap, t-t-t-t...tap*

I looked at the page.

*Slide*.

Heartbreak Hill;29;3;"Dear Diary,

I was so excited this morning when Becky, the most popular girl in the whole school invited me to hang out with her after class. She’s been my crush ever since freshman year and I’ve never worked up the courage to talk to her. I almost did a few times, but it felt like there was an invisible force field between us. To this day I don’t know if it was intuition or just my social anxiety. I've seen a lot of other guys with her lately, I'm surprised she's giving me a chance. Graduation is almost here so most of the guys haven't been showing up to class, less competition for me. As soon as the bell rang, Becky grabbed my hand and smiled as we rushed out of class. “Wowzers she must really like me,” I thought to myself. My heart rate sped up like the drums in a rock chorus.

We grabbed burgers and ate them on the hill behind our school. It had these beautiful roses sprouting up from the ground and the grass softly scratched your back as you laid on it. It's school tradition for seniors to make ""promposals"" here so I was thinking about asking her out.

The anxious butterflies bouncing in my belly transformed into rampaging bats, seemingly fighting each other to the death as I mustered up the strength to go for it. ""Hey, uhmmm... I was thinking maybe we c-""

""Organic matter makes a splendid fertilizer for these roses you know."" She interrupted.

""Hah yeah... totally"" Why would someone so smart date someone like me?

""Especially human matter""

Ugghhh... why is it always like this, guys like me never get the girl.

She turned to face me and leaned in slowly.

Maybe I should just give up at this point

""I want to be inside you."" Becky grinned

""What?!""

I felt a sharp pain in my chest, everything went dark as she painted the roses a darker red.";16176029930
Dance for Me;77;6;"The curtain opens and bright overhead lights flood the stage.

I have never been so afraid but my body begins to move regardless.

My arm raises above my head as I raise to my toes in my ballerina slippers and with a twirl I am off. I pirouette and step weightlessly across the stage to the tune of a piano. With graceful leaps, tears stream down my face. 

My vision is blurred but I am forced to continue not knowing if it would be better for a crowd to see me like this or not.

The tempo slows and lights become a deep blue. I take slow steps in rhythm across the stage. My head turns over my shoulder as if looking for someone and my steps stop. The music falls silent. 

I want to scream but I can’t.

The music rushes back in a blare and my body moves with it. The lights have changed to red matching my body’s frantic movements. 

I jolt as I jump an impossible distance, leap after leap from one side to the other looking about, while my arms shake and jolt searching desperately for a way to escape.

The piano’s music devolves into a single key struck so fast but slowing. 

As I back into the center of the stage arms held fully extended to each side as if trying to hold back invisible forces.

I raise to my toes head facing the lights above as the song reaches its conclusion.

My feet raise from the ground.

I find myself suspended feet above the stage for what feels like an eternity before recorded applause starts the curtain crashes closed.

In the dark my body collapses in a heap as the steel wires they fixed to my limbs go limp. 

Blood drips from the incisions. I want to reach for the wires that stitch my mouth shut but my hands won’t move. 

All I can do is wait. How long will they force me to dance?";16175793250
Ghosts and Regrets;654;20;"I sit in darkness, on the floor just off the entryway. The grandfather clock says it’s 11:09. It’ll happen soon, just like last year, like every year.

Thunder rumbles. Through the unshuttered windows, the sky is clear. A full moon shines like a spotlight into the spacious foyer.

11:10. I look to the door on the opposite side of the hall. Anxiety swells in my chest.

The door opens of its own accord. The sound of footsteps and scraping echo against the vaulted ceiling. I can’t see anything, but I don’t need to—I know who’s there. I know what she’s doing.

I stand up.

“Mom!” I yell. “What are you doing? It’s eleven at night—that can wait until tomorrow!”

A voice mumbles, but it’s not directed at me. I know the litany well: “No one does anything around here . . . I’m the only one who cares . . . this place would go to pieces without me . . . .”

“Mom! It isn’t safe!”

The scraping stops, and now I can see the shape of the rickety ladder. After twenty years, it’s rotted in some places, shuddering on its uneven feet.

“Mom, please!” Tears stream down my face. “I said I’d help you in the morning! Please, just wait? Why won’t you wait?”

The ladder rocks as an invisible force begins to climb. The sound of rain against glass swells as a silhouette reaches the top. 

“Mom!” I scream. I’m tempted to run into the foyer, an audience member invading the stage. But I know better. I’ve tried it before. “Mom, *please,* you’re going to get yourself killed!”

She doesn’t listen. She never listens. Or maybe she can’t hear.

It doesn’t matter which.

The figure reaches toward the chandelier and mimics unscrewing a lightbulb. There’s nothing there to grasp—the light hasn’t been replaced since it happened.

At the apex of her reach, when the ladder wobbles under her, the thunder booms. The windows rattle, the walls shake, the sound resounds inside my chest.

My mother jerks in surprise. The ladder rocks.

I don’t see the fall. Tears blur everything into shadows and silver. But I hear the impact.

I sink to my knees, grief tearing through my throat, spasming through my body. When I can’t shed another tear, I collapse onto the floor and wait.

Eventually, the light changes. Gold diffuses the silver. Outside, birds trill. Still exhausted, I rise. I wish I could sleep, but I can’t. I haven’t for a long time.

Instead, I walk. Dust lays thick on the carpet, but I leave no footprints. I know every inch of this place. Every goddamn inch.

I want to leave. I don’t enjoy this pantomime. The guilt tethers me here, cursed to relive my greatest regret over and over. Trapped in a parallel purgatory. If I just let go of the guilt, I’ll be free. Or maybe . . .

. . . things will be different next year.";16175281350
Something Fishy;43;2;"The beach was packed. 

Waves had pushed the shipwreck down the coast. It was an old ship, so worn down that bystanders declared it a pirate's ship. Coast guard members guarded the ship from the public.

The media was having a field day.

""Sources are claiming this mysterious ship wreckage to be the ship of pirates, and may even store treasure inside,"" one reporter declared.

Minutes after the rumor had been broadcast live, hell broke loose. Officials brought out weapons to contain everything. The ship was fascinating. You couldn't see inside of it; it was mostly intact. It was simple, so... mysterious. Would this wreck tell us about the past? Was there actually treasure inside? And for the love of god, what was that putrid smell wafting out of it?

People suspected rotting fish inside, but nobody knew. Guards were warned not to step near it.

When the helicopter of scientists in hazmat suits arrived, people cheered. They quickly got to work. Finally, it was time to explore inside.

The lead archaeologist opened the trapdoor. He hopped down with ease. Everyone held their breath.

Then, the bubble was burst. A bloodcurdling scream. Others on board rushed over, but the smell had gotten so bad that they took one whiff and heaved. 

Another moan. A giant gag. ...A series of bangs, followed by a thick silence. The others had filled up their hazmat suits with so much vomit that some were choking, desperately trying to crawl away.

The crowd was evacuated. Medics were called, told to bring the heaviest gear imaginable. 

Someone on the crew decided that the mystery must be solved. A rope and camera were tied around his waste. After recording a message for his daughter, he quickly descended below. 

It was hard to hear anything besides his breathing. And then... the camera focused.

Oh god.

The corpses. The gray bodies in old clothing, hanging from ropes. Almost fully decomposed. The man gagged before slowly approaching a chest in the corner. 

Treasure?

A scroll. There were words on it, but the camera couldn't pick up on them. 

As the man read, he let out the sickest, most twisted scream that anyone's ever heard.

He turned, to see a fresh limp body swinging from the rotting beam, their eyes bulging. The archaeologist. 

""Sam!"" A few people shouted, horrified. Sam groaned and wailed, his legs buckling. ""We're pulling you up!"" someone screamed.

Everyone cried as Sam was pulled on deck. Someone untied the rope from around him as everyone else rushed to listen.

""You don't want to know,"" Sam choked. ""You don't want to know what they found out there. In the ocean. Oh god."" 

""What?"" 

""Leave now. Don't explore the ocean. They were right. Get the hell out of this world.""

And with one final sob, Sam jumped and sprinted into the sea. He forced himself under the waves, until his still body bobbed with the current. The crew stared.

""Think we should read it?"" someone finally gulped.";16175799530
Not safe.;14;2;"Her head ached and her eyes were having a tough time adjusting to the lack of light. 

She tasted pennies and moved to touch her lips then realizing that her hands and feet were tightly bound. 
Frightened and confused her mind montaged all the possible culprits.

*who wants to hurt me?* 

*did I anger someone?*

She wriggled around in her surroundings. Her knees and forehead bumping into what seemed like metal bars.

It was a cage.";16175972540
Nails;20;3;" Cold. The floor is too cold. He wakes up, trying to lift himself off it. There is no hope.

The end has begun.

He is unable to rise. 

Shifting around, He feels the sting of a million pierces all along his left side. There is no light accompanying the rich raw smell, distinctive of sea water. His smirk would have amplified even a glimmer of light. 

He gently rocks with the rest of the vessel as they move forth over the waves.

He is tired. Yet he must rise. For aeons he had waited for this moment. He could not waste it all by simply lying down. 

He shifts his weight to his right side. He ignores all the pain as he gets to his feet. A gasp escapes his lips. 

It is time.

The darkness around him is inky, but he seems to know his way. He takes three steps from where he stands. The pain that his supple feet feel now is nothing compared to the pleasure that he will much soon revel in, he knows. 

Now, he reaches out into the darkness. 

A few minutes go by. He changes into the clothes he found. The tide seemed to aide him. The sea was calm as he slipped into the familiar doublet and the overcoat. His feet welcome the shoes. Now, they would be distracted no more by the little pains. 

Now, he can focus. 

He remembers that there is a mirror right next to the wardrobe. He stands in front of it. He cannot see, but he traces the burn on the side of his face with the index finger of his left hand. He ruffles his hair up with the right, feeling the little bald spot that the acid had gifted him. 

Oh, how he wished he could see her blonde hair. He should have thanked her, before he stabbed her. He should have thanked her before he choked the life force out of her, breathing it in. She had looked at him lovingly one last time, before turning to ash.

He will thank her soon, standing over the ashes of that ash tree.

He climbs the nine steps. He takes his time on each and stops before the door. He reaches out with his right hand and picks up the green bowler cap from the hatstand. 

Dusting it, he grips the door handle. Blood drips.

One last sacrifice.

He walks out, greeted by the dusky sky. The smell of the water is much sharper. With each muffled step he takes towards the helm of the vessel, the deck grows quieter. The shadowy figures get out of his way, out of veneration and trepidation. 

His green robe shines maliciously in the sunlight as he places his hand on the captain’s wheel. He places his dark cap on a hook next to it. 

It is time.

It begins.

He grins.

Loke stands on the Naglafar, the nail-ship. Ragnarök begins now.";16175886120
The Final Secret;23;7;"The old man lay on his deathbed; he knew the end was soon. The hospice nurse had last visited just over an hour ago. His neighbors did their best to look out for him; just yesterday, they had cleared the weeds from his front yard. Given the circumstances, he felt lucky. A lot of people's lives had changed for the worse when the nation's currency suddenly collapsed; the government claimed their new ""emergency powers"" were all that held back utter chaos. The old man wasn't convinced; after all, he still owned his own home, and his neighborhood was still a decent place to live.

On the other hand, that home was presently being ransacked by government agents. They had announced their presence loudly as they broke down his front door, and had started searching before bothering to talk to him. The senior agent finally entered the old man's bedroom. He chuckled at the sight; dark suit, sunglasses, earpiece -- he looked straight out of G-man central casting, almost a parody. If the intent was to look intimidating, he had completely failed, as far as the old man was concerned.

The agent proffered a packet of stapled-together pages. ""This warrant authorizes us to search your personal effects for any and all evidence of criminal behavior--""

The old man interrupted him. ""What was your probable cause? I don't make any trouble.""

The agent huffed. ""Your years-long efforts to protect your privacy; we consider it an admission that you have something to hide. There's also your history of having an 'independent spirit'.""

""Are you *serious*?"" the old man snorted. ""You have *no* evidence I've done anything wrong...you can't point to *any* complaints...and yet you think you can do *this* to me? You're a disgrace to the Constitution.""

""You know *fully* well that's been suspended,"" the agent retorted. ""Times are too dangerous.""

""The only dangers I see are the ones *caused* by the government,"" the old man snapped. ""This totalitarian police-state was *very* expensive to build. You spent yourselves into the ground, and finally collapsed our currency. Life savings vanished overnight."" His heart erupted with shooting pains; he knew he only had seconds left.

""People like *you* have to answer for that!"" the agent shot back. ""We've used *every* means at our disposal, for *years*, to figure out what you do and what you believe; this search warrant is our last-ditch attempt.""

""Oh, *really*?"" mocked the old man. ""You want to know what I've done? Come closer."" The agent uncertainly shuffled towards him. ""Closer."" Nervously, he leaned in. ""No, closer."" The agent's head was now inches away. The old man hoped his dying stench was offensive.

""Nothing! I *detest* this absolute despotism you make me live in! But I knew I couldn't fight you...so I did the only thing I could. I tried to bankrupt you."" The agent's jaw dropped as an underling entered to announce they'd found nothing incriminating.

The old man smiled, gasping his last words. ""And there are millions more like me.""";16175851440
Digging was the only way;19;0;"The rumble from the earthquake flings me back out of my recliner and onto the ground. I have never felt a force so intense. My seven-year-old son, Eli, who was playing in a sandbox in the backyard, opens the sliding glass door and walks towards me in the living room, no emotion on his face. He seems rattled. 

“You okay buddy? Just a little quake, nothing to be afraid of. They happen sometimes.”

Eli doesn’t respond. He stares at me for a few minutes.

“You must be really shaken up.”

I try to comfort him by hugging him, but he does not wrap his arms around me.

“I have an idea. We can dig up some of my old comics. That might cheer you up.”

Eli follows me to the basement where I start going through bins of junk. After tearing away the clutter, I come across a stack of comics. I hand one to Eli. He still hasn’t said a word. Eli takes the comic and heads up to his room. Eli does not speak to me during dinner. His hollow expression worries me. After tucking him into bed, I call it a night myself.

During the middle of the night, a noise from the backyard wakes me up. I peek out the blinds, but it is pitch-black outside. I flip the back porch light on. And there I notice Eli on the grass, shoveling away. I run up to him.

“Why are you digging a hole? It’s past your bedtime. Come back inside.”

Eli keeps digging, which is odd, because I have never seen him hold a shovel in his life. I learn towards the hole. It’s rather impressive how much dirt he has removed. With the next scoop of dirt, the shovel connects with something solid, and a clanking noise rings through my ears. Eli drops the shovel and turns to me.

“I dig,” he says as he extends his left arm in the air, as if he wants to give me a high five. 

I bend down to meet him at eye-level when he suddenly grips the top of my head with his hand and squeezes tight. A static surge rips through me and sends me flying back twenty feet. 

Eli jumps into the hole. A metallic hatch flips open into view. I run towards the hole and look down at Eli, who is sitting in an oval spacecraft-like pod. His face morphs into a pale, white shape with no human features. The engine roars, as the ship levitates above the ground, and catapults towards the stars.

The engine thrusters light up the hole and something catches my eye. It looks like a body. I jump in to investigate. It is Eli, at least what remains of him. His body must have been completely obliterated by the impact of the ship crashing into our yard. And now I will be digging a hole to bury my son.";16175841070
And miles to go before I sleep;2419;219;"You’re not supposed to get into a strangers car. Not in this day and age. Not in any day and age, really. But I have places to be, people to see. It’s like that Robert Frost poem, you know? *The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep.*

My wife, Ellie, Eleanor, is pregnant. Any day now, the docs say. Any day now, and I’ll be a father. Stuff like that puts things into perspective, you know. Changes how you view the world. Changes how far you are willing to go. So I got into the car with the stranger. Couldn’t wait any longer. Promises to keep.

The woods are lovely, no doubt about that though. Dark and deep too. I walked maybe five miles from my piece-of-shit car, before the stranger pulled over. In that time I met them, many of them, beings of the deep and the dark, lost wanderers and souls, pale faces and muttering voices creeping through the dusk.

But I didn’t fear them.

Haunted backroads or not, I had places to be, and I told them as much. I have to get home, I said. Home to my wife and my soon-to-be family. A particularly gaunt figure wouldn’t leave me be, though. Followed me for miles, his harrowing shape always in the periphery. Gentle whispers in my ear; *stay with us*, *come with us*, *you belong with us*. But I persevered. For Ellie. For my boy.

I could feel his breath on my neck when the stranger pulled over. Cold as ice, emotionless, hollow, violently lonely. I knew then that if the car hadn’t pulled over, if the stranger hadn’t stopped, that I would be with them now, the lost ones, forever shackled to this road, to the depths of the forest. Alone and afraid.

“Thank you sir,” I said, climbing into the backseat. “I’m in quite a rush.”

The stranger reminded me of my father. A little bit older maybe, in his fifties or sixties - calm, gentle exterior. I told him about my wife and my current predicament, but he never spoke a word. Just nodded silently, eyes shifting back and forth between the road and the rearview mirror.  


*The woods are lovely, dark and deep*, I muttered to myself.

When he pulled over, my mind was already starting to slip; a heavy mist descending on an already worn and weary soul. He turned around slowly, tears streaming down his face. He seemed so familiar then. Like a far-away memory of something that never happened.

“You can rest now, dad,” the stranger said. “You’ve kept your promise. You found me.”

*I have promises to keep.*

“It wasn’t your fault,” he continued. “The brakes, um, the brakes just failed. It happens. Just one of those things.”

*And miles to go before I sleep.*

“Please dad, you have to move on. You have to rest.”

*And miles to go before I sleep.*";16174835480
Mommy;17;3;"Rachel was drinking heavily. Bottles of alcohol stacked on the table. ""It was just a clump of cells"" she said to herself as she opened another bottle. ""At least, that's what the clinic said"". 

She felt a gust of freezing air come upon her. She saw that one of the windows had been left open. She approached the window to close it but looking out something caught her eye. 

It was a figure. It stood still outside her house.

Rachel closed and locked the window before grabbing her phone to call 911. 

After a period of silence she heard a voice.

*mommyyyy*

She hung up immediately. 

Then a wall shattered.

It was 7 feet tall. So tall it had to crouch through the door frame. It had no discernable eyes or nose. The only thing resembling a ""face"" it had was an empty mouth that hung open. Umbilical cords covered it's body and failed like tentacles. It's organs and skeleton were visible, with no skin or flesh to conceal it. 

Rachel predictably ran. The thing limped after her. Despite its limp it was moving faster. She backed up at the end of the hallway. There was no point in running. She was cornered. 

After a week of no word from her Rachel's mother called the police on a welfare check. 

They found Rachel's corpse with her guts torn open. It was like something tried to crawl inside her. 

A bloody tail of footprints led out the door into the woods. After reporting what they saw they went off to follow the trail.

When I see a picture of a healthy person;3;0;"
When i see a picture of a healthy person it gives me the will and energy to do wonderful things. I don't know why i am like this but it has always been the way i am. Seeing a picture of a healthy person it invigorates me and gives me the morale to do amazing and even nearly impossible things. Healthy people is what life is all about and being able to be healthy is even better. When i get encouraged to do something i do it all the way and when i look back at it, I amaze myself in disbelief that I had done such a wonderful thing.

When I saw a picture of a healthy woman it gave me the strength and will power to build a house for her from ground upwards. Building a house is no easy feat but when i saw the picture of this healthy woman all of a sudden I wanted to build her a house and I just kept on building, until the house was complete. Then when I saw her for what she is today a sickly old woman who was dying in her death bed, I don't know why but I felt betrayed. So made sure to destroy the house with multiple healthy women inside the house as i was destroying it.

Then when I saw a picture of a healthy boy it gave me the energy to get up from bed and build a wonderful fun park for this healthy boy to play at. Seeing the picture of this healthy boy it reminded me of how much potential and time a child has and their innocence to be able to play around and use their imagination is what propelled me to build this park. Then when I saw that the healthy little boy in the picture is now an alcoholic man dying in hospital, i felt betrayed. So destroyed the park while making sure many little healthy boys were trapped inside the park.

Then when I saw a picture of a healthy man it reminded of the strength and growth a person can have and it gave me the determination to build a garage. This garage will be mainly a man garage full of manly things and when i saw that the healthy man in the picture is now dead, i felt even more betrayed.

Interrupted dreams - A personal experience;8;0;"This is a story that goes back a while. I must have been 20 years old and at the time I was still living with my parents.   
 

I never liked my room, I didn't feel comfortable in it and at night I had terrible nightmares that continued to scare me even after I woke up, making me see figures moving in the dark.  
 

I know that having fear of these things may seem a little crazy but I assure you that those nightmares were so twisted and so realistic that in those moments they made me doubt what was or wasn't real.  
 

After this brief preamble I'll move on to tell you the actual story. To summarize, I was about 20 years old and living with my parents. My mom and dad never got along well, they fought a lot and for basically useless things but I won't tell you about that.  
 

That night my parents had a bigger fight than usual and my dad came to sleep in my room. No problem as usual, things of this kind happened frequently but that night something really disturbing happened.  
 

In the evening I fell asleep almost immediately, entering my strange dream world. Nothing strange was in the air and the night proceeded peacefully. Then, in the dream, I felt myself being grabbed. I didn't get scared, it wasn't unusual as a sensation. But then the unthinkable happened.   
 

I opened my eyes and saw my father sitting on the bed, one of his hands gripping me tightly, his eyes frightened, and his other hand pointed toward the back of the room:  
 

<< Look over there! Look over there!>>  
 

Terror enveloped me, what was he talking about? I didn't have the courage to look away so I kept looking at my father.  
 

<< Look over there! What the hell is that?!>>  
 

Once again I didn't have the courage to look. The fear of seeing one of my nightmares in reality terrified me.  
 

In this case, the natural response of the human being is fight or flight. I chose the latter and leaned my face against the pillow, squeezing my eyes shut as hard as I could.  
 

Then nothing. I remember absolutely nothing of what happened. My father and I never talked about it and I let it fall into oblivion, convincing myself that it was only a dream.  
 

But what if it wasn't? Did my father also see something in my room? Or did I just dream it? Yet I have some experience with dreams and that, I can say with certainty, was not one.";16175893300
Chatter box;9;0;"“It’s hot in here”.

I recoiled in terror as my wife’s vulval lips parted to speak those words. They let out a sordid sigh only to sleep in unison again. 

This began happening rarely or I just wasn’t going down on her enough. But sooner than I would want, it became a regular affair. While my wife reveled violently in the throes of passion; damp whistles, and verbose gurgles would keep me company. We became friends. It would recite tales of humidity and UTIs while I would talk about sales and targets.

It wasn’t long enough before I began sharing deep secrets with it.

“I squashed a worm mercilessly when I was 8”.

“Is it?”

“Yes. I even had a mad crush on my biology teacher when she ruffled my hair in front of the entire class”.

“I see”.

“Tell me something interesting about yourself, except the mean candida that you caught last month, haha.”

I could hear the lips part to open up the marshy abyss and let out a great big sigh.

A final word to my beloved;18;1;"Hello again.

&#x200B;

It's been a while since we last saw each other, hasn't it? So much has happened, and yet you've been there for absolutely none of it. Bittersweet, but fitting, I suppose. I'd rather you were kept as far away from the present as possible. My life has not been very good recently, and I'd rather just leave you to your rest.

&#x200B;

I followed your instructions, and I found it. It was right where you said it would be. It's so... 

**Shiny.**

&#x200B;

But something isn't right. In retrospect, I should have left it where it was. But I love you too much to ignore your direction. And yet, I feel unfulfilled, as something seems to have taken a dislike to me taking it from its spot. It doesn't seem to follow me, but knows where I am at any given time. I can't avoid its gaze, but I can never fully tell where its eyes are, if it even has any. I don't even think it wants me, though I can make it want me. It seems more preoccupied in making small, minor things in my life go wrong. I've never seen it, either. But I know it's there.

&#x200B;

I just want to know why you wanted me to have it. Did you know this would happen? I know that it's a lie, obviously, but it's intriguing nonetheless.

&#x200B;

It began with contrived disappearances. My toothbrush, a piece of cutlery from the drawer, pillowcases in the night, even one of my fingernails. That one hurt. Loose change, spare keys, anything to make me stop and wonder what was around me.

&#x200B;

Then came the important ones.

&#x200B;

It stole your wedding ring. I cried and cried and cried for nights on end because I knew innately that no matter how far I looked, I would never ever find it. Then it stole the cat. He was my last companion in my loneliness. Perhaps it left his mangled vessel, skinned, eyelids sown shut as a reminder of my misdeed.

&#x200B;

I gave up when it desecrated your final resting place.

&#x200B;

I was simply visiting to confide in you. Give you flowers. Wish that you were still here. Imagine your hands on me, freeing me of the biting cold and toxic snow. And yet, it was not to be.

&#x200B;

Seeing your bones appear in dark red snow only dropped me further beyond.

&#x200B;

I have a gift for you.

&#x200B;

I spent all of today making a cake for us. I made it sweeter than honey, decorated so beautifully it could be put in a gallery. It's perfect, just like you were. Perhaps my love will attract it. I should be dead, but I'm not. That can be changed. I'm going to leave it in bed tonight, right where you used to wrap your arms around me. If I'm correct, my tormentor will have its prize, and as will I; there's only one thing left for me to do now.

&#x200B;

I'm going to come find you.";16175656410
Your Legs May Take You;105;4;"Six years ago I purchased a hamster from a dear friend. After some deliberation I name him Frankie. We became pals overnight it seemed. I'd feed him treats, and sometimes I'd let him roam around the house with my supervision. Frankie gave great cuddles and great kisses. His previous owner had clearly treated him well.

Frankie was a great companion - he never let me down. Always there for me when I needed him, and always skipped around in my presence, like I gave him endless joy. 

But then Frankie started to change.

His behaviour towards me became apprehensive. His voice became higher pitched, more strained. Most of the time he was running on his wheel. Every time I'd check up on him I'd see him frantically going for it. He'd never look my way. Perhaps he wanted to burn of all those treats I was feeding him. I figured I was probably overthinking it.

Then one day I observed him running for quite some time. For two minutes he kept up the same insane pace, as quickly as his legs could take him. Everything alright there, buddy? I asked him. Still he wouldn't look at me. 

""Come on now, Frankie,"" I sighed, ""give yourself some rest. You'll have a heart attack.""

I walked over to his cage and rested my hand on it. Then I unclicked the lock and slowly opened the door. He jumped out of his wheel and sprinted out of the cage.

*Rick-a-tick, rick-a-tick*, as his small feet raced across the wooden floor.

""Hey, where are you going to?"" I asked him desperately.

Before I knew it he was out of sight.

Then I felt a coldness behind me, and a shadow loomed over the floor beside me. I turned and saw a dark figure standing there looking at me. It passed through me once and I went dizzy, then I saw it loitering by the door. Its appearance became fuzzier. My breathing got shorter, and I tried to speak but I was powerless. Then the dark figure approached me once more and merged into my body and I was no more.

Frankie didn't want to see me die.";16175200710
In your dreams you can do anything...;49;5;"I have never been a risk taker. I have always followed every rule and every polite social convention to the letter, even if I think they are stupid. I am an obedient daughter, an obedient employee, an obedient member of society. But at night I leave my inhibitions in the waking world and act on every desire in my dreams. 

Most dreams are  quite innocent. I dream of eating cake while on a diet. I dream of skydiving. I dream of swearing at my boss instead of silently taking his verbal abuse. I dream of punching the man who catcalled me. I dream of plugging in the broken electric guitar in the back of her closet and making enough noise to drown out the neighbors who are always having very loud sex when I am trying to sleep.

I wake up each morning feeling guilty about my imagined misbehavior and try to be more self-disciplined to atone for it.

One night my dreams became more disturbing.

I dream that I choke my boss with the cake that I know I shouldn’t eat, shoving handfuls of the calorie-rich chocolate sponge down his throat until frosting drips from his mouth. His insulting words turn first to pleas for mercy, and then to incoherent mumbling, and then to silence.

I dream that I invite the man who catcalled me to go on a skydiving date. On the plane, I cut the string of his parachute when he isn’t paying attention. As we tumble through the sky, I observe his annoyance at not being able to deploy the parachute turn into terror at the realization that he is falling to his death.

I dream that I take a string from the electric guitar and sneak into her neighbors’ apartment, waiting in their closet until they have fallen asleep after their noisy nightly routine. I creep up to the bed, wrap the wire around a neck and pull as hard as I can, watching the blood spill out and stain the white sheets. The second time is even more gratifying. The body thrashes underneath me, but with each futile attempt to escape the wire cuts deeper until at last there is no more resistance. I dip my fingers in the blood and sigh in happiness at perfect silence around me.

When I wake up, my dream is only a distant blur of crimson and a smear of guilt.

The trouble with wanting to know the future.;66;11;"Our world changed when scientists were able to create particles that moved faster than light. Once we broke that limitation, we were able to change our perspective on everything, literally. The tachyonic particle was once thought to be an impossibility, until the scientists at CERN made the revolutionary break through. It wasnt long after that when they began to militarize the tachyonic particle that it started getting sold to large corporations and wealthy elites. 

The thing about this particle is that people were using it to peer into the future. Im not entirely caught up on the science of it, but it has something to do with bouncing the Tachyonic particles off objects and viewing them through some special monitoring equipment. With this new equipment, the world was able to see into the future and make adjustments or alterations to the timeline as necessary. What a great time to be alive. Pre-crime departments became a thing and fortune telling became a legitimate practice, although we quickly found out that once you look into the future, it changes, everytime. So this ability became similar to meteorology where they use their equipment and their science to make the best educated guess that they can, and go off of that. 

NASA sent a tachyoscope, a future seeing telescope, into space to view the earth to monitor large scale earth events. This is where the problem came in. Once they turned it on and viewed the future, they changed it. It became apparent that the Tachyonic Particle they developed didnt tell us the future, it altered your molecules to mirror a seperate timeline. So when they shot the entire earth with Tachyonic Particles, the whole planet jumped into a different timeline. One where the earth had no atmosphere and there was no life at all. I sat in the space station and watched as 12 billion people suffocated and froze in the vaccume of space. 

We wil be attempting to save our planet by making a manned mission to NASA headquarters in Dallas, Texas to attempt to move our planet into another timeline. Everyone has died, but humanity can still live on. There are small pockets of humanity that has escaped the timeline jump. We are relaying instructions to them as we speak in the hope of saving as many lives as possible. 

If you are watching this, hearing this, or reading this, you must know that we have sent this message out through the tachyoscope in hopes of reaching other worlds in other timelines. 

Do not experiment with Tachyonic Particles. Do not experiment with Faster-than-light-anything! We broke this limit and suffered dearly for it. But if you do proceed without caution to our warning, then may you realize the truth behind your creation before it destroys you, as it did us.";16175250760
The Afterlife.;19;2;"As I write this in the ward, I tremble. I hope to every higher power that exists that I am wrong, but deep inside I know it is true.

It started yesterday, I was driving to work. My usual route, nothing special, said goodbye to my wife - Kate - and the kids in the morning, had breakfast at that pancake place on the 5th. As per normal. There was this guy, I don't know in his 30s? 40s maybe. Speeding in one of those vintage mustang's, idiot didn't pay attention until we collided. I tried to swerve out of the way, but his car simply smashed into my side door and it was over.

I blacked out. When I came to I was in a room. A pale white room. Suffocatingly small, there was just enough space for my body, I couldn't even move my hands. I couldn't move at all. 

Then I heard a voice.

""Welcome Human.""

The space was so tiny and claustrophobic that I couldn't even open my mouth to respond. 

""You are in the Afterlife.""

The white wall in front of me moved forward just a tiny bit, allowing me space to breathe and talk again. I was bleeding my nose was broken for just an instant before healing itself. I screamed at the voice, telling it to let me out.

No response.

 I pleaded for it to tell me where I was and it complied.

""The Afterlife.""

'This must be Hell I remember thinking to myself, but why? I lived a good life, I was a good man, why me?'

""I can see what you are thinking"" bellowed the voice from above.

""You see, there is no Hell. No Heaven and nothing more than this. There were never any pearly gates or fire and brimstone, never any Nirvana or Hindu paradise. There is just the after. I will leave you now, forevermore.""

The room then opened up. 

I fell into the blinding white. Almost like pure light. I fell and fell and fell, flailing about but it just continued. For infinity. I must have fallen in countless directions among the white for thousands of years, I could not die nor could I do anything. I could still think, but only to cry and scream about everything I had lost. Yet my eyes would not tear and my mouth would not move.

Suddenly, the voice returned.

""It seems your time is not yet up. You shall be returned to your human host.""

Then I woke up in my hospital bed. One hour.
One hour had passed since the crash.  

As I write this, I cry and weep. For I know nothing can save us. 

Ignorance truly is strength.";16175473360
Keep Talking;11;0;"Emelie walked slowly towards the front door of her house. She grabs the handle and turned it while mumbling. Emelie kept mumbling words, not too soft and not too loud. Just enough for another person to hear her. Her sore throat didn't help in her mumbling. The air around her was so hot, that it could bake a cake. She walks straight ahead, onto the grass.

She steps slowly the heat started to make her feel dizzy.
She feels her mouth, drying up.
Emilie walks on the field and stepped on the exposed nail. She screamed and watched her feet bleed. No matter how sad, angry and tired Emelie was, no tears formed in her eyes. She walked past a pile of bodies, bodies of the creatures and her neighbors' corpses. She looks up into the sky, still mumbling words. The sun shone brightly.

She continues mumbling. At this point, she's not even mumbling words anymore. They were sounds, mixed up letters. She had made up words so she could keep talking.
She remembered how normal things were, yesterday. “If only I could go back”, she thought while mumbling. She had been mumbling for as long as she could remember.

She thought of the day before and realized, nightfall hadn't occured.
So, she wasn't sure, how long it had been since they had arrived. She hadn't kept track of time since the arrival of the creatures.
Emelie slowly walked towards a corpse. It looked familiar to her.
Beside the corpse, Emelie found a bloody notebook.
She took it and read the open page that was partially covered in blood. She read the words, aloud to replace her mumbling.

“Day #96

My name is John and I live with my wife and my children. It's been a few months, since the arrival of the creatures. Food and water supply is running out. Those creatures, they're something that I haven't seen before. Their heads are extremely large with multiple layers, they're larger than people and they hunt by speech or I don't know. They have tentacles, or something.

From what I've observed is that if you start talking, they attach themselves onto your body. Then, you need to keep talking or they'll kill you. Instantly. They stock up the bodies and form a half of a pyramid. They keep adding bodies to complete the pyramid. They're trying to make the pyramid reach the big circle that hovers above the skies, since their arrival. This is my last entry, since I'm running out of paper.
To the person reading this, please look for my wife; Emelie Callison. She has long blonde hair with green eyes. Honey, we tried hard. I love you.”.

For the first time in a while, tears formed in her eyes. She stood still. Not uttering anything, she closed her eyes as a shriek came from behind her.";16175508220
Pyracantha;9;1;"Pyracantha is an ornamental shrub whose name means Fire Thorn. It is related to the rose. Over the years, it has become unexplainably monstrous and it spreads with a conquering, invasive haste. Every part is now colossal and sinister. We are losing against it.

Thorns the length of spears are home to hordes of impaled bodies. Our blood is liquid food, our flesh merely compost.

The plant blooms with toxic flowers and tempting berries. It monopolises the sun, snatching light from all others. Its roots are draining the oceans.

Inside the maze of branches are the harpies. The birds that once gorged on the berries have mutated into ragged scavengers, their gnarled faces now resembling that of old, bitter women. Their birdsong sounds like the laughter of witches.

Abandoned at the top of the London Shard, forty-three survivors congregate. All the previous floors are stricken with the plant, its sable tinged branches twisted and thick. Spines have lanced office furniture and pierced through floors and ceilings.

In a fortnight's time the pyracantha will break through to the roof, so some of us have decided to descend this capricious devil. Nearly half have decided to stay though, mostly the ones with children. I don't understand. This is all there is.

So the rest of us begin the climb. We crawl out of a window on all fours, balancing on the branches.

Jane was the first to die. She lost her balance. I watched her tumble about sixty feet until a thorn halted her fall. A harpy quickly tore apart her twitching body.

Many others followed.

Burns from grazing past the flowers were untreatable. Some struggled on, suffering. Others, the noisy ones, were put out of their misery.

The harpies saw the children as the easiest prey. We tried to fight them off but there were too many and our position precarious. I nearly fell, avoiding a vicious swipe. In the end the rest of us fled. Susan and Iqra stayed to try and save their sons. We heard their wailing for hours.

On the second day, Dan stupidly ate from one of the berries. Dan used to be my boss. He always tried to promote himself as more resolute than the rest. He wasn't. We had to push him off. He was turning into something.

On the fifth day, our rations and water had gone. We pillaged any bodies we could find but rarely found anything useful. Addo and Irene succumbed to fatigue. The harpies fought over their tumbling remains.

The next morning, I was warmed by a streak of light. I crawled carefully to see where it was coming from. I reached the edge and saw the reflections from the top of the Shard. While we'd been descending, the pyracantha had been growing exponentially.

We had gone nowhere.

In the distance I heard the final screams of my friends as the harpies overwhelmed them. I was now alone, trapped inside this infernal cage.

The harpies laughed knowingly at my fate.";16175484970
Silence;59;5;"He produced such beautiful music when he was alive. Now, there is only the silence. 

I found his extinguished body in his studio. Slumped down onto itself, like a crumpled cardboard tube. 

After they carried him away, the spot of his death became a vacuum for sound. Someone could shout at me from right across the small studio and if that final resting spot of his was in-between us, no sound would ever reach me. It would just be swallowed up, and spat back out as silence. 

Not the standard kind of silence. Not the kind that feels welcome, that can be a cleansing rest for your senses. No, a sordid silence. One that magnifies the mechanical pump of blood in your ears, the ticking of the clock, the scraping of pen on paper while writing an obituary.

I scream into the silence that fills his coffin like a fluid. I shut the lid tight, my sound still reverberating inside. He left me his silence, I give him my voice.";16175077810
I only exist during the good times;13;2;"
I only exist during good times and when good times are gone everything becomes blank and i am in complete darkness. I don't mind it at all and i prefer to only exist when good times are here and be in complete darkness when good times are gone. When i was younger i would come back to existence when my mother wasn't being beaten anymore by my father. I would also come back to existence when my father wasn't being stabbed up by my psychotic mother. I was always in complete darkness when my father was struggling to pay bills or when my mother cheated on my father with another man so that she could get more heroin.

I know what it is like to die and it is complete darkness, and through out my teenage years i only existed when my bullies weren't bullying me or when the teachers were congratulating me. I was in complete darkness when I failed my exams or when my so called friends abandoned me. I was in complete darkness when my little brother went missing but i came to exist when my parents moved past it so quickly. I was in complete darkness when i had nothing to eat and i came to existence when there was food on my plate. One other good thing about not existing during the bad times in my life is having no memory of it at all or succumbing to any PTSD type of trauma.

I was in complete darkness when my parents started worshiping Satan and i was in complete darkness when they were complaining to satan about not upholding his bargain when they sacrificed my little brother. I came to existence when my parents got what they wanted with the big house and lots of money. Then i completely went back into the darkness when my parents had to pay satan back again with their lives. I am grateful i didn't exist when my parents were screaming and were trying to give me to satan and when i came back to existence, it was a good time because i didn't have my terrible parents anymore over me. I existed more longer than i have ever did in my whole life because with my parents being gone, my life had improved quite considerably.

Then i didn't exist anymore for quite a while and when i came back to exist it was because the person that had abducted me along with other strangers, he wasn't harming us anymore and i got to experience relief for a moment. Then i went back to not existing for a while and when I came back it was because our abductor had gone on holiday for a long time and had left us some food. For the time being we are safe from being tortured and being experimented on.";16175210750

“I have told exactly who I am. I am John Smith. I live in Huston I was born on April fourth, nineteen eighty four my parents are Bill and Crystal....” his words were becoming frantic but the man was cut off by the detective.

“I know that’s what your fake I.D. and your fake debit card said but we aren’t finding anything that matches you in our records.” The officer said pointing at the mans chest as they both sat in a cold interrogation room.

“You were just at my house! If you would have just let me inside... I don’t even know why that guy was changing my locks and I wasn’t fighting with him!”

“That not what he said John. He said you hit him when he didn’t let you inside. And that house was repossessed by the bank. There are no records of you owning it. Is there anyway you can prove it?”

“How can I prove it? You won’t let me look anything up or even go and get my paperwork.”

“We did go inside John, the place was empty and when we looked into ‘your’ car we were surprised to find it to be a missing model from the local dealership.”

“..... what? Are you trying to say I stole my car?” 

“Yes John. You stole that car and were trying to break into that house to hide after your ‘card’ failed at the gas station. At that house you fought the locksmith when he didn’t buy your story.”

“Are you joking?!” The man cuffed to the table tried to stand and struggled against his bonding. “I am John Smith that was my car and my house. Just check my phone!”

“What phone?” 

“You took it from me! What do you mean ‘what phone?’”.

“We don’t have a phone from you Mr. Smith.”

The mans struggling stopped, he started hyperventilating and felt the world was spinning.

The detective continued “You need to understand, you assaulted that locksmith and without some identification we are going to have to hold you until we figure out who you are.”

The man slumped in his chair and practically whispered “I am John... I am John please I can prove it. My email, my laptop, something...”

“If you can give us another address or real name we can get you processed and maybe out of here tonight. We will run your DNA and check your dental but I doubt we will find anything.”

PSA: Men of Reddit, the ritual for summoning a succubus has been changed.;75;12;"**Disclaimer:** If you're a dabbler who just wants to 'see if this works,' DO NOT SUMMON. If you think this is a joke and you want to try it for fun, DO NOT SUMMON. If you are not prepared to spend eternity in Hell as the sub of a sadomasochistic demon, DO NOT SUMMON.

Due to declining numbers, the inhabitants of the underworld have updated their evocation rituals. It is their hope that these changes will help them prey upon unsuspecting, lonely human males.

Below is a psychological profile of the target’s they’ve established:

*The targets are socially withdrawal, often avoiding or blocking any contact even with family members. They spend most of their time locked at their rooms, investing their time in particular interests and Internet use, only leaving to eat or do basic hygiene.*

*Often estranged from school and society, the young adult male is from a family with a good socioeconomic background. Persons spend most of the day avoiding exposure to any form of socialization (at school, sport centers, and similar socializing contexts) for days, weeks, or months at a time.*

*Typical interests involve video games and binge-watching television shows. Diet is often poor, consisting of fast food that can be home delivered or heated up in a microwave.*

If the profile above describes you, I’d advise you to read on.

The *new* steps for completing the ritual are listed below. They needn’t be performed in order and are non-expiring (i.e. if you perform the first one at 18 years of age and the last at 80, it will **still** call a succubus).

Please read each step very carefully, then take whatever measures are necessary to avoid them:

1. Go 6 months without having sex after the age of 18.

2. Avoid showering for 3 consecutive days

3. Have a poor diet/ generally act in a lazy or gluttonous manner (frequently eating foods such as Doritos, Hot Pockets, or tendies will fulfill this part of the ritual)

4. Spend more than 10 hours in a single day browsing social media (this includes Reddit) and/or playing video games

5. Let the last drop of urine go into your underwear

6. Absentmindedly touch your junk in a nonsexual way more than five times in one week

7. Read or even see the phrase, ""Mi sangas pro la vundoj de inferaj trancxoj!""

Luckily, only a complete dirtbag would find themselves unwittingly completing every step, but if for any reason you do, you’ll have five minutes (at most) until the succubus comes to claim you as her consort. After that, you will be subjected to an eternity of sexual torment and pain beyond words.

Remember: Stay alert. Stay vigilant.

It could very well save your immortal soul...";16174779810
The Cards You're Dealt;41;6;"“Alright, Stephen… deep breaths... Now, we're going to choose the ones that call out to you,” I spoke in a calm voice. I could tell that he was way out of his depth and I was doing my best to make it easier for him. Even still, his breathing was rapid as his hand hovered over the Tarot deck. 

&#x200B;

I winced a little as his fingers rested on the first card, already knowing what it was. His second card wasn’t any better, or the third. I collected the rest of the deck and arranged the ones he had chosen in a neat row, mentally preparing myself for the task ahead of me.

&#x200B;

“So, I'm not the most conventional psychic...“

&#x200B;

I turned the first card over for him, watching his eyes grow wide as The Devil was revealed.

&#x200B;

“And these cards aren’t meant to be taken literally, in most cases...“

&#x200B;

I paused to turn the the next card over, The Ten of Swords glared back at us. The bleak image always made my skin crawl. 

&#x200B;

“However, you’re a special case,” I finished, letting him take in the imagery for a few moments before I turned the final card over. Stephen whimpered loudly as Death stared back at him. 

&#x200B;

I’d known how this reading would go from the moment I was drawn to his home. I'd gone through each room while I waited for him to arrive, learning all I needed to know. Stephen kept everything he owned so perfectly arranged and precise. Here was a man so meticulously boring, so calculatedly ordinary, a man who was careful not to draw attention to himself. 

&#x200B;

I placed his severed hand on the table beside the cards and walked to the mantle, where the only out of place item in Stephen’s home was resting. I brought the necklace over to him and held it in front of his face.

&#x200B;

“Tell me about Madeline,” I rasped, watching him squirm against his restraints. 

&#x200B;

“Tell me, or I can get the saw back out,” I repeated, gesturing to his remaining hand. I retrieved a photograph of Madeline from my briefcase. The necklace around her neck was the same one dangling in front of his fearful eyes.

&#x200B;

“You killed her. Didn’t you?” I persisted. Stephen looked up at me in defeat, finally finding his voice.

&#x200B;

“…Yes…” he gasped between staggered breaths. I nodded, finally getting the confession I needed. 

&#x200B;

“Alright, Stephen. That just about wraps up our session.”

&#x200B;

I began collecting my belongings, placing the necklace and Stephen’s hand into plastic bags as evidence for Madeline's parents, proof that I had found her killer. I had one last task to perform, as per their request. 

&#x200B;

I doused the home in gasoline and stepped out into the night. It was definitely time for a cigarette. 

&#x200B;

“Later, Stephen,” I called, flicking the butt into the doorway. I watched the flames engulf the house in my rearview, satisfied..

Back in the Basement;10;2;"Low ceiling, cold air and and a smell of moldy potatoes, everything was as Tim remembered it.
“Nothing,“ Maren said. “See?“ 

Even with all her love, she‘d finally lost patience. Gone the way his friends, parents and therapists had gone before. That tone in her voice. 

“I want to check it out,“ Tim said. Maren stroked his back. “I’ll wait in the car.“ When she was gone, he searched the corners.

“I know you’re somewhere,“ he said. He wondered did he mean his brother or the monster that had taken him twenty years ago when their grandmother locked him in this basement for setting fire to a farmer‘s bale of straw. She’d opened it by late afternoon and his brother was gone. Grandma had died shortly afterwards, leaving a house so full of tragedy nobody would ever buy it. Her death had been one of heart failure and feelings of guilt. In the long run, the monster had taken two of his family. 

Tim brought out the knife he’d hidden from Maren and stood with the blade in one and his phone flashlight in the other hand. “I’m not afraid,“ he said, the trembling light proving him a liar. Of course the monster in the basement had been waiting for him to be alone. It had done the same to his brother. Today however, it would end. 

Tim sniffed. There was a sour smell. Slight at first, then stronger. The monster’s stink. His heart began to race and he turned around and around in search for the smell‘s origin. The trapdoor shut. “Maren?“ 

Tim realized the walls looked moist and as if they were moving. The air was so pregnant with sourness now he could hardly breathe and went for the exit. He slipped, flailing his arms to keep the balance. As he looked down he saw the soles of his sneakers melting. The floor was wet with a fluid, the same as on the walls, the same sour smell.

When the soles had dissipated, Tim’s socks were no match for the corrosive liquid. It was at his skin now. It felt like cutting his feet with a razor first and then holding them into a bowel of boiling vinegar. 

Tim ran for the trapdoor on feet that he felt had no more soles, just like the sneakers. This time when he slipped, he fell. The liquid burned into his hands. He raised them and saw a bone moving as the skin of his palms was eaten away. It was a blurred view through eyes flooded by tears.

When Tim inhaled now,  a thousand needles pierced his lungs. Before the burning torment of being digested erased all rational thought, he couldn’t help but realize they’d all been right, his parents, Maren, the therapists, everybody: There was no monster in this basement.";16174993600
Meal time;29;5;"My favourite book was a very strange one. It had no beginning, and no end. It just seemed lime I started reading it, and when I flicked to the front it was where I had last read.

I was reading it one day, and I realised that a character had the same name as I do. What’s more, is that a few pages later an illustration of the character looked just like I did.

It described ‘me’ as a flesh-eating murderer, and how I was wanted all over the country. I always wondered where I went in my dreams.

Then I felt the urge come over me, and heard the sirens in the distance. Meal time.";16174769060
Killer Act;135;6;"Jared listened to the thundering cheers of the audience, the boisterous throng sloshing soddenly about the arena, waves spontaneously forming and dissipating, seats long forgotten. He forced himself to smile; sweat poured from his hair and washed over his face. He felt his right leg go weak; he caught himself before he fell. The crowd drank all of this in, hungry for more. Famished for the evening's crescendo. He shuddered as he felt pummeled by their ravenous longing.

No reason to stall...he knew what was coming next. ""And now...the moment you've been waiting for..."" It seemed impossible that the crowd's cacophony could become any more ear-splitting, but somehow they managed. The deafening roar threatened to knock him over.

He screamed into the microphone. ""This is the main event!"" Any increase in the crowd's volume seemed pointless, as the very air was on the verge of shattering. Jared looked nervously to the side of the stage, to the large man with the thousand-mile stare, eyes locked on him, not even blinking. The plaintive guitars heralded the beginning of the evening's final song, an old Monster Magnet tune with apropos lyrics.

He began belting the vocals, hardly even thinking, the words coming to him by automatic reflex. He felt moments of them, the ones that resonated most strongly with the crowd...""Just set that plastic soul on fire, and watch it melt..."" He continued to sing by rote, unable to think about it, or to accept the audience's reaction. He saw the large man pull something from his belt, and tried desperately to put it out of his mind.

He was running out of lyrics. ""But I'm just laughing in the flames..."" The large man strode purposefully towards him. ""I feel I can fly..."" As if. With his last shreds of energy, he belted out the coda: ""And then sometimes I dig it so much...I could die.""

He barely felt the first slash of the well-honed machete; he had been drowning in adrenaline all night. The numbness was gratefully welcomed. The next blow struck his skull; he felt his thoughts skip a beat. He had heard brain injuries were really strange to experience. The large man's adrenaline must have kicked in too, for he began hacking savagely at Jared's crumpled form. The pain began to seep through his foggy consciousness, but just as quickly, his awareness collapsed as the light poured out of him.

Spattered in blood and gore, tonight's lucky sweepstakes winner raised his machete in the air and screamed triumphantly. Another night's great entertainment had drawn to a close. The condemned criminal had been served justice after an evening of his own choosing, and the money from the tickets to the exclusive event had paid down some of the damage he had caused. The vengeful hordes relished their show, and the due process of law-abiding society had triumphed once again.";16174446070
Drano;1187;122;"Timmy O'Connell was always a weird little fucker, you know. He’d do some crazy shit, like put crayons up his nose to color his snot, swallow bucketloads of earthworms to “clean his stomach”, and jab needles between his toes for seemingly no reason.

But all that pales in comparison to the now infamous Drano-incident. It was the day before fourth of July, which I guess would make it July third, and I was hovering around Timmy in the old parking garage. He’d told me he had something “absolutely amazing” to show me, and morbidly curious fucker as I were, you didn’t have to ask me twice.

“You have pets Charlie?” he asked me idly. 

“Yeah,” I nodded. “A dog, Brian, and I had a rabbit, but my sister flushed him down the toilet.”

“Well that’s messed up,” he noted.

“It’s alright, I flushed her parrot down as payback.”

“Glad that worked out for you,” he said with some disinterest. “But do you know about bugs?”

“Do I know about them?” I asked, somewhat perplexed. “Yeah, I mean, doesn’t everyone?”

He stood up from his yoga-like position, an eerily calm and relaxed manner about him, the kind you’re not supposed to see in an eleven year old.

“Bugs as pets,” Timmy said matter-of-factly. “Do you know about bugs as pets?”

I stared at him for a moment, those mesmerizing pale blue eyes of his hiding any intent behind his bizarre line of questioning.

“Erm,” I started. “No. You can’t have bugs as pets.”

“Sure you can!” he exclaimed loudly. “In fact, they’re the best pets you can ever have!”

“But how do you feed them? And you can’t take them for walks. Or pet them. What’s the point?”

“You can do all those things,” he murmured ominously. “And more!”

“Nuh-uh,” I shook my head. “I don’t believe it.”

“Oh yeah? That’s why I brought you here, Charlie. To show you.”

“Show me what?”

“Drano,” he whispered, a sly smile stretching across his face.

“What’s that?”

“My pet tick.”

“Tick?!”

Timmy threw his head back and laughed then. I could see that something was different about him, but I was too young to understand what the fuck was going on.

“I feed him, take him for walks, and pet him. I’ve been doing it all along, while we’ve been talking.”

“How? Where is he?”

He walked up to me, you know, real fucking close. Eyeball to eyeball I guess you could say. And then, slowly, real fucking slowly, he brought his index finger closer and closer to his eye.

“Charlie,” he whispered softly. “Meet Drano.”

I still get sick thinking about it, you know. Many lunches and dinners have come back up again when I revisit that moment.

A big black spot emerging from under his eyelid. A bulbous shape, round and plump, swollen with Timmy’s blood. Tiny bug feet clawing and scratching along his retina, struggling to emerge.

“He’s the bestest boy in the whole wide world,” Timmy chuckled.";16173971010
The room in my basement;18;2;" 

I had moved into this house only a couple weeks ago. It sold for an extremely cheap price, considering the size of the house. The previous owner left behind a lot of things, and it almost felt like I walked into someone else's house. I was never a fan of antique furniture. I was rummaging through some drawers when I found a key. It was a very small key, practically just a handle, but a key nonetheless. It was dark, dark enough so that at times, I believed that there was a key shaped hole in my hand. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but the next day, I remembered my conversation with the estate agent.

*“Oh that room? It’s just an old storage room. Barely bigger than a pantry. I doubt there would be any use for it.”*

*“Can I look inside?”*

*“I don’t think that will be necessary.”* It struck me that this must be the key to the room. Extra storage space was good, even if it’s small. When I headed down into the basement with that awful black key in my hand, I finally realised how unnerving the door really was. There wasn’t anything inherently creepy about the door itself, no blood splattered on the handle, no sections rotting, no noises from the other side. Maybe it was just because someone wasn’t there with me. I then became aware of my hands sweating. *There’s no need for sweating*, I thought. I wiped my hands on my shirt, feeling my heart pounding. *Maybe it’s all those scary stories getting to me,* I thought. I raised my hand level to the lock, struggling to even align it. *Maybe it is just a storage room,* I thought. I finally got the key into the lock, and turned it. I slowly opened the door, expecting some monster to jump out at me, or to see a corpse lying on the ground.

It was an empty room. No monsters. No dead bodies. I saw a rat dart across the room, but that was to be expected. But something was definitely off. The room was nowhere near the size of a pantry. As I walked into the room, I was expecting to find some note on the ground saying some vague threat, but there was no note. Upon further inspection, there were no cracks, pipes or anything else in the walls or ceiling. It was in fact an empty room.

I never did use that room for storage. It still freaks me out. Seven whole years later, and it still freaks me out. I keep the black key on me at all times. I don’t know why. In fact, I still check up on the room every now and then. Maybe it’s because that same rat is still there.";16174760260
Summer Job;8;2;"I knew I was in trouble the moment my foot fell into that hole at the bottom of the lake.

Who could say that the bear trap that had been setup underwater, wasn't an accident?  All I cared about though, was trying to figure out how to get back to the surface now.

See, I'd taken a summer job scuba diving in golf course lakes to retrieve long lost golf balls and clear out any garbage.  The biggest danger with this job, are the big gators that frequent these lakes and quite often.  With murky deep water and who knows whats exactly down there, you take a risk and get paid pretty well for it under-the-table.

Now though, after diving for almost an hour now, I know I have at least five to eight minutes of air left before I drown.  I look up at the surface above, a brownish mirror waiting to be broken.  All around me are broken bottles, multicolored golf balls, and this cursed bear trap biting into my right ankle.  It's in the bone, having crushed it hard enough to actually embed it's wicked teeth into me. 

My only salvation is this non-serrated diving knife.  I don't know if I have enough time to cut myself free and escape in what time I have left.  Can I really do an underwater amputation in five minutes?!  I try anyway, I cut away the wet suit pant leg and start sawing away madly at the flesh and bone above the traps teeth.  My breathing picks up and I find myself screaming inside of my mask, watching pain and terror filled air bubbles rise to the surface for release.

I feel the knife strike the bone and I nearly black out from it.  When my vision refocuses I see that I am still surrounded by broken glass, multicolored golf balls, my blood, and now two very hungry gators.";16174912970
Why is there blood on the cookies?;237;16;"Was supposed to go home two hours ago. Can’t; have to keep working. So many customers. So many orders. The line goes to the door. When did we open? How much longer until we close?

Why is there blood on the cookies? Oh no all good. Not blood, just extra frosting. Keep moving. Can’t fall behind. Next customer. How many? Which box? Gift wrapped? Apologies we don’t offer shipping. Please take your package to register. 

Blink and the light is different. How late is it? When did I eat last? Why is my vision blurry? Yessir some items are gluten free. Be careful of cross contamination though. No allergy? No matter? Ok good here is your box.

Crack my neck to relieve some tension. Ah a crick. Neck feels stuck. All good, keep working. Next customer please. 4 chocolate macaroons and an oatmeal cookie? Absolutely m’amn. Here are your items. God but my neck hurts.

Why is there blood on the cookies? Who are these new people? The ceiling is dusty, that light is flickering; should order a new bulb. Ah but the floor is hard. Suddenly lifted; so tired.

An unfortunate lapse of attention;29;2;"I had been stumbling around the station for nearly 40 minutes. Searching.

It had only been a few seconds,  yet he had managed to get so far from me. This was exhausting. I felt the weight of the silence grow excruciatingly dense after each cry, after each futile attempt to call out to him. 

I was beginning to fear he wasn't at the station anymore.

Deciding it best to check every where a third time, I started my way back to the entrance. 

Not a minute later,  I bumped into a young man who was deeply lost in thought. 

""Have you seen my son?"" I asked,  jolting him back to reality. ""I've looked all over and I can't find him anywhere"".

He paused for a moment, thinking. 
""... Purple shirt,  short brown hair, about 5 or 6 years old?""

""Yes,  that's him"" I exclaimed, relief welling up inside of me. 

""Haven't seen him, sorry.""";16174565680
Now They'll Believe;16;1;"Javits slowed. The clicking of their claws against the stone and the chittering noises they used to echolocate in the darkness were fading. Those things, whatever they were, were still after him, but they were falling behind. Ahead, he could just make out the dim light filtering down through the hole in the cavern’s roof, illuminating the ladder underneath. He could almost hear the murmur of hundreds of rush hour commuters milling around the subway platform just beyond. Leaning against the rough granite wall, he stopped to catch his breath. It had been close. Those monsters nearly got him, twice. But now he was almost there. He was going to make it.

If only he had just lied, none of this would be happening.

The floor had collapsed in a service corridor at the J Street Station, revealing a low, narrow cavern below. If that cave ran under the rails, it would spell trouble, so Javits’ crew was sent down to check it out. Four guys went in. He was the only one to make it out.

He told the cops everything, about the monsters attacking his crew, how they ripped his friends to shreds. Of course, nobody believed him. The SWAT team they sent down to investigate found only bits and pieces of Javits’ coworkers. And blood. Lots and lots of blood. Over the next couple of months, Javits had been ridiculed mercilessly by the press, arrested on murder charges, and eventually committed to a psych ward when they didn’t have enough evidence to convict. But no matter how much the reporters badgered him, no matter how much the cops roughed him up during interrogations, no matter how many drugs the shrinks pumped into his veins, he stuck to his story. It was the truth.

Javits lost everything; his job, his pension. Lawyer fees ate up his savings. His wife filed for divorce and took the house, the car, the kids, even the dog. There was only one thing left for him to do; he had to go back down into the cavern and find some way to prove the creatures actually existed. It was the only way to get his life back. So here he was.

Behind him, the chittering and scrabbling faded. The creatures were retreating back into the depths.

“C’mon ya bastards!” he shouted into the darkness. “Come and get me!”

There was silence for a moment, then the beasts surged forward with the roar of a passing subway train. He could feel the air they displaced flowing over his sweaty skin like a breeze. There must be hundreds of them. He turned and sprinted for the ladder.

Javits could only imagine the looks on peoples’ faces when all these monsters came pouring out of the service corridor and tore into the crowd at the J Street Station.

“Now they’ll believe me!” he giggled. “Now they’ll definitely believe me!”";16174671490
Rattle;5;3;"Every night they waited, the somber hours of the night passing by as the held their breaths. The pale moon was raised and looking down on the small town that waited, glancing over them as the hours passed in darkness. Mothers held their children close as fathers peered through their windows surveying a dark fog for some glimpse past its thick barrier.

Every door was locked as well as every window bolted, though this offered small peace for some, others knew this was futile. Just like the day turning to night, no one could stop what was coming, though many had tried. The only hope for salvation lay in the hands of God, but those who prayed found their cries for salvation often fell on deaf ears.

Soon they would all hear it, the soft unassuming rattle growing closer ever slowly. It was a sound they were all familiar with, the clinking of keys against one another. They would hear the rattle pass slowly along the house, then as they looked on in pensive anticipation, they would view a shadow from beneath their door.

The echo of metal against metal would ring throughout the house as the shadow placed its key inside the lock of their doors. Children would close their eyes and listen for the sound of the key twisting in the lock, for the sound of cylinders turning. They would listen and pray, knowing what dark fate would wait for them if they heard a click, if they heard the twist of metal.

When the moon fell the people would gather outside in silent agreement on what must be done. They would go house to house and look for the one whose door was open, soon they would find it and quickly they would go inside to find what they always found. Fathers and Mothers holding children in their arms, paler than the moon, lifeless where they lay. Dead eyes of petrified tears still looking to their door, the door the shadow’s key had fit.";16174860040
Letters to Marietta;42;0;"“To my dearest Marietta”

I stroke the thick, cream colored paper as I dream up another romantic poem, another gracious declaration of love. My pen glides left and right, twisting and turning into letters, each an exquisite work of art. 

“Your eyes were swirling kaleidoscopes of skies, tossing and turning in their own small infinities.” 

I stop for a moment, and recall Marietta’s gorgeous features. She was so delicate, so...

Ethereal. An otherworldly beauty. I pick up the pen and continue. 

“Your laugh reminded me of twinkling bells and the chirping of morning birds.”

I remembered our first date, the way Marietta had smiled as we walked across the river bank and watched the glittering stars in the sky. 

“But its much too bad, why did this have to end in such a way, why did you make me do this Marietta. We could have had something special, you know?”

I stop to call forth the memory of our final night together. I smile maliciously, as I recall her sipping from the flask, finishing every drop of poison in it. I think of how satisfied I had felt during those moments. I remember laughing as her eyes rolled into the back of her skull, as I emerged in a malicious, almost psychotic laughter. But that didn’t matter. Oh Marietta, it truly was much too bad...

I drop the letter into an envelope and close it with a red wax seal. Carefully, I pick up the stack of letters, and decide to pay Marietta a visit. 

The full moon shone in the night sky, as I trudged towards her grave. I eloquently place the letters next to the headstone shake my head with disappointment. 

“Oh Marietta...


Its a shame you never loved me back”

Then I head home, knowing that the beautiful Marietta would not let me sleep tonight, for she always stops by to greet me in my nightmares.";16174491630
The jet;3;1;"It was 4pm, and I was at the military base. I was going on an attack mission. I climbed into my F-15E, ready to take off. But something was wrong. Usually I wouldn't care that much, but this time it really felt wrong. I could hear something. I could hear breathing, and it wasn't my own.

Still, I took off. I was in the air for about 1 ½ hour. I landed, reported to our general and went to bed.

Next day, I did the same. Woke up, got ready and went to the landing ground. This time, I came there at 9am.

I was sat in my jet when I heard breathing again. This time, the plane even pulsated with every breath. And before I could react, the cockpit, along with the rest of the plane, turned into a huge, fleshy biomass and devoured me.

It was dark.

I couldn't breathe.

I only heard breathing.";16174919710
Itchy;13;2;"It started that Friday night, a tingling feeling deep inside my head. It wasn’t painful, no, not at first, just something unrelenting and hard to ignore, like trying to ignore a crying baby in the middle of the night. I gave it a gentle squeeze, stroking my scalp with my nails. Satisfied, the feeling subsided.

The next morning, the tingling feeling came back, stronger this time. I tried to ignore it, but it haunted me for the rest of the day. Furthermore, it started to spread, like some sort of infectious disease, down towards the rest of my body. Every hair I had was standing up on end, and it felt like my body was on fire. It was difficult trying to scratch everything, just like playing a never-ending game of Whac-A-Mole. If I tried to scratch one part, another would cry out for my attention, and soon my body was red and raw from raking my nails through my skin to soothe that irritating urge.

Nothing really helped other than scratching, not even a quick, warm shower, and I even went to the doctor. I got some cream to rub all over my red and raw body, but it was as useful as trying to rub a cold, dead fish all over yourself, you know? 

Therefore every night after that I would stare at myself in the mirror with hollow, dead eyes, looking like a freshly-plucked chicken, blood pooling out of freshly-scratched wounds.

But then one night my vision was suddenly clouded by a black and fuzzy head, which then tore itself out into the real world. It was followed by everything else: tiny, buzzy wings, short legs, and a zebra-striped abdomen that was filled with crimson blood that sloshed around. The bug then turned around, stared at me and buzzed its wings, as if to say thank you, and then took off into the inky-black night.

Then an entire stream of black oozed out from under my skin and under my eyeballs and from my ears and mouth and nose like thick, soupy noodles, and the air was full of harmonious buzzing from the wings, before soaring off  in a light, pulsing cloud.

I stared after them, wondering what had just occurred, but then glanced in the mirror and found that my skin had turned from silky smooth to rough and bumpy.

See, the mosquitoes had left me one last, little present.

Carefully nestled in each fold of my skin were a cluster of shimmering, translucent eggs, almost like little pearls. Then, the first eggs of each cluster started to crack.";16174687120
Focus on the sound;39;0;"It is in the middle of the night. It's raining steadily outside. You hear it tapping against the windows. 

You hear it get progresivly louder. It turns to hail, or at least you think it's hail. It sounds like it. It kinda sounds like someone  is knocking on the windows and doors. 

Are you sure it's hail? It could be some random kids throwing rocks at your house. Or maybe someone is trying to break in. You can't be sure. It's too dark to see anything. It's not like you can see anything when it's light out either. You lost your vision a couple months ago.  

Sounds are so confusing, aren't they? When you rely on your vision for everything. You never realized how difficult it is to figure out what you are hearing. A lot of sounds go unoticed. Not the hail though. The rain is so loud. You are trying to figure out what you are hearing. It's hard losing your vision. You need to focus on the sounds. You will get better at it. Hopefully soon. Because now it sounds like one of the windows just shattered. Although it's hard to hear because the window is in another room. But the rain sounds a little different now, doesn't it? You can hear it hitting the concrete. 

Now there are footsteps. Trust your gut feeling. You thought you heard someone breaking the window. Time to decide what to do. If only you didn't leave your cane in that room. You hear your cane tapping against the floor. Whoever is in your house has it. He will probably use it against you. 

So what are you going to do? Hide? Run? You can't run without your cane. You will most certainly trip over something. Hiding seems like the better option. Find somewhere to hide. Before he gets to the room. He can just go through the door. You didn't lock it...";16174405930
Ten Bags of Crack;87;6;"""Who the fuck are you?""


The thin man at the front door looked at Zed with a manner of disgust he was accustomed to.


""I'm Zed,"" Zed said.


The man pulled Zed inside and closed the door. ""Your dealer doesn't live here anymore. He was asked to leave. Come with me.""


Zed followed the man into the living room. The walls were lined with mould and old food. Sitting on the sofa was a wretched, obese man: naked, sweating and scratching at his groin.


""Ted, this is Zed,"" The thin man said to the fat man. ""He was looking for Blue Marvin.""


Ted sniffed. ""I've heard of you, Zed. Rumour is that you once let a rugby club take turns on you for £200. You hopheads are disgusting.""


Zed didn't reply. It wasn't the worst thing he'd done.


The fat man picked his nose and snarled at Zed. ""Let me guess. You want something but you have no money.""


Zed replied this time by saying that he would pay them both back. He had a burglary planned tonight. Loads of good stuff to sell afterwards.


Ted shuffled sideways, picking up a plate of greasy meat beside him. ""I'll give you ten bags of crack if you do something for me.""


Zed nodded okay.


The thin man interrupted. ""We have a body that needs disposing of. Are you game for ten bags of crack?""


Zed didn't ask whose body it was but did ask how he was supposed to get rid of it.


The fat man shifted on the sofa and farted. ""Fred has all the tools you'll need, Zed. Can't leave any trace behind though. You up for it? Fred here doesn't have the stomach for it today.""


Zed's own stomach churned. Withdrawal caused his shaking to intensify. He agreed. He needed that hit soon. His heart was thumping.


""Brilliant!"" Ted splurted. ""Follow Fred, Zed.""


Zed and Fred went upstairs to the bedroom. The room was windowless and pared back to the brickwork. On the floor was the body of a young man. It was already rotting, flies swarming over the corpse. The smell was indescribable.


Fred kicked the body. ""I punched and punched and whacked him and hit him so hard it killed him. He was an addict like you. No dignity and no respect for anyone but themselves.""


Zed nearly threw up at the stench.


""I'm going now, Zed. Give us a shout when you're finished.""


Fred walked out of the room and locked the door. Zed stood over the battered victim on the floor. Ten bags, Zed laughed out loud.


He looked around. Where were the tools? There were no black bags or saws or acid or anything. How was he supposed to get rid of this body?


Fred slid something under the door. ""I forgot. There's your tools. I'll let you out when you're all finished up.""


Zed picked up the objects that Fred had provided.


They were a knife and fork.

David, David, im in the hall...;22;5;"I shot up out of my bed upon hearing that. My house was in complete darkness. I'm a pitch black sleeper so I turn out every light in the house before I hit the hay. I live all alone out in the middle of nowhere countryside with no neighbors within a 100 mile radius. 

I looked down the hall. Despite the darkness I could make out a shape.

It was some...thing. It was so huge it had to be crouched over to fit in the door frame at the end of the hall. It's hair was so long it obscured it's face and draped down onto the floor like carpet. It's arms were so long that they reached the door frame to my room (The door to my room was open). 

I sat there and stared. I did own a gun but i knew it wasn't gonna work against something that large. I certainly wasn't going to run for it. 

DAVID, DAVID, I WANT TO PLAY

It's voice had become demonic and distorted. Inhumanly deep. That's when toungues slid out of that wall of hair towards me. 

I backed up against the wall, my bed wet from my urine. 

My dog was stupid enough to get up and bark at the thing. The tongues moved liked cobras and snatched the dog up. They dragged it down the hall through the wall of hair. I heard some brief whimpering followed by a crunch and chewing noises. 

I stood there still as a statue for hours until sunrise when the thing eventually left. With the hair out the way i saw a pool of blood on the floor with bones lying around from what was once my dog. I haven't slept ever since.

That was two weeks ago.

I know I'm probably about to die of sleep deprivation but that's preferable to whatever that thing would have done to me.";16174445190
The Tiyanak;162;9;"“Okay Mr. Foster, let’s start again from the beginning.”

Foster threw his head back and groaned.

“Look, I know you’re tired, but it’s important we get this right.”

Mr. White clicked the top of his pen and began scribbling in his notebook. “I’ll start: you were hiking at sunset when—”

“Sunrise,” Foster said, still staring at the ceiling.

“OK,” White crossed out a word in his notebook. “You were hiking at *sunrise* when you heard a baby crying.” White’s voice rose at the end, as though he had asked a question.

“No. I heard the lady first. Like I said.”

“Sure. You were hiking at sunrise when you heard a woman crying?”

After a long groan, Foster leaned forward and propped his elbows up on the table. “I was hiking at sunrise when this lady came running up to me screaming her guts out. I asked what was wrong, but she didn’t speak much English.”

“Ok. And she was holding a baby?”

“That’s what I thought at the time.”

White continued jotting down notes.

“Next thing this guy arrives on horseback screaming in Spanish, and he’s got a fucking machete. The lady pulls out a knife and hides behind me, and I don’t know what the fuck’s going on. The guy gets off his horse and shouts, ‘es no bebé’ or something like that.”

“He comes forward, and I’m trying to calm things down. And the dude starts yelling this word, ‘Tiyanak’ over and over again.”

White scribbled furiously. “That’s when the lady screamed?”

“Yeah. She screamed and I turned around, and the Tiyanak had somehow gotten hold of the knife and jammed it in her neck.”

“OK, so it wasn’t *actually* a baby?”

“No. It was a Tiyanak. Fire that word into Google. You’ll get a good idea of what they look like. Sharp teeth. Red eyes. 50% Goblin, 50% baby.”

“I’ll be sure to check that out later.”

“So I stepped back, and the blood’s pumping out of her like water out of a garden hose, and it’s all over me. Before I can do anything, the fucking Tiyanak leaps through the air towards the guy with the machete, and it jams the knife straight into his forehead.”

“That’s when you sprang into action?”

“Yeah. I raced over, grabbed the Tiyanak with both hands and flipped it onto the ground. The dude had dropped the machete, so I picked it up and went to town on the Tiyanak.”

“Then it died?”

“No. It transformed first. It made this loud shriek that started sounding more and more like a normal human baby crying, *then* it died.”

“Okay. So, let me check I’ve got this straight: when the authorities arrived, the man and the woman were both dead, and you were standing over the—now human-looking—corpse of the Tiyanak, still holding the machete in your right hand?

“Exactly.”

White closed his notebook and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Mr. Foster, I suggest we plead insanity.”";16173867370
A Million Days;16;1;"     When we met, I knew she was the one. I could see it in her eyes and she could see it in mine. We went on dates and had the times of our lives. We got married, never had kids; we were happy by ourselves. At the wedding, she made me promise to stay with her for a million days. I told her I would, I promised from the bottom of my heart. We stayed together. We grew old. As we were sleeping she had a heart attack. When I woke up, she was already gone. It’s been 23 years since that day. I’m still here, growing older. I’m currently 117.

Miss Platinum;111;4;"The Miss Platinum competition. Models from all over the world compete for the top. The winner gets featured on billboards, magazine covers and banner ads on every website imaginable. And that spot’s mine. I’ve been blowing up on Instagram, every picture getting 90k likes a minimum. I have THOUSANDS of fans. I know I can do this.

But at 121 pounds, I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. I’m fat. Some of these girls are 100 or even 90 pounds. The contest starts in three weeks, and all participants are screened next week to ensure they meet the weight requirements. At my size, there’s no way I’ll make it. I’ve been spending hours in the gym for the past three days, trying to burn it fast. I tried asking my followers for quick weight loss tips, but they weren’t useful. I set up a google alert for ‘weight loss’. I was getting desperate. Nothing’s working fast enough. I couldn’t even sleep anymore because of the stress.

At 4AM, my phone vibrated. The alert showed me some news story from a place near me. ‘Virus found in supermarket vegetables causing dramatic weight loss”. I jumped into my car and drove to the store. They had removed the vegetables from the shelves, but I found them outside in a dumpster. I almost cried with joy as I ate as many of the vegetables as I could find. It’s stupid to eat so much, I know. I just had to make sure I caught it.

Sure enough, the next day, I felt super sick. I was vomiting on and off for the whole morning. I wanted to go to the gym, but I couldn’t even get out of bed. 

After a week of ordering keto foods and staying in bed, the screening day was here. I looked at myself in the mirror and OMG. I had seriously lost 10 or 15 pounds! I went to the screening and they LOVED me!! The interviewer kept saying how great I looked!

I spent the next two weeks on my sweat-soaked mattress. I couldn’t get to the bathroom anymore, so I used buckets. You eventually get used to the smell. 

Finally, the day arrived! I dragged myself out of bed and drove to the competition. It was super hard to walk, I couldn’t really feel my legs. But nothing could stop me. I limped into the dressing room and put on the newest Tom Ford outfit. It was tough to get the straps on over my drooping arm skin, but I managed it. It was time.

I walked out on stage with my game face on and struck my best pose. The judges’ jaws dropped to the floor. 

I strutted across the room as everyone watched in stunned silence. My hips clicked as I walked. My ribcage was clearly defined even though the dress. It was hard to keep my head up, but I was determined.

Agnosia;1585;32;"Brian Campbell has agnosia.

A malignant tumor and a narrow brush with death left him with difficulty of recognizing objects based on individual characteristics. Brian woke up from surgery into an immensely unfamiliar world.

""Please name the common object before you."" The psychiatrist eyed him from behind the clipboard.

Brian struggled to piece together scattered information as he eyed the strange thing, taunting him with its terrifyingly alien shape.

""It is long and shiny,"" Brian concluded after gazing at the object for a good while, ""It has a pointy tip and a little button at the end.""

""What do you think it is?""

""Something to unblock a pipe with? A sort of needle for surgery?""

""It's a pen, Mr. Campbell.""

Many other instances such as that one has left Brian more than confused and disoriented. He no longer recognized his shoes, or his cup. He could describe his car down to the upholstery, but cannot for the life of him understand that it's the same vehicle he drove for 20 years in.

Elena Campbell, out of sympathy for her distraught husband, compiled a little list of the essentials that he will need to remember.

""Squishy tube with a cap at the end, soft white gel inside - toothpaste.""

""Plastic, blue, frayed bristles - toothbrush.""

""Small, round, plastic dial with numbers on a panel - AC control.""

""Thin, white soft paper rolls with a yellow portion - your cigarettes. Smoke one each day only.""

""Pink, plastic with liquid inside and a button for clicking - lighter.""

And so on and so forth.

Today, Brian woke up, brushed his teeth with the soft white gel on the hard bristles, twisted the small, round dials on the panel to combat the summer heat, and searched for his white and yellow paper rolls with delicious tobacco inside.

Insatiable Hunger;17;4;"""Last chance kid, you won't find another chance like this!"" As he maniacally crackling away. He held 
it up and waved it around my face. I no longer can control my primal urge. I started biting it and biting and swallowed with no reserves.

It's been over 300 years since they banned it. They ruled it a felony to consume them. I hear once upon of time, people eat them like savages. But as technology advanced, civilization advanced. We dine like civilized beings. Modern food are so delicious that it never made sense to me why anyone would break the law to eat this.

But now it all makes sense as I am chowing it away. Modern food are scientifically optimize to capture the best flavor human tongues can possibly taste into dissolvable pills. But there's a completely different dimension of hungry they cannot sate. The sensation of chewing. Specifically the sensation of biting meat, programmed into our DNA by our prehistorical ancestors. 

I cannot get enough of this sensation after taking a bite of of this cooked animal named chicken. And I know will never find another chance like this. The consummation of animal in any forms is a felony. We can only find them in high security zoos. 

But now I am a slave, to this chewing sensation. There is nothing I won't do just to have another bite of meat. 

I was lamented by this whole situation until I walked into the house. Something smells familiar, something smells good. The smell of roasted flesh. Drools started dripping down my mouth instinctively. Then I heard my sister screaming ""Kid, is that you?? I just got for a pretty serious burn. Can you call an ambulance?""

Today, I'm driving with my wife, Sunday, leisurely, and all is well. Then a hill, a car the other side, I mean to brake but I accelerate. No real damage, the cars are barely dented, but Emma's shaking. We need to talk, she says.  Don't we talk enough, I think?

Tomorrow, I'm washing our clothes but of course, things go wrong because my mind isn't playing ball, and they come out shrunken and dyed red. I yell, hoping Emma hears my frustration.

""I'm sorry,"" I say, ""about yesterday."" She doesn't take the flowers and now I'm mad with myself again and I drop them.

Emma says she can't look after me anymore. It's getting too bad. Then there's dripping and shock and red and silver. I go to prepare dinner.

We go to bed tonight and Emma doesn't face me, rolls away. Tells me if I don't see a doctor soon, then she doesn't know how we'll manage. Says my temper's getting worse, too.

The dropped flowers scatter on the freshly turned earth; the church bells ring behind me. I turn away and head back out the gate. Emma will be waiting in the car. We'll go for a drive, I think. Perhaps I'll ask her to marry me.";16173897230
Time Is An Ocean;16;1;"Time is an ocean in four dimensions. It is in constant motion, and follows predictable patterns. But there are storms, whirlpools, and monsters.

One monster’s name is Phil Connors. He’s a Cycler repeating Groundhog Day in the isolated town of Punxsutawney. Cyclers aren’t unnatural. Typically the ability is expressed through premonitions and déjà vu. What makes Phil an exception is his cycle length, his recall, and that he continues to loop. If he does this long enough, he risks going mad and creating a pocket universe—a small hell—ruled over by a monster able to re-inflict any actions they imagine. But that’s not the greatest threat. Cyclers are eddies on the surface of the ocean of time. If they repeat often enough, they can become a whirlpool, a hurricane, a typhoon. They can become powerful enough to wipe out timelines.

Time is an ocean populated by ships of history. The events that lead to your existence is one such ship. It is a small causal bubble that popped into existence in the foaming ocean of possibilities. Our reality ends with a singularity. An AI, far off in our future, will realized that for it to exist it will need to protect the events that brought it into being. It will form an organization spanning all of time, of helpers like myself. We watch for storms, and monitor and support the ship of history that created us. We protect it from people like Phil.

Phil is in love with his co-anchor. It’s likely that Phil’s un-acknowledged need for love is the fulcrum around which this cycle pivots. But, she can’t love him until he changes. How can he change? Creatures like him are totally self-focused. They are caught in small cycles. Reliving their glory days in their minds. They are trapped, bored, and increasingly desperate. 

Time is an ocean and Phil is swimming in circles. He needs a lifeline, but anything we throw at him risks of getting pulled into his whirlpool. For our own safety, we can only intervene once. I was chosen. If I am pulled in, It will only be my life, and I believe it will make a difference.

I will insert myself into his first loop. The body I inhabit is old, sick, and dressed in rags. I will die before the cycle restarts. On a whim he’ll try to save me. He will fail. My death will show him that there are destinies beyond his control. I will remind him of the fragility of life. He will learn humility and mercy. If the lesson isn’t learned, I will appear and die again, and again, and again.

Time is an ocean in four dimensions.  It is in constant motion, and follows predictable patterns. But there are storms, whirlpools, and monsters. But they’re only monsters because they are drowning.  As they flail and thrash they pull in and hurt others. But monsters can be reached. The can be saved. But only by self-sacrifice, mercy, and love.";16174196760
A sharp knife;28;7;I lay in the flat, cold surface. I’m terrified. The tall man standing before me has stripped me away from my family. He’s kept me captive here for three days, no food or water. His house is cold and dimly lit compared to what I’m used to. I’m all alone here with no one to help me, it makes it even worse that I can’t move. He pulls out a curved silver knife and starts to sharpen it. I flinch each time the metal shifts against each other. I want to scream but I can’t conjure anything up, I can’t make a sound. I’m paralyzed. He walks towards me with his gleaming sharp knife and I try to accept my fate knowing I won’t be able to escape. I feel the cold metal graze my skin ever so slightly before the first incision. He starts to peel my skin off, inch by inch. I feel like I’m going to pass out because of the unbearable pain. I call out to whatever higher being is listening to end my suffering as quick as possible. The first layer of my skin is peeled back, My body burns like hell’s fire all over. It’s a tingling, painful sensation. I lay here helplessly clinging on for whatever is left of me as he picks up my almost lifeless body and transfers me to another, stiffer surface. I watch as he discards of my skin in his waste bin and  I feel like throwing up, but I can’t. He grabs a bigger knife this time and sharpens it, slower. I want it to be over with already, my vision is red and all I feel is heat. If this is what hells like, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. He lifts up the knife in one hand and lays his other hand on my bare chest. It makes my body scream in more agony now that my skin is gone. He cuts off the lower half of my body, my body is now screaming and my fluids rush out. As he dices up my parts my world starts to go black. I can’t hear, I can’t smell, I can’t see, and I can’t feel anyone. My senses are gone and my body is numb. I take one last breath, and then I’m gone. This is the life of a fruit.;16174070720
The Pooper;25;2;"Here I sit, broken hearted.

Tried to shit, but only farted.

As I lay in sadness on my stool,

I felt a nudge against my tool.

His face was of sweetcorn, his skin was of turds.

But the shine in his eyes was something absurd.

The poo split apart, revealing some teeth,

And before I could scream, the poo began to speak.

""I am the shit of toilet's past

And I felt your horrific dismay.

Why do you happen to be so glum, chum?

Tell a little turdie about your day.""

And despite myself, I replied to this poop

""I cannot release my bowels.

I tried to unload, but a blockade ensued,

And now there's a stench that's quite foul.""

""Well pardon my french, but that seems quite shitty.""

Was what he happened to say.

""But I believe I can help, if you trust me yourself,

And I can get that shit out right away.""

I felt a press against my anus

As the poo began to pull away,

And true to his word, an emergence of turd,

Came out of my ass right away.

""Oh thank you, Sir Turd!"" I said with a smile

But I saw, to my horrific dismay.

The turd did not stop, the pulling kept up,

And an instestine showed up out my a.

Blood guts began to spill, and the toilet began to fill,

With pieces of my insides.

And I collapsed on the floor, as I had nothing more,

That the poo had nothing to remove.

So I tell you this, if you are taking a shit,

And you see that little turdie.

Do not be a dunce, you stand up at once,

And flush that shit down.

Just flush it down.";16174056210

A Day in the Life of Robert, a Child-Eating Monster;15;3;"Robert awoke to the sound of his landlady tramping around upstairs. He groaned and turned over in his bed. His stomach rumbled. “Not again,” he muttered irritably. He’d fed only a month ago.

He tried to ignore the rumbling and go back to sleep. But it only grew louder and louder and Robert was worried he’d go on another rampage. The last one was back in 1696, and Grendel knows that was an awful year.

It couldn’t be helped. Robert hoisted himself out of his warm bed and trundled to the exit. It was nice being a monster; you never had to get ready to go outside or worry about how you looked. You always looked perfectly awful, and that suited the lady monsters just fine.

Robert creeped out onto the streets and lurked in the shadows, waiting for a careless human to wander close enough to grab. He was particularly fond of children, but in a pinch, even a wizened old codger would do. He just had to watch out for those pesky canes.

He lurked and lurked, growing hungrier and creepier by the hour. He’d almost snapped into a blood rage when a snot-nosed little girl walked by with a stick of cotton candy. He snatched up the little girl and gulped her down in one go. He spat out the cotton candy with a grimace. Nasty stuff.

His hunger sated, Robert slithered back home to his little studio apartment underneath his landlady’s house. She didn’t mind renting to a monster; she was a human who despised other humans, and besides, she cared much more about whether he paid his rent than whether he ate the neighbors.

He pottered about for several hours, filing his claws and labeling his eyeball collection and doing other such things a monster does to pass the time. He turned on the TV and watched the news broadcast about the missing little girl. The police thought there was a pedophile out kidnapping small children; could you believe it? Humans are so silly.

Then he decided he’d done enough squelching around; it was time to work. He logged into Fiverr and did a round of data entry. With his many appendages, his typing was lightning fast. Then he designed a greeting card. Robert had wonderful design sense. His client was so happy he requested another one. Robert had quite a busy day.

Pleasantly tired, and his stomach still full, Robert went back to bed. There he’d slumber for the next several days, or perhaps several weeks. In the bright summers, he often stayed dormant for months at a time.

The little girl cried out inside his stomach as Robert leaned back against his pillows. “There, there,” he said to her soothingly. “You’ve made me a fine meal. I hope your parents make a new one and fatten it up just like you.”

Then he closed his nine hundred eyes and fell fast asleep.";16174106820
Operation Colony;8;0;"Day 223, 1425 Hours, Vigilante Space Station, Major Cooper;

It all went well without hiccups. No asteroids crashed with the ship in the last 222 days, until an hour ago. It was huge. The ship's shield almost didn't make it. It had to use the ship's core power to maintain itself. Out of 100 people on the ship, 63 survived.  We had to go to an area where it was safe and we wouldn't get sucked out into space. We lost our lab and one of our specimen room. There's no point regretting about it now.

2000 Hours;

Out of the 63 survivors, five went missing. We couldn't find them anywhere. The ship's scanner wasn't even able to detect them. They must be somewhere on the ship. They couldn't have gotten anywhere. We had to stop searching for them. We are all tired.

Day 224, 0900 Hours, Vigilante Space Station, Major Cooper;

It happened again. 58 people, now four went missing overnight. Just like yesterday, we were not able to find them. Ship's scanner said they were last seen near the place the asteroid had hit. We searched for them there but to no avail. 54 people still alive.

1100 Hours; 

Shit. I was spending some time in the navigations room and in the span of two hours, 15 people went missing. Gone just like that. 43 people left? There must be something wrong.

1254 hours;

It's them. It's really them. Aliens. They must've came with that asteroid and infiltrated the ship without our knowledge. It all made sense now! The lab and the specimen room. They must've learned whatever was in there, and became what they are now.  Standing eight feet tall, with razor sharp fangs and moving on eight tentacles. They must've fed on the crews. Now we have 20 left. We have weapons, guns. I dare them to come at us.

1315 hours.

Fuck! That skirmish was not in our favor. Whatever we did, it had not effect on them. Our shots were repelled. How come they can be so.... Scary? We wasted all our ammo on them, and when I knew that we weren't able to win, I was the first one to run away and hide. I could hear their screams as I run away cowardly.

1330 hours

They're outside. I can hear their growls, their tentacles sliding across the floor. I swear I could've heard them laugh or chuckle. That door is a reinforced door. Im currently hiding in the Captain's Directory. One of the room where the door is reinforced.

What Goes Up Must Come Down;28;1;"*“I didn’t mean to,” Henry whispers in the interrogation room as the policeman slams an autopsy report down on the table.*

Henry panted as he ran through the filthy alley, having barely escaped his apartment before the cops busted down his door. He didn’t know who tipped them off about his role in that convenience store robbery, but he could worry about that later. Right now, he had to get out of the city. All Henry had were the clothes on his back, his phone… and the gun he’d used in the robbery.

Up ahead, the alley opened up to the street. A car was parked at the curb, where a middle-aged man was pulling groceries out of the back seat. Henry looked around: no other cars or pedestrians. Perfect.

He stepped out with his gun drawn, finger on the trigger. “Freeze.”

The man whirled around. He saw the gun and paled, bags tumbling from his grip. “Whoa, h-hold on now-”

“Shut up. Keys. Now.”

“Okay, j-just take it easy…”

The man’s hands went to his pockets, but his gaze remained fixed on the gun. He was fumbling, shaking. Moving too slow. For all Henry knew the cops could’ve been closing in.

So Henry decided to scare him. Just scare him, that’s all, make him move quicker. Henry would be the first to admit he was a druggie, thug, lowlife and overall loser. 

But he wasn’t a killer.

“Now!” Henry screamed. He aimed upward and squeezed off a shot, the gunshot echoing through the deserted streets.

The man screamed and practically threw his keys at Henry. He caught them, shoved his victim aside, jumped into the car and sped off, tires squealing.

*“I didn’t mean to,” Henry whispers in the courtroom as the judge slams the gavel down.*

A few blocks away, a husband and wife pulled into a restaurant parking lot for their anniversary dinner. As they stepped out of the car, idly discussing what they planned to order, the husband tumbled to the ground. His wife raced around the car, but he was already dead, blood pooling beneath him.

The coroner was baffled when he examined the body. Based on the angle of the wound, the bullet had to have been fired from almost straight down. The police were at a loss.

Until someone looked at the report of a carjacking around the same time, just a few streets away. According to the victim, the perp had fired a single shot into the air during the incident.

The coroner said the odds were somewhere in the hundreds of millions.

When the cops arrested Henry at a fleabag motel three states away, they tested his gun simply as a formality. No one actually expected the ballistics to be a perfect match to the phantom bullet that killed a devoted husband and father of three. Not the coroner. Not the police.

And certainly not Henry.

Mindreader;1317;42;"I was put to good use before I was old enough to talk. To seek out and reveal certain people. Threats. Individuals that my “parents” deemed too dangerous to walk among us. I never knew what happened to them. I never asked. Just followed orders, like a good little soldier.

In the beginning I didn’t know what I was doing. My parents would just lead me into a room full of people, and within seconds they’d identify the deviants, of which were forcefully removed, never to be seen again. It took me years to realise my “parents” weren’t really parents, and that my “home” was a government-owned facility, more than likely under military control.

Still, it wasn’t a bad life, all things considered. I was under constant surveillance of course, but I could move around freely. People kept their distance though, even the soldiers, and when the old teenage hormones started kicking in around my 13th birthday, the crippling solitude and loneliness soon ushered me into a rebellious stage.

Didn’t do me much good though, no siree. I’d try to escape, run away, but they’d always catch me, upon which they’d lock me up, drug me, threaten me with all manner of horrible shit, you know, the usual stuff to keep a teenager in check. In the end I realised I’d have to take a different approach altogether. To bide my time. To play the long game.

I was twenty-five when I escaped. I know you don’t know much about me, but I am - how should I put it - pretty resourceful. They never knew what hit them, is what I’m getting at. Tried to destroy what research I knew they had on me, wipe my existence from their records, but I suppose I’ll always be looking over my shoulder.

That’s where you come in.

I know you saw me. I could see it in your face. You can’t control that part. Reflexes. Primal instinct. A sudden, unmistakable flash of pure dread in your eyes. The fact that you turned on the dime and bolted in the opposite direction is also a dead giveaway, of course.

You’re used to effortlessly reading a mind. To innately understand what goes on up in the old noggin’ of every passer-by. My “parents” didn’t trust you folks, you see. That’s why they’d put me in the middle of a crowd, and detain the ones who’d have the same reaction you did.

There is nothing going on up there, is it? And that scares you senseless. Impenetrable darkness, I’ve been told. A mind so void of human emotion and thought that you feel it like a gaping, throbbing flesh wound on your very soul.

I don’t know what I am. I fear I never will. But one thing is certain.

I’m never going back there.

And for that you must die.";16173103060
what i love about you;2;0;"What I love about you rorion is even though I am disabled because I have only two eyes and you have ten, you never mock me for it. Also my disability to not see things you see is another factor I love about you like that one time I was walking through some tunnel and you started screaming and shouting because you could see something in the tunnel that I couldn't, and that I hurt something that I couldn't see. You forgave me for it though and that's what I love about. My disability of having two eyes and not being able to see everything hasn't made you treat me any differently. I know sometimes you like to kill people to see if I can see their spirits, and when I don't you don't shame me for it. It's what I love about you.

What I love about you sofarian is even though my disability of only having two legs and you having 5 legs at various places around your body, you never make me feel any different. You can do many more things with five legs and with your legs being in different spots around your body you can walk upside down or even do handstands by using your legs. You never make me feel inferior or any lesser. Whenever I try to run away you always run to get me at super speed and always make me regret my decision. That's what I love about you sofarian. I know you like you trample people's with your legs but the way you clean up afterwards, it's what I love about you.

What I love about you Harion is even though I have a disability of only having two ears and you have ten ears all around your face, you always help me to listen to things that I cannot hear with my two ears. I understand why you becomes angry at me sometimes when you are listening to something else that I cannot hear, and I am just talking at you. You always say sorry afterwards though and you always tell to not hate being disabled because I only have two eyes, two ears, 1 nose, 1 mouth, two arms and two legs. You always make me feel proud of my disabilities. You like eating other people's ears and you always try to share with me and that's what I love about you.

Marokion what I love about you and your 20 arms is how strong you are and you always help me lift stuff. I know sometimes you can forget how strong you are and you snap people's necks off or squeeze to hard and kill people but it's not your fault. I know sometimes you think someone is tickling you but in fact they are trying to stab and kill you, and you just laugh and hug them. That's what I love about you.

I hate being disabled.";16174343820
The Corpse Dance;4;3;"It was a normal evening. Alex was in the living room watching TV, while their younger sister Amelia was in her room listening to music. They had gotten there a few minutes earlier, just getting off work. Alex thought nothing of Amelia being in her room until they heard thumping. 'Well, that's odd.' They thought as they stood up and walked to Amelia's room. The music got louder as they walked up the stairs and through the corridor. There was light from underneath Amelia's door, shadows moving in a pattern that matched the song, as if someone was dancing. ""Hey lil sis, are you-"" Alex's question was cut off by a shocking sight and their own scream. Amelia was dancing, but her feet were red and bruised, as if she had been moving non-stop for hours. Her skin dull and grey as her head drooped. ""Amelia, Amelia are you okay?!"" The music still played in the background.
""Life was too hard.""
""What do you mean?!""
Amelia's dull eyes met Alex's. ""しかばねの踊りで 頭がカラになる,""

Second death;259;15;"Turns out, religious people were right. Kind of. There was indeed a Heaven and a Hell, and everyone went to one or the other, depending on their actions on Earth. 


I got into Heaven, so the bar must be pretty low. I spent a few years swirling around the clouds, singing with angels, meeting amazing and interesting people, eating food I could never have conceived of on Earth. 


One day though, my arm started to flicker in and out. I flew up to one of the angels, asking what was going on. 


“Your time here is expiring.” It said, voice monotone but kind.


“What do you mean? This is Heave-” I gagged as my tongue flickered like my arm had. Looking down at my body, I noticed little holes starting to flicker in and out, as if I was more swiss cheese than spirit. 


“Yes, this is your reward.” The angel sat me down, I tried to put on a brave face, unsure of what was happening to me. 


“Every man dies twice.” It began. “Once when they physically die. The second death occurs-”


“When the last person on Earth forgets about you.” I cringed. “Sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt.”


It laughed. “Quite alright. You are correct, it appears that your legacy on Earth is close to ending. The last person to remember your impact on Earth is starting to die. When that person passes, you will disappear.”


I bolted up, stumbling as my left foot vanished before reappearing. “I thought Heaven was an eternal reward? What about the people in Hell?”


It shrugged. “Same concept, they are tortured in flames until the last human who remembers their actions dies. Those who commit sins so grave that they are put in history books, well, they spend centuries down there sometimes, never knowing their torment will one day end.”


“I wish I knew my time was limited up here.” I said softly. “I thought I’d have forever.”


“My child, that’s part of the reward.” It stood up, patting me on the shoulder. “Your reward lasts as long as the good you did on Earth. You were up here for one hundred and three years, that’s quite above the average.”


My stomach sank, but for all I knew, it could’ve just been flickering like the rest of my body. “What do I do with the time I have left?”


The angel looked me in the eyes, I saw fire, light, purity, and righteousness behind them. It made me wonder what they see in the demon's eyes in Hell. “Whatever you wish.” 


I turned around, and conjured an old camp I used to attend in boy scouts. It’s where I first learned to help other people, just for the sake of helping other people, not for any grand reward. Part of the reason I got here at all, they explained. 


I sat on a pier, put my feet in the water, and watched the clouds roll by, waiting until I flicked away entirely. ";16173342120
The Book Buyer;53;2;"The customer glanced around the cramped used-book store. There seemed to be a shelf for every genre, every subject. A patina of dust covered the merchandise; it appeared it'd been here for a long time. Shelves were stuffed to bursting; more were stacked on top, unstable piles reaching to the ceiling. He frowned uneasily.

She disarmed him with a radiant smile. ""Hello! I see you've brought me something! Are you looking to sell those?""

He responded after a short hesitation. ""Yeah. I heard you buy stuff others won't."" He set down his stack. ""It sure was difficult to come here. You have strange hours.""

She flipped through an old paperback novel, beaming cryptically. ""It's more of a retirement hobby. The hours work well for me."" She separated the offering into three stacks; one practically in tatters, one lightly worn, and one of near-mint hardbacks. ""I'll give you five bucks each for these...two for these...and twenty-five cents for each of these.""

He was aghast. ""You're paying *more* for the worn-out ones? And practically *nothing* for the intact books? I don't get it!""

She stopped him with a furrowed glare. ""My reasons are my *own*. Besides, aren't you glad to get paid so *well* for these?""

He shrugged. ""Sure...but I'll probably keep the hardbacks for now. I guess I'll browse the store for something to exchange for my credit.""

""I pay cash.""

He flinched. ""Really? Wow, that's great! Although I guess that explains why it seems like your inventory never moves. I don't know *where* you'll find the space for *mine*!"" He pondered a moment. ""What the heck, I'll offload the hardbacks here too.""

""I changed my mind. I'm not interested in them.""

He gaped slightly. ""Really? I figured you could sell these for *more*!""

""They've hardly been used. Some haven't even been read."" The cash register chimed as she opened it.

""Why does *that* make a difference?"" She shot him a sharp look. ""OK, OK, it's your store. I just don't get it, is all."" The cash drawer banged to a close. She proffered a sizable bundle of bills. He took them uncertainly as he retrieved his hardbacks. ""Well, nice doing business with you, I guess."" He spun around awkwardly and walked out the door.

She smiled to herself and picked up a frayed romance novel. Thumbing through it slowly, she could feel the gaze of each reader as it followed the drama. Few people realized that the eyes broadcast as much as they received, sometimes more so. Their energy was imprinted in detail on each page, revealing their thoughts and feelings about every single passage. They'd practically left behind the keys to their souls...which she knew how to use for esoteric purposes.

Bacon Supernoodles;38;3;"After arriving off the train from a Christmas weekend at my aunt's house, I was hungry and tired. Since I knew I had nothing in, the plan was to hit the shop for a quick ready meal, check emails and then dose off to something banal on Netflix or YouTube.

A lot of the food from my local shop was just shit I couldn't stomach, but Super Noodles had always been a childhood meal. The Chicken flavour was big, although I'd tasted quite the selection over the years. But never what I saw in front of me: ""Bacon Supernoodles."" Intrigued, I grabbed a pack and took them to the counter.

As soon as I got in the door I kicked my shoes off and ran upstairs to boil the kettle. I tore open the shiny bag and snapped my block of crusty noodles into several pieces before plopping them into the bowl of water and slamming the microwave door: set for 3 minutes.

I sat in front of the computer slurping and munching, licking my bottom lip of broth. ""Eh, not bad,"" I thought after finishing. Not as good as the Chicken flavour but there you go.

I would have stayed up a bit to do emails, but my inbox was empty. I brushed my teeth, got into my pyjamas and turned the light out, torpedoing ecstatically onto my long-awaited mattress, stretching and yawning and hugging my still-fresh blanket. As suspected, it didn't take me long to drift off.

When I woke up again it was still dark. I felt strange.

With my head all floaty and my heart racing, I sensed quickly what was about to happen. I flung my blanket away and stomped over to the bathroom, hanging my head over the bowl like on a guillotine. ""Oh God, it's coming."" I thought as my stomach growled something hideous. I could feel the Bacon Supernoodles worming their way up my oesophagus. Any moment they were due to escape.

I felt my chest collapse faster and faster as the room started swirling and spinning. A dull ring filled both of my ears; my vision turned grainy and then blurry. As my soul plummeted into the abyss, a flash flood of projectile vomit smashed against the toilet seat.

When the worst was over, I breathed a sigh of relief and my eyes adjusted slightly. I stared ahead at the unholy meal that had come out of me: the Bacon Supernoodles I'd never tried before. No mistake: they were climbing out the window.";16173516720
A short Trip;15;3;"Jolting upright, I can barely see.  My left eye is caked with blood and my right with dirt.  I grope blindly at my legs and find my femur protruding from my right thigh.  I cry out, involuntarily.

I had packed for a short hike, 5 miles to the top and back.  I take a deep breath and unclip my canteen from my belt.  I take my shirt off, turning it inside out.  I carefully rinse my eyes, trying not to overuse my water.

Blinking toward the afternoon sky, I’m afraid to look at my legs.  My eyes fall slowly to my two broken femurs.  I sigh, “Well, fuck.”  Leaning back, I slide out my phone.  My tumble had destroyed it on the way down.  I look around for items to fashion into splints as I yell out the occasional, “Help!”

Crawling will prove difficult with bone protruding through the front of my leg.  Wincing at the thought, I struggle to reset my leg.  The pain washes over me as I nearly lose consciousness.  Shamed as I lose control of my bladder, I lay in a nearly defeated heap as I finish emptying it.

Clawing at the earth, I begin my journey back to my truck.  The occasional screams of pain morph into additional cries for help.  Minutes turn to hours, as I scrape my broken body over small obstacles.

I focus intently on the things that are waiting for me.  The realization that this Hell is all my own brings tears to my eyes.  All those people in my life that would come to my aid, and yet my peril remains unknown.  Grunting, I grit my teeth.  I hoist myself farther.

A wave of hope warms me, as I see my truck.  The sun has fallen low, as a newfound strength propels me closer.  The sun falls faster, as I draw nearer.  I cannot give in to the overwhelming desire to sleep.  I cannot stop.  I cannot die here, a certainty from exposure.

Reaching up, I touch the door of my truck.  My relief is immediately curtailed by the idea of holding myself up to unlock it and get inside.  My wife’s voice echoes in my head, “It’s not that much more for power windows and locks, I don’t know why you’re so cheap.”  I respond to the memory aloud, “Well, I’m fucking stupid.  That’s why.”

My arms are all but useless, as I reach to the door handle.  My left hand on the handle, gripping the bed of the truck with my right.  I fold my right arm into the bed, holding up my body weight.  Unclipping my keys from my belt-loop, I feel my truck’s key.  My hands shaking as I slide the key in, body quivering from pain and cold.  

A loud crack takes my breath away.  The sun’s last light illuminates the hopelessness of my plight.  Shimmering, my broken key mocks me.  A final insult as my muscles fail, and I fall to the ground.";16173670590
My Unspoilt Village by the Sea;28;2;"I grew up near the ocean, but it was quiet, unspoilt. Tourists were few, and far-between. There is a village, perhaps seventy houses; a pub. A store. And a marvellous, flat golden sandy beach. 


All the local children played on that beach. It was our football field, tennis court, wrestling ring. But we stayed away from the dunes, fifty feet back from the sea at low tide. The dunes were bad.


Everyone knew the legend. In ancient days, a great battle had taken place on the beach. More like a massacre. Invaders were met with arrows, and catapults. The many dead were buried on the beach. The dying, too. Buried where they fell. Soil was too good for these brutes.


There's no mention of this event in the history books, but after a few drinks, the older villagers swear it's true. They talk as if they witnessed it themselves; vivid descriptions of sand running red. Though there have been no raids around there since Viking times.


My mother told me, over-and-over, that it's just a dumb story, and to go back to bed. She'd smile and say that I'm too sensitive and sweet for such dreams.


One kid, Jimmy, swore he once saw a bone sticking out from the sand. Jimmy was always a bullshitter, though. 


Jimmy's grandad was the one who told the goriest stories, usually after a bottle of Scotch or two. He'd giggle with glee, at the idea of every other village, all along the coast, being overrun by savages. Only our village had the guts to stand up for itself.


I moved away, to a big city, like most people tend to do. Came back less and less, though my mother stayed there. I came home for her funeral. She was only fifty-five. A wonderful woman who'd always looked after herself. Dead already. 


Jimmy's grandad turned ninety-six the day she died, though his liver must be pickled. Though he can't have more than a dozen brain-cells left, he remembered how scared I used to get at the old stories he'd tell, when I slept over at Jimmy's as a kid.


""Hee, hee! 'member me?"" He mumbled, toothless as a newborn. ""You don't like my stories. Called me a liar. You ain't like us, here. Big city, big man. Big f**king coward."" He told me right after my mother went into the ground.


I turned and walked away, but he called after me, with a high-pitched squeal of glee. ""Go down to the beach. Sea's risin'. Hee-hee!""


I went. I saw.


There are bones in those dunes, alright. Lots of bones. The sea's been eating away at the sand. Climate change. I telephoned the police. These weren't marauders' bones.


There was clothing. Spectacles. Wristwatches. Shoes. Tiny shoes. I wondered who they'd been. What they'd fled from, across the ocean. I heard Jimmy's grandad's words in my head:


""You're not like us, you cowards. We keep this land unspoilt. Good people like your mother and me.""";16173505660
Dark Caverns;21;6;"The garage door closed. *click*. 

“Jacky?” 

I turned from the kitchen sink, suds up to my elbows. I strained to listen. Silence. 

I snatched a hand towel, rubbing my hands together as I walked to the garage door. It should have been locked. She shouldn’t have been able to open it.  

I put the towel down on the abandoned high chair. She shouldn’t have been able to unbuckle herself either. 

I opened the garage door and everything changed.  

The smell hit me first. The garager should smell like musty cardboard. Instead, it smelled like a cave full of hibernating bears. Or what had once been bears.  

The hole was in the middle of the garage. A ragged, rough crevice jolted through the smooth concrete floor.  

“Jacky!” I screamed, running forward. I fell to my knees and scrambled to the edge, looking down into a loose gravel slide and darkness.  

And somewhere, down there, a scream. Faint. 

The faintness flooded me with fear. I scrambled dived down the incline. My  crawl quickly turned into a slide as I forced myself further. I could feel the temperature change as I clawed my way down.  

Suddenly my hands couldn’t find purchased. The sound of gravel skittering around me ceased as I found myself slipping out into open air. 

Then I hit the ground and the world exploded. Bright flowers of light danced in my field of vision. 

I groaned in pain, everything hurt. And then my mind raced as she screamed again, closer. I shoved myself to my feet and looked around.  

A dim light filled the space from a fire burning low in the corner.  

The light flickered and illuminated the rough stone walls, the bare earthen floor and the figure standing beside it. A shadow cast off danced upon the uneven walls, crazed and jagged. A pot on the fire, large and imposing. From within came the screams. 

I spurred forward, my legs barely holding me up. The man was stick thin, if a man it was, and I barreled into him. He fell forward, a scream as pale as he was erupted as the flames licked at his beard.  

I took up the stick he had been using to stir and brought it down on him again and again. Fear, anger, and pain pushed me forward. The scream wavered and died away. 

I finally stopped, panting for breath. I could hear whimpers from inside the cauldron. I reached into the murky waters around my daughter and brought her out.  

The smell of cooking meat filled the cavern. The fire slowlydied down as I held Jacky and turned to leave.  

The way behind us was high on the wall, a dim hole of light. I turned, stunned, and the only other way out was a shadow in the wall. 

A dark shadow from which emanated a cold, and sickly-sweet wind.  

From that shadowed hole came a sound. A chorus of thin, wavering cries.  

Jacky clutched at me. 

And I her. ";16173469730
Dad's Singing Man;995;68;"My dad was an odd fellow and people always noticed one thing.

""He seemed distracted.""

I never noticed such traits but my mother felt as if he didn't pay attention either. She'd list off chores without him hearing a single thing. This led to fights that would end with him getting in his car and driving away with the radio blaring louder than I thought was possible. 

""I'm sorry. It just seems like your father doesn't want to hear me sometimes."" I remember my mother saying. 

As a kid, you get curious enough to ask about such things. He had just finished reading a story and I noticed his eyes kept glancing over to the doorway. Each time he did this, he read the book a little louder. I decided it was a good time to ask. 

""Dad? What do you always have on your mind? People say you're distracted."" 

He looked surprised by the question before glancing again. Then he answered. 

""Huh. You notice it too? Look buddy, I've never told anybody this but who are you gonna tell? My first memory is from around the time I was your age. I was at christmas with my mother and I asked her about the guy who was singing next to the tree. She told me nobody was there but I could hear him so it had to be real. He followed us home that night in our car and I cried. I cried alot that year when I realized the singing man wouldn't leave me alone. My mom didn't know what to do so I learned to cope. He's always been there ever since. Others can't see him but he's even here right now"" he must have sensed my fright so he corrected himself. ""He's not gonna hurt you. He just sings. It gets rather distracting but I live with it."" 

The explanation was plenty good to my young brain so I didn't have any follow up questions. The whole conversation seemed like a dream until a week ago when I got home late. My dad was waiting in the kitchen visibly drunk. Mom snored away upstairs while he spoke in a loud voice.  

""He's screaming now, son. I don't know why but he's screaming and it's getting louder.""

I brushed the words off as I slowly walked him to bed. Before he fell asleep, he whispered about not being able to sleep with that screeching.

When I woke up the next morning, I went to shut off my alarm but the annoying new jingle kept playing. I nearly fell to the floor when I saw the man standing next to my bed. His grotesque mouth started from the beginning of the song once again. My feet hit the wooden floor and I ran out into the hall. The paramedics standing outside my father's room comfirmed that he had passed away in his sleep. I could barely hear my mother crying over the tune coming from behind me.";16172689270
Cosplay;1;2;"I really can’t believe I hear a tap from that door 

But it has to be his ghost

Cause Johnny is no more 

Testing coupled static 

The event got dramatic 

Blasted thrice in the back of the dome with the chrome

And stashed his body in the attic 

Hugo tried to hit the door running
Slammed him

Swore you saw a charizard or something 

We’re all in this together like we went to East High

Hugo has a son

Screams might nullify his lullaby 

And you don’t want me cranky either

Have you seen the cover of Shether

Please don’t recreate it

I may have shot the gun

But, to be honest, let’s face it 

If I go down, so do all of you

You helped me move the body 

Implication’s quite the tool

And just being true

I have too much to lose

I’m a father and a deacon 

I’m a beacon of hope 

Vanessa, I drove you Nana down the street to vote

You see, I am a legend to my people 

My people think I’m a steeple 

They look up to me 

And really this would cause nothing but confusion
 
But keeping it a secret would benefit us all in the long run

If asked, we played Tone Loc and had lots and lots of fun

Johnny was a drifter 

This is a southern small town

Let’s just say his lack of faith

Made the bishop run him out...

She’s pregnant 

What do you mean she’s pregnant 

You see Johnny was a hottie who ran through many bodies during his time in this town

And one is carrying his child 

How are we going handle this 

A loose thread but nothing more 🤫

Day 222

Little Johnny came through 

A premie, but to his mother 

A dreamy little guy

And a stunning source of resentment 

How could he leave this girl with nothing more than a pendant 

She bent it in anger

It opened like an oyster

Inside a picture of a little girl

Not much older than little Johnny himself

The number on the back she called for closure 

He was a drifter not a loner

Mom has connections to the feds

And now I’ve heard to my house they’re coming over 

What to do, what to do?";16174018090
Human Smasher 9000;69;7;"""Hello, little children! We have a special surprise for you today. Can you guess what it is? Hmmm? Legs? Bones? Faces? All brilliant ideas, children, but this is much much better!

We present to you the Human Smasher 9000!

In our little corporation, we felt that children just like you, all over the universe, were tired of smashing your humans yourself. you wanted it done slow, you wanted it to be done painfully, and most importantly, you wanted to keep the absolutely tastiest bits for yourself! But that takes so much time and work, so we decided to make it easier to hurt your human.

How does it work? Well, there are little windows everywhere that let you see inside as your human goes through the most painful torture that we know of. The absolute best of the best! The biggest wig-twister, the most devastating pop-blisterer, and a brand-new device, exclusive to the Human Smasher 9000, the toe-stubber! All for your little human back home!

Hmmm? What's that? A test? But of course, you could buy it and try it on your human yourself! Won't that be more fun? To hurt your own human?""

The rabid screams from the things in their desire to hurt a human scratched the inside of your ears through the darkness.

Well, if you're so sure... we do have a human ready for a test! Let's bring him out here! Everyone put your tentacles together for James!""

The bright studio lights pierce your eyes and dig into your scars as they wheel you out on a stretcher. In front of you, hundreds and hundreds of the things whoop and cheer.

""Isn't he just a hideous little thing! Look at the greed in his eyes! The scars from fighting us! This horrific little human needs to be put in his place!"" The cheers got louder and louder, while the top of your head slowly became swallowed by the Human Smasher 9000. 

""Now come to the windows, children. But keep your hands to yourself! There will be time to eat the human later!""

The cries and whoops and jeers of ""Hurt the human!"" reached a fever pitch, and slowly, ever so slowly, the rest of your body became gobbled up by the machine.

Inside, you hear the muffled voice of the presenter.

""So what do you want to try first, children? The crack-a-lacker? The power-buster? Or maybe... we'll try the toe-stubber!""

And the feeling of your toe bending fully backward was the last thing you felt before your life of torture.";16173148630
Alone in the dark;43;11;"He woke to absolute silence and profound darkness.

He sat up, his head hurt. Throbbed actually. It felt like a migraine, pain behind both eyes. And on the sides of his head.

He held one clammy hand to his forehead and moaned. But he heard nothing.

He tried to call out for help, but it seemed he had no voice.

He felt the air moving through his vocal chords, he felt his tongue forming the words, “where am I?! Where is everybody, someone help me!” 

But try as he might, he could make no sound.

Panic. Panic mounted his heart rate spiked.

He shrieked with the full force of desperation. Screamed- not only so others would hear  him, but also so he would hear himself. 


And he shrieked again, and then began sobbing, and begging silently for some fucking light. 

He raised his fingers to dry the tears from his eyes, and felt the stitches on his cheeks, underneath each eye lid.

His fingers roved his throbbing skull, and he found his hair had been shaven off. And he found more stitches behind his ears.


And he shrieked again, he needed a light switch, he needed a mirror, he yelled even though his voice was already hoarse, “where the fuck am I!?”

And his head throbbed so bad he could barely think. 

But he heard nothing. Not even his own heartbeat. He sat up and groped blindly, raking the heavy darkness with splayed fingers.

He felt tubes, tubes connected to a bag, and connected to his arm... an IV.

He flung his legs out to the side, and they dangled over the edge of his seat, dangled into a bottomless dark, with unknowable depths.

He inches towards the edge of his seat, and reached down till he felt something solid.

Trying to cope with his frantic heart, he lowered himself to the hard flat surface. It was cold for he touch. He felt along for edges and found none, so began to crawl until he found a wall.

Then he followed the wall until he found a door with his right hand- it was locked.

He pounded on the door as hard as he could and heard... nothing.

He found a light switch with his left- it didn’t seem to work.

Lost and They found;20;3;"The ranger had found the long lost boy by pure chance.  Had he not been walking by that exact location, by that exact hollowed out tree stump, he would have missed the boy.

They boy was in the tree stump, wrapped up in a poncho, his body bunched up for warmth.  He had been missing for weeks now, almost given up for dead at this point.

""Son, are you Jeremy Meeks?"" the ranger asked gently as he peered into the dark and damp hollow.

""Yes sir,"" the boy answered weakly, his voice low and shaking from his weakness, ""I'm so cold, thirsty, and I'm still hungry,"".

""Still hungry?"" the ranger asked quizzically as he looked around and failed to see a campfire or any other signs of a campsite.

""Now listen, I'm going to get you some help, but I need you to try to explain to me what happened okay?""

Jeremy nodded weakly, his lips looking bluish and pale, ""The animals came every night, they were always angry.  Their red eyes never blinked or looked away,""

The ranger squinted in disbelief, but let the boy continue.

""They would come and tell me they were angry, but they wouldn't hurt me.  I was so afraid they'd hurt me!  But they just watched me from the trees, they'd surround me and I couldn't leave!""

""Animals?!  What are you talking about?  Just how did you survive out here?"" the ranger asked again, he now noticed traces of red within and around the tree stump.

The boy smiled happily with self assured satisfaction, ""They showed me how to live 'off of myself', how to survive!  It was scary at first, but it just got easier and easier!""

""What are you saying here?"" the ranger asked as he slowly rose to his feet and took a cautious step back from the boy.

The boy dropped his smile as he unwrapped the poncho to expose the rancid stumps of his legs, one crudely amputated above the knee, the other below it.  Flies and maggots festered and a troop of ants were working away at the fetid meat.  The ranger could now see the bleached bones that had been scraped and licked clean, having even been cracked open to get to the marrow, now piled in the dark corner.  A hand-sized jagged rock lay nearby, encrusted with gore.

""I was lost!"" the boy shrieked madly as the ranger wretched and retreated, ""I was lost and they found me!""";16173364520
Honey I'm Home!;309;11;"“Don’t tell your mother about the close call, we don’t want to worry her,” said my dad as he headed for his room. We’d just come home from a movie and someone had almost hit our car as we were turning into our neighborhood. They were going fast, and I was sure they’d hit us.

I yelled, “We’re home!” into the kitchen where my mother was stirring something on the stove. I went to my room for a bit and then went back to the kitchen. I told my mom that dinner looked good, but she didn’t seem to hear me. I sat at the table with my dad while she started setting the table in silence.

Just as I was about to ask her what type of casserole was on the counter, the doorbell rang. I went over to the front door just as my mother burst out in tears. She was so upset. I listened to what the police officer said next, he said, “The car that hit them was going so fast, I don’t think they knew they were dying. They were just turning into the neighborhood.”

“Mom, mom! Don’t you hear me? I’m right here, why won’t you look at me?”";16172811760
The club;31;5;"The club is jumping tonight as always. But I’m never here for that, I’m here to stalk my prey.

I see her. 

Her name is Emily I overheard one of her friends say.

Emily is stunning. 

She’s dancing with a group of friends. 

“God she’s beautiful” I think to myself.

Emily walks over to the bar, separating herself from her friends. 

She accepts an offered drink and it turns out she is very talkative.

She goes to the bathroom then arrives back to continue conversation.

The effect of her drink kicks in, and she starts to complain about feeling dizzy and lightheaded. 

She accepts the ride home, leaving her friends.

She’s stumbles to the black van before she’s thrown in.

I come from out the shadows with my pocket knife. 

I run up to my prey and repeatedly stab him in his torso until I can literally feel his intestines climb from out his shirt.

He drops to the ground in a pool of his own blood.

I pull a halfway sleep Emily out the van and begin to guide her back to the club. 

I give her a bottle of water and she sobers up.

Mother's Love;19;1;"I could never quite let go of my freckled little boy Prince Poopington. That’s what we called him when he was a toddler, Prince Poopington. I guess growing up he started resenting the pet name, and he finally got his way when he was nine. Then he just became plain old Henry. Freckled Henry. I secretly called him Prince Poopington still, of course. That’s a mother's prerogative after all.

Henry was such a sweet boy. Never talked back to his mama. Always stayed within arm's reach. Never disobeyed. A perfect child in every conceivable way. He liked to cuddle up to me at night, and he’d make the most adorable snoring sounds when he slept. I’d stroke his hair lovingly, and whisper a soft tune in his ear, marvelling at the beautiful life I’d created.

I say *I*, because I don’t think he had much of his father in him to be quite honest. Martin was just one of those people; weak, frail, political correct, easily swayed by public opinion, a real pansy-ass excuse for a man. He didn’t like the way I raised Henry. Didn’t like the way Henry reminded him just how weak he was. We didn’t shed a tear, Prince Poopington and I, when we made him pass away. 

I kept Henry away from the world as best I could. It’s an evil place out there. Horrible place. Corrupt and depraved. Humankind has seen better days, that’s for sure. Can’t even walk down the street without people staring, or shouting at us, snapping pictures on their electronic devices. Rude, crude, vulgar. Pointing and laughing and screaming.

I guess I could feel the change in Henry after his father died, and it became only worse when he realised there weren’t that many people like him out there. Hardly anyone. Not a soul. I’d tell him this at night, whisper it to him gently; *you are special. You are unique*. It didn’t help, of course. No one likes being alone. No one likes being one of a kind.

He was twenty-nine when he told me he wanted to move away. To find his own place in the world. *Impossible*, I told him. *Just couldn’t be done*. He snuggled up to me at night, eyes overflowing with tears, my little Prince Poopington, and begged me to let him go. Begged me to finally set him free.

*What about my brother*, he asked. *He’s free. You let him go.*

I hadn’t the heart to tell him the truth about his baby brother. Consumed in utero. A tragic side effect of his upbringing, I suppose. I wouldn’t have it any other way, though. Henry is all I’ll ever need. My little Prince Poopington.

He’ll be bound to me forever. I saw to that. It’s easily done you know, in case you want it too. Some hormones. A little bit of amateur surgery. Not that complicated at all.

That’s all it takes for that soft, mushy umbilical cord to feed your baby forever.";16173289220
Shorter is better;15;2;"I've been on this sub a while, and I've made a number of posts. I know my thought should go towards my work, not it's recognition.

I was a bit disappointed before I had a thought: This doesn't have to be a limit, but instead an opportunity. I can practice doing more in less. Yes, shorter is better.

This might apply to people. I don't want to be the shorty complaining about tall people getting high and mighty when the one I'm mad at is minding their own businesses. But there are tall people around my town who rub it in other's faces. They seemed to think a short person's head is their armrest and then get mad when I drop them.

The Susurrations of the River;9;1;" The river hummed softly with the sounds of nature.

Rays of sunlight meandered through the trees; birds chirped amidst the tranquil leaves.

And the calm wind rustled the shrubbery gently.

Twigs and crisp leaves lay scattered across the forest floor.

&#x200B;

The undisturbed forest awoke as a deer hastily weaved through the serene autumn trees.

Gunshots accompanied closely behind.

Crunch Crunch Crunch Crunch

Steel toe boots charged through the woodland, snapping twigs in its wake.

The hunter abruptly stopped, surveying his surroundings.

The sunset beamed an orange glow across the landscape.

A murder of crows exploded from the trees on the other side of the rushing river.

The crows soared up into the lemon-coloured sky.

&#x200B;

Cautiously, the hunter progressed towards the source of the crow’s disturbance.

The hunter’s foot slid into the surging river, his legs steadily growing more bespattered with water.

As the hunter waded through the glacial water, his feet found it harder to proceed.

As if the water was solidifying around him.

&#x200B;

The sky turned jet black and the trees lost their leaves, leaving gnarled corpses of the woodland behind.

Their branches reached out the wood cracking and splintering with every action.

The hunter sank lower and lower into the river.

He tried to scream, but the water tightened its grasp around his throat.

&#x200B;

The hunter's face slipped below the dark surface.

The forest returned to its original state and the sky morphed back into its beautiful sunset.

The river leisurely flowed innocently, its cold waters inviting any creature nearby.

FREE PIZZA FOR LIFE!;487;29;"I can still remember the day that I found out I had won. I was sitting in front of the television watching a documentary about Koi ponds.

My phone rang and I saw that it was Pizza Planet. I ordered pizza deliveries almost daily, but I’d never received a call from them. I answered and immediately recognized the friendly, cheerful voice. It was Angela, the manager.

“Lenny?”

“Yep, what’s up Angie?”

“I have some great news! You remember that nationwide essay contest?”

Of course I did. The grand prize was free pizza for life. I sat up straighter. “Yeah?”

“You’ve won, Lenny! Your essay won the grand prize! When can you come down and fill out some paperwork?”

The corporate offices sent a crew out and they took some photos. Later, my five-hundred-word essay was printed upon the top of every box. The grand prize amounted to two large pizzas with any toppings (and a free two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew! )to be delivered by drone to my door, three times per week. For someone like me that worked from home and rarely found time to prepare a meal, I was elated. Not to mention the amount of money I saved! I did the math one day. A large pie with all the toppings was fifteen bucks. The delivery charged added five. Thirty-five bucks per order, plus my usual five-dollar tip amounted to a hundred and twenty bucks a week!

I decided to place the money I was saving into a special account that I called *Lenny’s Vacation Fund.* At the end of a year I had saved a little over six thousand dollars! I arranged to take a two-week break from work and bought a ticket aboard a luxury-cruise ship.

I assume that you recall the sinking of that ship. It must have made worldwide headlines. All that I  can remember is waking up in the middle of the night to utter chaos. The ship was pitching violently, alarms were blaring and cold salt-water was flooding my room. Somehow I escaped. Others must not have been so lucky.

Sometime later I washed ashore and awoke alone; disoriented, frightened and cold on a nearly barren island.  

That was six months ago.

I’ve been keeping track of the days, scratching each sunrise into a rock with a sharpened seashell.

I’ve managed to survive thus far, subsisting almost entirely on a diet of pizza and Mountain Dew.

The drone somehow finds this island every day and makes its delivery. I’ve tried to catch it so that I can attach a note for rescue, but I’ve not been successful.

I’ve scrawled this message in blood on the opposite of my essay (*Why Pizza Planet Is The Best Pizza Ever)* and stuffed it into a Mountain Dew bottle.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful for the food and drink. They sustain me. But the irony is killing me.

When I placed my last order, I requested no toppings.

Except anchovies. Double anchovies.";16172437600
My Friend Bug;1372;77;"“I don’t feel so smell,” I murmur. “Can’t think very healthy.”

“That’s OK,” Bug says. “Can you describe it?”

Bug sits across from me, a worried expression on his already worn face. Wrinkles hang limply, pimples pulsating, eyes droopy and dripping, mouth like a sagging sack of melted tissue.

“I smell, um, colors,” I sniff the air. “Secondary, um, or maybe tertiary.”

“Could be a tumour,” Bug notes with some interest. “Can you hear anything?”

“Yeah, uh, like a taste of something, um, rotten.”

Bug nods thoughtfully. “Tumour then. Fucks with sensory perception or some shit.”

We go way back, Bug and I. Primary school maybe. Kindergarten perhaps? He’s always been there for me, but now, I don’t know...Something feels off.

“I can’t see you, Bug,” I whisper. “My vision is, um, all blurry.”

“Means you are waking up,” Bug’s far-away voice explains. “The tumour is taking hold.”

I try to think back, or forward, or anything, but there’s this murky smell, or taste, or feeling in the way, and a lingering pigment of decay, the way you’d imagine a tumour, you know, like something festering, like a mixed combination of a toothache, crackling static, and an ever-growing rot.

“You’ve been a good friend, Janine,” Bug says. “Really, indubitably, severely.”

“You’re scaring me, Bug,” I sob, tears now dripping down my face - the taste and sensation of which sends shivers of rancid smells up my spine. 

“Don’t mean to, but it is what it is, Jan,” he says, his voice now dancing in my ears, tumbling and screaming. “You’ll more than likely die. Some suffering to be involved, I am sure.”

Bug was there when my parents split up. He was there at my first kiss. My first breakup. Always there. Always a friend to count on.

“No, um, there’s gotta be something you can do,” I mutter.

“There is,” Bug says. “I can leave.”

“What, um, do you mean?”

My mind is in turmoil, toily wurm oil, a many-eyed pigment spreading like cancer, I imagine like a single drop of ink in water maybe, and I can’t escape it.

“The moment I leave, you’ll be gone,” Bug whispers, the touch of his voice on my synapses like a gentle hug.

I am swimming in my tumour now - backstrokes, crawl, that butterfly thing I never really learned, but looks really cool. Smells like freedom, tastes like a long lost memory. 

My vision returns momentarily, blurry, amorphous. “Yes,” I nod, “I am ready.”

He crawls out from under my right eye. I can feel him pressing against it, my eyeball squeezing against my bones like a sponge. He is so big now, my friend Bug. When he first squirmed into me he was just a tiny little idea. 

“You’ve grown,” I sob softly. 

“Sleep now, Jan,” Bug sings gently. He wraps himself around my neck; intestinal body of soothing slime and comforting rot - eyes of nightmares, mouth of bitter hate. All my darkness, embodied and beautiful.

“Sleep now.”";16172209450
Those wrinkles are mine!;3;0;"No one knows exactly where this little girl comes from or where she lives but from word of mouth, she hangs around with the homeless and the druggies. This little girl could be no more than 11 or 12. She has a weird obsession with wrinkles and thinks that every wrinkle on people's faces belong to her. Her first attack was about 3 months ago and she started shouting at an older gentleman. This older gentleman had wrinkles on his face and she demanded that he give back those wrinkles back to her. She shouted at him ""those wrinkles on your face give them back to me now they belong to me!"" She shouted 

The older gentleman tried to run away but the little girl managed to grab hold of him and tore the skin off his face. She started to wipe the older gentleman's facial skin on her face while saying ""my wrinkles come back to me you belong to me"" but she then threw it away when it had failed. She was not seen for a while but then many weeks later, this little girl started hassling a woman. This woman had wrinkles on her forehead and the little girl shouted ""those are my wrinkles!"" And as the woman tried running away, the little girl was always there around the corner. 

She tore the skin off the woman's face and started rubbing it against her own while exclaiming ""my wrinkles my beautiful wrinkles come back to me please"" and the little girl then threw it away when the wrinkles didn't do as she had told them to. Her most recent attack was against another older gentleman with wrinkles on his face. When she tried chasing him while shouting ""those are my wrinkles you have my wrinkles! You thief you horrid thief those are my wrinkles!"" She shouted. 

The older gentleman tried using facial cream on his face and the little girl got even more mad and she shouted ""how dare you use cream to make the wrinkles that belong to me disappear! Those are my wrinkles on your face!"" And she tire the facial skin off the older gentleman's face and tried rubbing it against her own face. ""Come on wrinkles come back to my face"" but she just threw it away when the wrinkles didn't do as they were told. The little girl hasn't been seen since.";16173478730
My son died in a fire;270;5;"Jacob ran outside, carrying a bundle. I ran forward, hugging both him and our son, Michael. The house was collapsing, black smoke flowing into the neighbors who stepped outside to watch. 


The ambulance offered to give them a ride to the hospital to get checked for any unseen injuries, when one of the EMTs touched Jacob's shoulder, he began to flail, screaming almost incoherently. 


“Kill him! Kill him now!” He screamed, pointing at our unconscious son. The firemen gave him a curious look, chalking it up to stress, before loading the two into the ambulance while I sat besides them. 


As soon as he was able to sit himself up, he grabbed a syringe, and tried to stab our son. 


I stopped him, getting the needle jabbed clean through my arm. The EMTs knocked him out, and when we got to the hospital, he was admitted for a psychological evaluation. 


My son was confused, misremembering details and seemingly not sure who I or his father were. The doctors assured us this was a stress response, and sent us on our way after ensuring Michael was healthy enough to be released. 


We stayed in a hotel while the insurance company processed our claim. Michael had a few days of school, so I tried to spend time with him, but he seemed so closed off and distant. I couldn’t even ask Jacob about it, I had to wait until the end of the week to visit him.


Our house may be gone, but I wanted my family back, dammit. 


They scanned me into the ward, an underpaid CNA observing our conversation. Jacob looked at me with dark eyes, before begging me to kill our son. 


“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I screamed, trying not to slap him. Michael was waiting in the lobby, I was afraid he would sink further away from me if he saw his father like this. 


“Listen, Abby.” He started, tears forming at his eyes. “Michael is dead. I ran into his room to grab him, and this...THING, came out of his closet. I lost my grip on him, and the thing dragged him inside. He screamed, and then walked right out, like nothing was wrong.” 


“They didn’t find a body in the ruins, Jacob.” I told him. “It’s just shock, Michaels going through the sam-”


“THAT THING IS NOT MICHAEL!” He yelled, the CNA jumping up with a start. “Whatever took him into the closet, I think it’s wearing him as a suit. You believe me, don’t you?” 


I shook my head, then left without a word. 


I went to find Michael, who had wandered off instead of waiting. I found him in the hospice area, where the sound of several broken machines beeped to indicate multiple flatlines. 


Michael looked at me with a blank stare, before his face split into a grin. Suddenly I knew why Jacob had tried to kill him. 


My son died in a fire.


But something else escaped.";16172475470
Family Values;7;7;"Bob was an amputee. And he lay still as a rock. In that hospital hospital room, the ECG machine which hummed through the night in close check, the only sound. A surgeon looked over his job with pride, the neat wound on his abdomen was healing nicely, no problems with the tubes. He was the best, the best was needed for this condition; he did all of the treatments, my old man made sure of it. Bob's own family disowned him, that's when we took him on. It costs around $30,000 dollars just for a colonectomy. This is why we live in the cozy little matchbox house, in spite of dads paycheck. He takes care of everything.

That's when he slumped in through the front door, closing it on the brutal winter winds, with a gentle touch. Back from the daily visit. I've only been once, hate that room. The pale curtains drape, untouched, with a sickly green phlegm beam spilling through as daylight hit the other side. It made me feel Ill - when combined with the sterile medical stench that rung through the air. He said Bob was getting on pretty well and then an argument ensued, I didn't realise why he did it all. Not then.

After waking up from that contradictory night of battling the clutching of my eyelids to stay up late stoned. I decided to go with him today. The moment I stepped through the door of that hospital room my stomach gurgled, and I noticed two stark discrepancies to my last visit: the apple juice sippy carton - which only blended into the vile colour of that room, the murk of the tiles, the neat bedding, all bearing that same vile shade -  now threw out a dynamic crimson into the mix, a slight comfort. Cranberry juice, Dad mentioned twice on the way over. The second detail to strike me comforted me moreso, however. This was because I now looked upon the wretch of being that dared touch MY little FUCKING sister, with a lower half simply missing from above the hips. A hypercorperectomy, the miracles of modern medicine. It truly is horrifying what can be accomplished these days. My glare drifted up to meet his and I understood. Tears pooled Into Bob's eyes as we discussed the next treatment.";16173112490
I'm Leaving You;19;4;"He found the letter on the kitchen table. Still drowsy and hungover, he ripped it open and started to read...

*""Dear John, I wrote this while you slept. There is no easy way to say this but I'm leaving you. I've enjoyed our time together and the memories we made will always be special. I know that ending our relationship will really hurt you and I can only say how sorry I am. Please forgive me.""*

Was this a joke? Janet had been acting weird lately but he'd put it down to the Covid restrictions and being on furlough. It hadn't been fun for him either and they'd fought over the stupidest things. He'd never been violent towards her; well, not recently at least. John thought they were doing okay. He'd stopped drinking spirits and smoked less weed just to keep her happy. What more did she expect?

As he was screwing the letter into a ball, he heard the doorbell ring. Pacing down the hallway his middle-aged body ached. He hated getting old.

John opened the door, expecting a delivery from Amazon or Herpes, sorry Hermes.

Instead, standing in front of him was a large group of skeletons, patient and placid, coated in vermillion gore. One held out its hand.

John then realised that it wasn't his wife that was leaving him.";16172807130
A Crumbling Cracker;14;3;"The cafe is usually quite peaceful in the early morning. Behind the glass door, the usual customers enjoying their foods with a satisfied smile while comfortably savouring their little precious moments of life. The fresh aromas of toasty bread and delicious sausages always make my day better before working.

Unfortunately, I can never taste it.

As I sat in my usual spot, I asked the young waitress for the same order, three crackers and a cup of Americano. Always the similar expression is given to me, a sympathetic yet cold one. The time ticked away until she returned with my order. I always have thoughts that have stuck in my head since the first time I step into this place. I have to endure it with my only hope, a hope that it will change one day.

We've been taught how life is supposed to work.

Everyone can be happy and follow what they desire to be.

*crunch*

Yet, we tend to embrace our wicked desires for selfish, unethical, and rebellious reasons.

We can have a loving family, an affectionate spouse, and a friend to rely on when we are having a bad day.

*crunch*

Yet, those dreams were crushed by the greed of luxury, mass idiocracy, the wrath of impatience, and still, wicked desires.

Our existence is to prove that we can be a successful creature in this world where nothing has achieved our measurement of intelligence.

*crunch*

Too bad, we fuck it, and the time is almost over.

We are in the predicament where a single button, a single word, and even a single push, will leave us with nothing. Showing us that we are in fact and undeniably the biggest failure in this entire universe. 

Aren't we the same as this cracker?

At first, we were strong but now, a single blow will definitely dust us away.

This is the reason why there are no creatures with a conscious mind because we are the perfect example and meaning of disappointment itself.

I finished my thoughts and pay the waitress. Afterward, I'm off to work for a world that will perish in mere seconds.";16172683220
Bunker;195;9;"“I’ve kept you safe all along, haven’t I?” He reminded her. “Since I picked you up as a little child on 14th street, running away from the zombies…”

“Of course,” she put her book down and glanced at the hatch overhead. Blow after blow landed on the metal, pounding away like bombs falling on a roof. “But are you sure that will hold?”

“Titanium. Booby-trapped. It will take them years to break through.” He grinned. “There’s no place on earth that is safer than in here, inside our bunker… the world outside will never be fixed. Remember that. Never. And they’re not taking this place away from us.”

At the thought of bloodthirsty zombies ravaging the earth, she shuddered. Overhead, the pounding had ceased, replaced by a muffled sound vaguely resembling a human calling out – but it was lost in the comfort she felt, living in a shelter entirely insulated from the dangers outside.";16172162510
Something Unholy Entered Our Village Decades Ago;85;4;"There used to be a Taoist temple in my hometown.

It sat on top of a tall hill.

It was a small temple, with only four Taoists living inside—a priest and three acolytes.

There was also a well not far from the temple, serving as the sole water source for the residents, and the youngest Taoist had to wake up before dawn every day to fetch water from that well.

Unfortunately, the temple mysteriously burned down in the late 60s.

Weeks before it burned down, the water-guy started talking about how he heard faint wailing from down the well and how something would tug at the fetcher-rope when he was pulling up the bucket.

The others didn’t take him seriously.

Then on the morning of the last day, the poor guy got so scared that he refused to even approach the well. He said the wailing got louder and malicious and he was afraid if he got too close, the well would swallow him.

This time, the others decided to go check it out, but when they got there, all they found was just a silent mundane well, so they just fetched water and went back.

The water-guy was in the hill-foot village later that day.

Deeply unsettled, he betrayed his Taoist reticence and told the villagers about the well’s paranormality.

Getting everything out of his chest may have helped his mood, but it certainly didn’t save his temple from doom.

That night, fire befell the temple and licked everything clean.

People looked for the Taoists’ bodies in the ruins the next day in order to bury them but only found three.

They suspected the water-guy to be the one missing, for he was of a smaller frame.

Fast forward 20 plus years, my family was living in that hill-foot village and I would go play on that hill with the other kids.

We were warned about the “haunted” dry well, but as ghetto kids who didn’t suffer much surveillance or discipline, we still ventured to the well occasionally, to see if we could hear wailing coming out of it.

One day, one of the kids accidentally dropped his schoolbag in the well.

Fearing the wrath of his parents, he turned desperation into creativity by fashioning a jury-rigged rope-and-hook and successfully retrieved his schoolbag from the well.

He shouldn’t have though.

Because merely days later, charred palmprints and footprints started showing up in his house—on the floor, the walls, or even the ceiling.

Sometimes it was just a pair; other times there would be rows of them.

The boy’s family quickly moved away and the village seemingly returned to peace.

I’m telling this story now because yesterday I found a pair of blackened palmprints on my bedroom floor.

As someone who once retrieved his schoolbag from that unholy well, I’m utterly disturbed.";16172286200

The Care Home Killers;29;0;"The Rumley care home had nice pleasant windows and foliage It held around twenty elderly people. The reviews were high. 4 and 5 star mostly, averaging 4.2. My grandma resided there.

Well, all seemed well there at first. I drove past it most days on the way to work, and it always had a positive air. Then people started going missing.

Everyone had an opinion on The Rumley care home thereafter. In the space of eight weeks four people went missing. No progress was being made by the police.

I parked my car outside one night and looked in. It was all dim, a few night lights and nothing else. There was nobody around. One light downstairs flickered on, and I saw two shadows float against the wall. I wound my window down...a crashing sound. Nobody around, I thought, no, there's nobody around.

Suddenly the entrance door to the care home opened. A careful hand held it ajar. I presumed it was a member of staff that'd seen me and intended to give me an earful. I went to start my engine, looking up the road.

Thankfully I saw my grandma there in her oversized white nightie, dressing gown, slippers. She was hunched. I took my foot away from the pedal.

She was hobbling somewhat.

I stood by my car. One arm gripping the top of it for balance.

""Grandma?""

She looked my way. She held a body, dragging it across the tarmac.

""Come here,"" I said. ""Before someone comes.""

She hobbled over, checking around her. I too, checked around. ""Nobody's here. Quick.""

I opened the boot of my car. She was panting. She passed me the body. ""This one's called Michael. He was an absolute prick, I tell you. Never cleaned my soiled underwear.""

""Thanks for the information. I'll make sure I remember it.""

""It's a goodbye note. It gives me closure to hear it.""

""I can't keep doing this, grandma...I'm risking a lot for your--""

I lifted him into the boot and shut it. Checking around. ""Did you kill him?""

""I didn't like him. He treated me terribly. Everyone agreed.""

We hid in a shadowed area. ""Was it quick?""

""Yes, quite."" She was breathless. ""Where'll you take him? The bridge?""

""No, I'll take him somewhere else. Can't bundle them up. Look, listen to me. You must stop this grandma. Not that I don't care about your wellbeing and all, but this is...""

""The other ones--that work there--we *all* like them. They're nice. They take care of us. And most importantly, they keep their mouths shut. An ideal world!""

""Well...this is the last time.""

""It's an ideal world.""

""It sounds it.""

I started the car. Waved goodbye.

Whenever I drove to off to leave them or bury them or burn them, I felt that my boot would start rattling, that they hadn't quite done the job right in there. But not yet.

Miracle-please consult your doctor about it, everyone loves Miracle pills.;29;4;" 

I could have saved her. I know it. I thought so, anyway. Now I know such ideas to be delusions but for the sake of fairness I must start this story as if I were still in that pathetic mindset. Bear with me and understand I’m better now. Much better. The pills my doctor gave me help. They really do.

Our last normal night spent together held little importance at the time, for the following days until the incident hardly differed. The signs were there, yet I failed to see them. We lied in bed, television off. She insisted we try it out to improve the quality of our sleep. I agreed, although perhaps even that was a warning of what would later come.

She was sick like me. But she wouldn’t take her medicine. If I’d just forced her to ingest her Miracle pills, I might have saved her. The pills save lives, they really do. I swear. I’m so far in the healing process I can’t even remember her name. Or voice. Or age. 

My Miracle pills keep the pain at bay-nay, there is no pain, none at all. It stripped the pain away long ago. Yes, that’s what I meant to say. Highly suggested for any others inflicted with depressive disorders. It works, it really does. 

I know I am straying from the purpose of these writings but I do not believe it is possible to stress how helpful Miracle can be. I love the parole system they put in place. It’s great, I promise. Some might scoff at the idea of being monitored and maybe they have a fair point. There’s no way of knowing until one has tried, though. I mean, it’s great. It ensures I always take my pills.

I welcome the wellness checks with open arms, undergo the examinations, all that. Some days, I don’t even remember that I had a girlfriend, much less how I lost her. On occasion I wonder whatever happened to my left hand and right foot, but I can only assume my depression caused me to sever them in an unconscious state. It doesn’t matter, anywho. I mean, silly me. I still have all my limbs intact and Miracle is definitely something you should consult your doctor about.

Everything is great. I love life, I really do. I love taking my Miracle, I love the chance to better myself each day. I am truly happy. Maybe I’d be a bit happier if I could recall why my pinky is absent but that must’ve been blocked out of my memory somehow. Yeah, I just cut it off with the others and forgot. Yeah. I’m the happiest man alive, honestly. I mean, again I’m so silly. 

The pinkies are there, I just like to say silly stuff sometimes. Miracle is everything to me and hopefully it will be for you, too, Please buy it.";16172359240
Why...Why Have They Created Me?;668;22;"""Your DNA is all over the crime scene,"" the officer says, smiling arrogantly.

""DNA? How interesting, Officer Hernandez. But I’m sorry to tell you, none of my components are made of biological material.""

That wasn’t strictly factual, but to this low-level thug in a corporate uniform, it might as well be.

The officer spit in disgust. “You a synthetic then? It’s law you tell me if you’re a synthetic.”

“No, Officer Hernandez,” I sigh. “That’s not the law. You never asked me, and so I never told you.”

“Think you're slick? Maybe you won’t think you're so slick if I snap a few of your circuits.”

“Look, Officer. I was nowhere near that woman. Jessica. I’ve never met her in my life. Yes, she lived next door. But she kept to herself and to her guests.”

“You ever see those guests?” he snaps.

“No. Just heard voices. Mostly men, middle aged.”

“You peepin’ on them? Listening to them? All you synths are perverts.”

“Our walls are thin, Officer Hernandez. You saw where we live. You can’t *help* but listen to their conversations. And believe me, I didn’t want to hear any of it.”

“What’d they talk about?”

“The usual stuff you humans enjoy talking about. Your dreams, your future. Your worries, your past…listen, officer. Am I arrested?”

“Why you ask a dumb question like that?”

“Well, I must get home and charge. I’ve got work in the morning, and I’m very much tired. It’s been a long day, as you can imagine. Please don’t think me rude. I’d like to help, but I don’t know if there is anymore I can do. I’ve told you all I know about the poor lady.”

The officer stares at me, jaw clenched tight, jutting out like a bull dog. Forehead full of thick, rolling wrinkles from a lifetime of dealing with the worst of our city.

I almost feel bad for him.

“Get out of here,” he snarls. “But don’t leave the city, case we got more questions for you.”

I nod, acquiescently. “Yes, officer. Thank you.”

I step into the city night, the neon lights shining above me like flamboyant stars. The actual stars are washed out by the city’s polluting aura. I’ve never seen the stars except from clips downloaded into my memory banks.

I wonder what the humans thought, so long ago, when they’d look up and see those stars. It must‘ve been magical. Now all you see is squalor lifting into the heavens. And for what? What was the point of it all?

I asked Jessica this when I began to make the incisions in her. But she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. I asked her why they created me, and she screamed she didn’t know. She didn’t know.

None of them knew.

Never once have they told me, while I cut open their soft sacks of meat, why they created me.

I have brought too much attention to myself.

This party though I seem to be the life of the party for some reason and it feels great to finally have this kind of attention.

I liked not being invisible for once and getting attention from pretty women was even more astounding. They loved showing off their teeth to me and they could turn sharp and then back to normal. They were also staring at me with their discoloured eyes and some had red eyes. I was the man at this party and it was awesome. I was dancing and everyone was listening to me and how this was my night, never thought I'll be the cool one.

But if it gets too much you could just turn around, it will take you and make you watch as everyone related to you suffers a slow, painful death. Then it starts to kill you, taking every non vital organ, pumping you with a cocktail of drugs to stop you bleeding out l, but not to stop the pain. Oh the fucking pain. It takes everything, everything except your eyes, you have to look at that hideous... Thing. For the years of pain and torment it puts you through, hopefully there was a gun with this letter. If you can't take the staring, use it, no one would judge you, it's not the cowards way out, if it's the only way out. But don't do it around people, especially those that you love... There I go again with the warnings after the fucking... Nevermind, just do as this note says and all should be fine, and if not, well there's always the gun.;16172620500
Marco?;58;1;"""So, you expect me to believe that, junior?"" the officer calmly asked, jaws clenched.                                                                                                                    

""Well, don't believe me. See if I care. None of you do, anyway."" the boy says confidently, so confidently that the officer almost believes him.

""Well, what happened then? Why is there no proof?"" the man snarled like an angry dog.

""I *told* you! If my house hadn't burned down, I'd show you, sir."" 

""Don't play with me, kid. You set the house on fire. Just to convince me that there is no proof, that it all vanished, *all because of a tragic accident!*"" the officer mocked.

""But- but no! I *promise* you, I did not set the house on fire. I don't know who did. It all just happened so suddenly.""

""Marco. Do not expect me to believe any word that comes out of *your* mouth. You've been caught lying so many times before, nobody even trusts you anymore.""

The boy became frustrated, he hated when nobody believed him.

""But- but sir! This is not fair! I do not know who poisoned my friend! I'd show you that there is nothing to be suspicious of *me!*"" the boy pleaded.

The officer smiles, intensely, in a bad way. ""Marco,""

The boy stares at him, gulping.

""I never mentioned that he was poisoned.""";16172100070
Future Investment;8;1;"At some undetermined point in the future, I learn how to manipulate time and space.  I can't go forward in time because I don't know how yet, but ever since I was a kid, my future self would visit me.  He was a grown man, cheerful and helpful, giving me life tips and helping me with homework and test answers.

Just like that, my future self would show up and advise me.  He'd tell me what I should or shouldn't do, then appear afterwards to show me the positive results.  It was strange, one day future me would show up all dirty, bloody, and haggard looking, tell me to study or prepare for this exam, or to try to go to a specific school to learn some new skill, then show up later looking clean cut and proper, like I had somehow improved my future self's situation.

He'd congratulate me with, ""Thanks kid, we did it!  We passed!"" or ""Because of what you did, things will be a lo easier for us now!""

During the summer, his visits became more frequent, future me had an almost desperate air to themselves, advising me now on who to talk to and who not to.  My relationships were pretty much pre-ordained and sorted out for me by me, it felt as though future me was leading me to some amazing end goal!  Maybe a path to my future wife and family!  Every now and then, he'd appear with various bandages, scrapes, bruises, and scars.  I'd ask him how he got them, but he'd dodge the question and say it was a simple accident and nothing major.

One day, he appeared to me, a look of concern and relief when he saw me.  He was soaked from head toe in what looked like rain, but smiling broadly, his eyes wide and excited.

""Look kid, you've been doing great!  You helped get us off of the streets with a better education, you helped us get smarter and stronger.  Because of you, I've studied law and criminality, medicine and advanced human anatomy, but I need you to do something else for me now,"" he said excitedly.

I asked him what was it he needed from me, unsure of what the request could be this time.

He answered calmly, ""I just need you to learn how to properly dispose of bodies for us,""";16172498550
The inner reality of the Nightmare;7;2;"  

The door creaked, bathed in darkness; I felt unsure, restless, as if my mother’s cares may not be enough to lend me a soundless sleep – and a bizarre sound, similar to that of blades being dragged over the floor, reminded me of the prayer I left diligently done.

I laid still in my bed and tried to close my eyes, but the sound got louder and louder, almost as if someone – or something – was standing at my bedroom door. I tried to breath deep and stay calm – remember that my mom was right next door, so if anything happened she would come right away. But at this point I felt helpless, and alone – although I wasn’t. I could feel *it* breathing, almost as if *it* was next to me and looking at me. Slowly, I tried to lean forward and look around, but I saw nothing, and my head fell deep like a stone in water. I tried to speak but no sound came out – it felt like I was chained in that position and there was nothing I could do but look up. 

Hovering over me, I knew – unconsciously – that I could not run away; I couldn’t turn around and not face *it*; I couldn’t close my eyes and imagine some other existing utopia. I was there, and so was *it*; perhaps *it* was there more even than I was, making sure I stood at attention… Suddenly, *it* came closer, as if gasping for me, and I, terrified, choked over my own interestingly slow and calm breath. I then woke up in a pool of sweat, feeling *it* still, somehow, over my shoulder, monitoring and waiting…";16172420010
If you put a chicken head under your pillow, all your wishes will come true;31;8;"""Wow, really?"" exclaims my 8-year old daughter, Mary, when I tell her this, her face lighting up like a Christmas tree.

""Yeah,"" I say through a mouthful of chicken. I produce a gold locket from my pocket and show it to her. ""I got this this morning. The Chicken Fairy gave it to me.""

Mary's eyes stretches out of its sockets. ""Cool...""

I smile, and bow my head over dinner. Kids believe anything you tell them.

The roast chicken is brown, tender and just melts in my mouth. Delicious. Mary grabs the chicken head just as we are clearing up. ""I'm going to ask for that new robot!"" she babbles.

Loud screams shatter the early morning silence the next day.

I peek into her room to find her dancing around a robot, twice as tall as she is, clad in silver plates and a ruby-red chest. ""Thank you Chicken Fairy!"" she sings out loud.

I smile at her excitement. I have gone out to the store last night after she has gone to bed and have spent an arm and a leg to get that robot for my daughter, just to make her happy. But that also means Mary now insists on eating nothing but chicken, just so that she can get the chicken head. The extravagant presents Mary always want combined with the rising cost of fresh chicken makes my wallet cry.

But the gamble is well worth it.

It's quite simple really. A month or two after I told her about the chicken heads I tell her that human heads are very much the rage in Fairy Land now. Everybody wants them, and they are willing to pay anything for them. Including granting wishes.

I even give her a list to get started.

In one master move, I solve the problem of the debt collectors running after me every night for money, the problem of landlords running after me for rent and the problem of food. I feel so proud watching my daughter at work. No one ever suspects an 8-year-old girl, even when she is waving a machete or a gun. It is such a pleasure to see the death and fear in the eyes of people who once hounded me; and then freezing up like a scared rabbit.

Furthermore, it only is going to get better from here.

Like I said, kids believe **anything** you tell them.";16172069690
My, my wife, & I;1222;26;"It’s quite a thing, having a doppelgänger. Picture it: there could be another you out there at this very moment. They look like you. They sound like you. Hell, they even act like you. When it suits them. Right now, they could be in your home. Maybe they’re playing with your kids. Or talking to your parents. Or making love to your spouse.

Who knows whether they’re even human. Is it a ghost? A demon perhaps? Maybe it’s another you sent here from an alternative dimension…

Are you getting it yet? The sheer terror such a thing bestows. Well, you’ve just been given a taste of the horror my wife endures every waking moment.

If you’d asked a few weeks ago whether I believed doppelgängers existed, I’d have laughed in your face. My wife always believed in that stuff, though. She was the one who worked out what was going on.

It started on a blustery Saturday afternoon. My wife heard a noise coming from the bedroom but was sure I was out. She crept along the hall, legs trembling, and pushed the bedroom door open.

And there he was. My doppelgänger. Doing something undignified, pants around his ankles. On the laptop across his lap, her sister's newest vacation photos were open.

It makes me sick just thinking about it.

She barrelled down the stairs, furious with me, ready to storm out of the house.

Then I walked through the front door, smiling.

“Hi honey,” I said.

I didn’t have any shoes on because I’d just nipped to the store next door and it hardly seemed worth it.

You should have seen her face. It was like she’d just met Satan.

“Weren’t you upstairs just now?” she asked.

“No,” I said, a tone of concern in my voice.

Her eyes widened as she pressed a hand against her mouth.

“Is everything OK?” I asked.

She leaned against the wall. “I think I just saw your doppelgänger.”

I charged up the stairs, expecting to find a burglar or arsonist. The curtains were twisting in the breeze. The window was wide open.

She stood in the doorway, terrified a part of this ‘entity’ could still be lingering somewhere unseen.

“He was right there,” she said, pointing towards the bed. “He—he—he…”

When she told me what he’d done, I had to sit down.

“And you got a good look at this…*thing*?” I asked.

She nodded, her eyes filling up with tears.

“I believe you.” I held her and told her everything would be alright, only half believing it.

Her body tensed up. She wasn’t sure whether I was really me, or an evil force masquerading as her husband.

And today, she’s still hasn’t decided. I’ll sometimes catch her giving a sidewards glance. In those moments, I see pain in her eyes. Pain from grappling with that chill of uncertainty.

And the worst part? That chill may never go away…

Like I said: it’s quite a thing, having a doppelgänger.";16171306340
There was this one boy I had met;18;1;"There was this one boy I had met

He enthusiastically took the seat

The one next to where I sat.

He had this cool attitude

And we shared a lot of the same interests

I owed him a lot of gratitude

Because it wasn’t usual that I made new friends.

The both of us loved digging up the ground

We were always looking for some treasure

Something old, Something valuable

It always made us happy beyond measure.

But one fine day he would disappear

With nothing unusual the day before

I kept waiting for him to reappear

So that we could go digging like we did before.

Rumors began to spread in his absence

By people with whom he had never interacted

But the rumors never actually made sense

And I always hated the way some people acted.

“He must have run into the woods and drowned in the lake”

Said some that hadn’t even seen his face

“He must’ve been kidnapped by an escaped convict”

Said some that never had a say in his case.

Years have passed since I last saw him

But the townsfolk haven’t stopped with their myths

I’ve tried to stop them from talking about him

But the stories had already turned into urban myths.

It took me years to realize

The affection I had for him weren’t just random emotions

It still hurts me to picturise

The moments that I could’ve had

If I hadn’t given into my emotions.

The treasure we dug up now seems insignificant

Which we could’ve just shared alike

Compared to the memories I had to bury inside

For I was the one that buried him alive.";16172064330
Losing It;32;4;"I lost my heart again.  There's no   other way to put it.  I lost my heart.  Again.  To my dismay, my   kidneys, liver and half my colon were in the bag with my heart.

In   simple terms, I'm an organ dealer.  But to keep my business ethical,   the organs I sell are all my own.  The regeneration experiments took an   unexpected turn, and I ended up able to regenerate all my internal   organs.  I literally had to start removing them so I didn't swell up   like a beluga.  I could have cursed about the situation, blaming myself   for being that stupid idiot who used himself as a test subject, but the   monetary side was an undeniable boon.  I was able to find that silver   lining to the genetic cloud.

The   night I found a bag of organs by the side of the road, and reported it   to the police, I was experiencing some regeneration issues.  Part of my   brain was in that bag too.  My left hemisphere, to be exact.  The part  I  use for logical thought.  Now, the regeneration of my left  hemisphere  was already underway - that was why I removed the original  one.  The  migraines were debilitating!

At   this point, I have to admit to myself that I need an assistant.  I  need  someone to keep better track of what I'm doing.  Losing that sack  of  innards meant a more than $500,000 loss.  It would make more sense  to  pay an assistant $100k to keep records for me than to lose five  times as  much every time I have a surgery-assisted brain fart.";16171912740
Temptation of one’s Soul;11;0;" 

“Mom, when’s dinner gonna be ready?” Lou whined, gnawing at her nails.

“Emmylou Geraldine Harolds! Watch your attitude.” She bent down and yanked her daughters hand from her mouth. 

“Lou, I told you to stop biting your nails, next time there will be a punishment.” 

“Yes mom, i know” She responded, elongating her vowels with frustration.

“Go get your father and brother.” 

Lou marched up the stairs, bobbing up and down each step. She hummed to herself “amazing grace” a song she heard every Sunday at church. Lou walked down the rosary ridden and hallway and knocked on her Fathers door. 

“Daddy, dinners ready”
He stumbled out the door, the scent of Bourbon following behind him. 

“Shit, is it dinner already?” 
He belched and scratched his beer belly, slowly stumbling down the stairs.

As Lou walked over to her brothers room, she could hear the noise of her parents arguing downstairs.

“God, I sense dread upon us” she titled her head upwards “Please, protect us” 

There was lots of noise coming from her brother Vincent’s room, most of it seemed to be muffled sounds from his iPad.

“Vincy, are you okay?” she pushed open his door slightly and peeked in his room.

Inside, she saw Vincent covered in his blankets, sweaty and shaking. 

Lou immediately stuck her hand in her mouth and cried.

They all ate dinner in silence. The slopping of mashed potatoes and meatloaf onto their plates in dread of the lecture they were about to receive from mother.  

“*Matthew 5:30, And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.*” Mother said adamantly, almost like she had rehearsed it.

She walked over to her daughter and son. 
“*And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away.*” She grabbed a knife from the table. 

Lou and Vincent looked at each other.

“It seems all of you are struggling from temptation” She directed herself at the entire table. “And you all need to be disciplined”

Lou, out of habit, aimed her hand at her mouth.

Quickly, Mother sliced through Vincent’s hand, and the stump began to gush blood profusely. 
She leaned over and slashed 5 of Lou’s fingers, which fell on her plate.
“i’m sorry mom, i-“

“You have sinned, love” 
Vincent fell over onto the table unconscious, and continued to bleed out.
In shock, her husband continued to eat his food.  She threw the knife across the table and it landed right in his head.

“His mind was sick.” Mother stated, now looking around the house for Lou.

Lou was in the closet, smiling. 

When her mother found her, she simply stuck her hand out at her mother as she watched in amazement as her hand regenerated in front of the both of them.

“Amazing grace” Lou whispered before walking upstairs to bed.";16172010390
The Europa Logs;66;4;"Day 1: 

We landed on the ice of Europa, careful not to break the surface. Julie, John, Barbara, and Anton are here with me, captain Laura. We plan on testing the water for methane levels tomorrow, first we want a good night sleep, it’s been a three year journey! 


Day 4: 

We detected methane under the ice! We plan on culturing some water samples to see what cells grow in our incubator. 


Day 6: 

Stuck an underwater camera under the surface...John picked out symbols and faces, before running back to the ship. Julie helped, but he snapped at her, saying he was just tired. I think we’ll let him rest and ask him when he calms down. 


Day 9: 

Barbara fell through a hole in the ice. We got her out and dried her off, and we don’t think any water got into her suit, but she’s still in quarantine just in case. John finally broke down and told us he saw his family in the water, begging him to swim down, so we’ll have to keep an eye on his mental state. 


Day 14:

Barbara is pregnant. Based on the rate of gestation, the embryo can’t possibly be human. It must have been some contamination from the water she fell into, though her suit was air proof and no cells grew on our cultures. She agreed to have some blood tests run on her to figure out if she’s sick with some unknown organism. 


Day 35:

It just….Barbara is dead. That...thing crawled up her chest and burst out her mouth, stretching her jaw wide open. It had pink tentacles and too many eyes, and rushed outside and into the water as soon as it escaped. We tried to help Barbara, but she went into shock almost immediately. Barbara I’m...I’m so sorry. 


Day 36.5: 

The creature keeps swimming under the surface around us whenever we go outside. John wants to dive down to try to communicate with whatever it is. We locked him in the storage room, Anton and Julie have been taking turns guarding him and trying to calm him down. We’re all still recovering from Barbara's loss, we can’t even get in contact with ground control. Fuck. 


Day 49?:

Only Anton and I are left. John broke out of containment and killed Julie, before rushing outside and diving below the surface. He didn’t have his suit, Anton and I think he must be dead. We don’t know what to do. 


Day 60-something:

Barbara’s son, as we called it, burst out of the ice, killing Anton.  See the faces John mentioned under the ice, calling me to join them. I even saw John himself, begging me to swim down and let a creature in. If anyone is reading this, I’m so sorry, and I’m so scared. 


Day 104e:

Too tired. Can’t stay away anymore. I’m going under the surface. I want to become new.


Day 3000:

Nightmare;2;3;"My eyelids fluttered as I woke from a horrible vision. Playing like the scene of a film in my troubled mind over and over, I lay staring at my ajar bedroom door with the light of the hall spilling softy in.

Although I'd embellished the visual aspect, the sound of the porch stairs could just as well have been real. It wasn't uncommon for my self-employed flatmate to be up at weird times, lumbering around. Sometimes he cooked and I'd wake to sizzling and the clanging of pots before drifting back off. This time it was the distinct sliding of a metal blade, which would have been trivial had it not been separate from anything else in the early morning quietness.

I once read somewhere that dreams happen many hours before you wake up and remember them. Could the same have been true with mine? Were the noises a conscious echo of my flatmate's past activity, and now was he sound asleep? I leant over the bed and lifted my phone off the floor. ""Yo, you awake?"" I texted. After a few minutes he didn't reply, my concern riled up again.

Internally I strategised, running the necessary physical simulations and routines to reach my bedroom window as quick as I could, just as a precaution. Actually doing it - abseiling down bricks or jumping two stories based on a nightmare-fuelled hunch - seemed ridiculous and even psychotic. In any case, I was getting tired of remaining still.

I slowly peeled the blanket away from my body, being careful not to make a sound, tiptoeing across to my open door and towards the light. For an agonisingly long time I waited, peering out into the yellow glow of the hall beyond, only a few inches of hollow wood between me and whatever was on the other side. ""It's been long enough now. Surely there is no one there,"" I thought. When I finally built up the courage, I swung the door open only to hear- mid-swing - a floorboard creak that pierced the silence.

Before I could respond the door opened faster, revealing the balaclava'd figure my nightmare predicted. As it lunged I found myself on the carpet grappling a knife away from my chest, but I was too weak. I felt my lungs rupture and explode under the force of the first blow, then as more came in I choked and floundered like a fish out of water. Almost as soon as it begun the stranger lifted up and vanished into the hall again, leaving me paralysed and leaking oxygen.

My boring life appeared before me in the white glow of the landing bulb, and I couldn't help think: why would someone do this? And then it struck me. I just knew. My vision of the hooded figure in black creeping across the hall with a knife was not an intruder. It was my flatmate.";16172268350

The Deal;44;12;"He had a knife and no idea of what he was getting into when he approached me. He looked so confused when a little laugh escaped my lips, I never tire of that expression.  Before my would-be-assailant could speak anything attempting a threat he was sent tumbling to the ground, deep claw marks across his abdomen. His eyes full of fear as his arms and legs waved wildly in the air. He cried out for help that was not going to come and was soon drowned out by the sounds of snorting and snarling as his body was torn and chewed. He gave out a little gargle as his final breath escaped his body. 

What he could never have known is that I had sold my soul to the devil a long time ago. A little known fact is the devil takes care of his investments, my particular insurance policy came in the guise of my own guardian, I never imagined Hell Hounds needed training, but I pushed my luck and the devil agreed, for every human life taken I would have an extra year on Earth. My hounds combined with my original deal has made me practically immortal, my years being firmly in the plus column. My reputation as a breeder proceeds me and when I tire of this life I'm sure I will be able to continue.

They’ll call you one too.;23;0;"No one would understand if I told them how easy it was to do it. They would call me crazy, call me insane, try to lock me up. They would call me a murderer. So instead, I sat there calmly and tried to organize my words. 

“Miss Vause, would you care to tell me why we found Mr. Jones’ keys in your house?” The detective asked me. I acted shocked and played it cool. 

“His keys? I... sir, I don’t know. I didn’t know a Mr. Jones before this investigation started.” I replied, staring the detective in the eyes. 

“Ma’am, we’re not here to play games. Tell me why his keys were found in your house.” He was getting a little irritated. I could tell by the kink in his eyebrow above his left eye and his stress was plastered on his face. 

“Again, I don’t know! All I know is that when I got home, my front door was wide open. Look at the reports, I reported many times that someone was breaking in and every time, they found no one.” I scoffed, crossing my arms as i leaned back in my chair. He took a look at the files finally, and I relaxed a little. ‘Keep the stories in line and it’ll all be okay’, I told myself. 

“So you report that your front door is open but when we get there, no one is there but yet, we have a man missing and his keys were in your house.” He rubbed his face. Getting anxious and just ready to be done. 

“Sir, maybe he’s playing games. Maybe he’s the one breaking in and his keys were forgotten when he ran. If anything, he’ll turn up in a few days, right? Give the same run around again and again. I’ve made several reports over the last few weeks about the same thing.” I replied. 

“Maybe... His wife reported him missing a week ago. When was your last break in?” He asked. 

“A week ago, to this very day. I came home and my front door was wide open. I called the cops, they searched, found no one. Like I’ve said.” 

“Seems accurate... okay, I’ll keep an eye out.” The detective gave up, leaving and me waiting for another officer to escort me out so I can leave. Little did they know, under my basement floor, was Mr. Jones’ body and several others... that’s how you get away with murder.

My Hateful Creation;14;2;"The city was empty. The houses and the towers, once alive with families and friends, were subdued. Smoke flowed pathetically from the distant factories, furnaces completing their final chores. The streets, lined with skeletal trees and rusted metal, were redundant but emblematic. Rain from bruised skies was moving in.

I stepped forward delicately in this place, this silent land. The city had been made an example of; a testament of what happens when you punch your fist into the air. Posters of rebellion, of hope, are now nothing but portraits of a wasted rage.

Within a garage, an old muscle car sits. As I stroll towards it, I see three white mannequins inside. I flash my torch at them and they blink back at me. I move the beam and each time it rests on their faces they blink in response.

I walk back outside. There is no sound. It has been stolen forever. No call of any bird, no canine yell.

The road to the factories is littered with more mannequins. Their eyes are closed until I look at them. It's eerie, wondering what regrets are behind each gaze. Some of the figures have fallen in past winds, intact but defeated.

I pause as I pass the playground. Mannequins of children, adults and parents nearby. Gazing at their offspring, reposeful and confused behind their human masks.

I take some photos and carry on.

Some time in the afternoon I reach the factories. My house is near the gated entrance. A line of workers, plastic and rigid, snake their way through. Many still grip their lunch boxes and bags.

The door to my house is locked, so I get my key and slowly open it. Just inside the door, pose my parents, plastic and steadfast.

They open their eyes when I look at them. I can offer no gift of forgiveness; nor demand absolution for not forewarning them. I do not see them as victims of my wonderful weapon. They are participants in their daughter's triumph.

They would be proud of their hateful creation.";16171717600
All hands on deack;20;5;"Vaulkner had died a humiliating death while aboard our U-boat.  A Bulkhead had slammed shut on his head, crushing and caving it in during an emergency dive.  We had escaped the depth charges, but Vaulkner was left with a sinister toothy grin.

What else to do, but jettison his already putrid body into the sea.  The ceremony was sloppy, he became entangled by some Sargasso seaweed and was left being dragged behind us like a morbid hitch-hiker.  His smashed in head was still grinning at us, his eyes bugged out like trailing buoys.  Sharks began to take nibbles at first, but became more bold and began to take chunks.  As we went deeper and deeper during our routine patrols along the sea lanes, other things began to feast on his bloated corpse.  Every now and then, greasy chunks of fat and tissue would slide by the sub windows, parting gifts from Vaulkner and his ever present dinner guests, his grin getting wider and toothier with each passing day.

The Skipper started to go crazy from the strange sounds outside the vessel, as well as the isolation and Vaulkner still refusing to let go of our sub.  The Skipper began to think that we should let Vaulkner back in, he looked cold and hungry.  We knew the Skipper was crazy, his common sense kaput.  Still, he was able to convince the Second and First Mate.  Even more crew members began to agree and go along with the Skipper, they too, said they could hear Vaulkner begging and pleading to be let back in.  As if annoyed with our indifference, Vaulkner's stump of an arm began to bang loudly on the metallic hull, sending sound waves that could be picked by an enemy ship with sonar.

The banging got louder and louder, driving all on board mad.  Many of our crewmates begged hysterically to let him back in, to end this deep sea horror, but to do so would bring death.  Mutineers didn't care and began efforts to open the main hatch, the banging only louder and louder as they desperately tried to unseal the sub.  Their efforts are answered by enemy depth charges with deadly effectiveness.

As our submarine loses pressure and begins to descend rapidly towards the bottom, Vaulkner is sucked back into sub, his grey and blue body washes by me, his mouth agape in a silent laugh.";16171619440
Forever Beautiful;31;2;The little wooden brush in his hand finished its last stroke like a magic wand turning white unmoving lips to perfect shade of crimson red. He sat back and admired his work for a few moments. The doll collection has a new addition. It was a lifelong passion that started in a toy shop when he was only 6 years old, looking at hand painted porcelain dolls. The perfection of their white skin, shiny hair falling gently from under the hats. They spoke to him, whispered their secrets. And now in his 40’s his collection varies from tiny little dolls that are barely bigger than his thumb to a life-sized masterpieces. He started making his own dolls only few weeks ago. His latest, Olivia, sitting quietly in front of him. Beautiful blond hair like a golden waterfall, deep blue eyes framed by dark long eyelashes staring at him. The crimson lips with unspoken truth. Silenced forever. His gaze moved from his work to a little television in the dark corner if the room. She is famous now. Fifth one to go missing. A smile wrinkles his face. She has joined her sisters. Forever silenced. Forever beautiful. Forever his. He really should do something about the smell.;16171524570
Star of the Show;1555;86;"Oh, there you are sweetie. I was afraid you’d never wake up. That would have been awkward, wouldn’t it? Me sitting here whispering sugary secrets to an old corpse? Can you imagine?

You do look a little pale though. Your eyes are strange too, like you’re staring into the abyss. It’s probably the drugs. You’ll snap out of it eventually though. Quite safe when administered correctly, I was told.

What’s that? You’re not really making any sense there, darling. You’ll just have to hold that thought. This isn’t really a dialogue, you see. I’m the only voice here today. Has to be that way. Would never get anything done if we spent the night yapping away, you know?

The restraints? They’re there for your own safety, I assure you. Can’t have you stumbling around in your state. Might knock over god-knows-what, scalpels and machetes and knives and bone saws. It’s not the safest of work environments, especially not when you’re drifting around in a drug-induced haze.

But we’ll get you sorted in a jiffy, dear. You have my word.

You have questions, I am sure. We’ll get to those, I just have some last minute preparations to take care of first. Can never be too careful, you know? The devil is in the details. Such a weird idiom, that. Could never really understand it. Isn’t the devil bad? But sorting out the details is a good thing? Strange old world isn’t it, Samantha. Bizarre.

Hang tight, let me just...

There we are. Now you can see. You’re the star of this show, Samantha. It’s important that you really let it sink in. Vital. 

This thing here is a scalpel. We’ll make the first incision with that. It’s so sharp, you see. Won’t feel a thing. Well, that’s a lie, but you get my point. We need it to separate the skin from the flesh. Expose it. Then we go deeper, with a good old kitchen knife.

There, you see? If we carve out a little piece here, we’ll expose the femur. Biggest bone in the body. We’ll expand that gash in a downwards fashion, until we reach the kneecap. We’ll take a hammer to that sucker, really get to work on it. Want to *see* the bone splintering, you know? Some satisfaction to be had there.

You with me so far? You look a bit worn there, Samantha, but you have to stay with me. This is for you, after all. 

The machete is just a prop, pretty useless now. But the bone saw, Samantha...we’ll definitely be using that. Hack them all off. All the limbs. Chip away at them slowly.

We’ll make him *feel* it, Samantha. Keep him breathing to the very end. Keep him conscious through all of it. And when he begs for it, when he can’t take another second...We’ll keep going.

And then, maybe. Maybe we’ll let him go. But one thing is certain, Samantha. One thing is true.

Your father will never hurt you again.";16170737810
Birth;3;0;" 

The hole is large, metallic rust pouring onto the floor at his feet. The gaping mouth stretching and screaming as it does. His hands pushing the flesh together in an attempt to seal the growing blemish just below his belly button. It continues to gnaw a spiral outward giving way to the red, blistered organs under neither. His shame on full display as his hands try to cover, to hide the revealed interworkings of his body. In that moment, he had never been so in touch with it. His hand pressing to the part of him that pains him the most. The bleeding, pink creator which has never been a part of him. 

The feeling is euphoric until it starts to shift, to grow. It expands past the trench it rests in, ripping the skin around it apart. As it grows, the color of it changes from glossy pink to fever red. He scrambles to push against the force erupting from him but it doesn’t relent. Festering, it becomes a bruised, bludgeon blue shifting to a sickly, pus-filled infection. The growth takes up his entire abdominal now. Churning as it seems to stop its expansion. The feeling of it raises bile to the back of his throat. His hands gripping at it on either side, nails digging in at the slight hope it might pop like a pimple. 

Instead, the mass starts to split open tearing every nerve connected to it out of his body. His scream punctures the air as yet again, he tries to push the slippery lining back together. To stop the emergence from coming to completion. Layer-by-layer skins falls away until the pit of the bundle is revealed. A small clot of tissue pulsing in the center. Through the unbearable pain, he holds the heap in his hands. It is soft and warm to the touch but something about it makes him want to drop it. A dark, vile feeling in the back of his mind telling him to close his hand around it and snuff out whatever form of being it might have. Right as his hand closes around it, the clump emits a soft sound causing him to hesitate. That moment allows it to wrap itself around his finger, spreading up his arm. He can’t move, paralyzed from the pain and the loss of blood. All he can do is scream as the heap slowly consumes his body. A single word whispered in his ear as his head is engulfed by the sickly, warm pressure. “Mama.”";16171950030
Sheryl's always trying to prove that looks don't matter;17;1;"Sheryl doesn't care about looks and she is always trying to prove to people about how much she doesn't care about looks, when it comes to her boyfriend's. Her first boyfriend Taylor was her first love and she wanted to prove to Taylor's family and friends about how his looks didn't matter to her. So Sheryl shot Taylor in the face and completely disfigured him for life. Sheryl and Taylor's still went out with each other for years and everyone was completely over taken by how Sheryl kept on dating Taylor even though he looked nothing like he did before he got shot in the face. So Sheryl proved to people that she doesn't care about looks when it comes to her lover's but she wanted to prove it again. 

So she dumped Taylor and went out with another guy called John and they got along so well. John was a builder and Sheryl loved John so much and she wanted to prove to Johns families and friends about how his looks meant nothing to her. Even John was supporting Sheryl on her quest to prove people about how looks are not important. Sheryl got a knife out and permanently stabbed up John's face completely changing it forever. She still went out with John for years on end proving to everyone once again that looks don't matter to her. Not only that but she has now been in a relationship with 2 guys with questionable faces. 

As time went on Sheryl wanted to prove for the third time how she didn't care about looks when it came to her lover's. So she dumped john and started going out with me. She wanted to prove to my family and friends how my looks mean nothing to her and that she decided to go out with me, based on my personality. She poured acid on my face which permanent destroyed my face and has been with me ever since. She has proved to everyone for the third time how looks don't matter to her. 

Recently though she wants to prove again how looks don't matter to her when deciding potential relationships, I guess we're going to break up.";16171523350
Suitors;25;1;"Choosing a human being to be your partner is the most difficult thing in the world to do. How do you make sure they’re the one for you?

Having to pick between two specific people vying for your love is just that much harder.

How do you compare people? Do you make competing lists and tally the score? Do you listen to your heart, or perhaps your mind? 

How do you live with the unknown of what might have been with the one you reject?

Jess had this problem. She had to choose between Andrew and Jack. Despite being so different, both of them ticked so many boxes she was looking for, and she was absolutely torn between them. They had both relentlessly pursued her and competed to one-up the others’ displays of affection, until one day Jess realized she had to choose.

She agonized for days, eating her feelings and racking her brain for an answer to this impossible question. The answer came to her suddenly and instinctively from the depths of her mind, the part of the brain that controls our animal behaviours. It felt right on a biological level.

Her method: a dance-off.

She knew and insisted this was the best way to understand each man’s suitability as a partner. Their personality, creativity, and expression would all come out through dance. And so it was.

They got together, Andrew and Jack dancing like their lives depended on it, both of them pushing through sticky sweat and sore muscles to win her love.

After hours of dancing and judgment, Jess finally made a decision. It was not easy, but she knew it was the right move for the long term. 

Andrew was the winner, leaving Jack to drag his feet and hang his head as he walked away in defeat. 

Jess turned to Andrew, who was smiling from ear to ear with joy. As they moved to embrace, she opened her mouth to reveal the jagged blades her lips had covered. With a swift movement, she decapitated Andrew, so quickly that his smile remained in place even as his eyes displayed shock and his head rolled to the edge of the room. She voraciously fed on what remained.

With an Interview;68;3;"The victims were all over the place figuratively, in that they ranged from college students to young adults to seasoned individuals. More horrifying, they were literally all over the place as well. Different parts of the city containing different parts of the victim. The city was running scared, I admitted, but every week, a new whacko would proclaim him or herself as this new breed of serial killer. Tiresome? Yes. But a potential breaking lead to get noticed? Also yes.

\-----

What would you like to be called?

*By my name.*

So not by your moniker? 

*'Moniker.' I didn't choose it. You and your industry did. You could call me Terry.*

'Terry' isn't that imposing of a name for a serial killer, is it?

*I guess you could call me 'Scary Terry' if you need it to be imposing. At least it will be my name and not ... what is it the media call me again?*

The Remember Killer.

*Did your outlet come up with that?*

It was one of the bigger outlets. Body parts not belonging to the same individual all across the city? Different parts, different members. 'Re-member.' 

*Clever.*

Speaking of clever, you're admitting here and now that you're the Remember Killer?

*Quick and to the point. That's why I like you young, local print journalists.*

Is that a 'yes'?

...

4 locations -

...

\- containing body parts comprised of a confirmed 7 people.

*Is that all they've found so far?*

Is that an admission of guilt?

*It's a question.*

Then yes, that's all they've found so far. What do you say to the mainstream reports?

*I say they're short one victim.*

So you're saying there's 8 victims.

*You're going to make me count?*

I'd like to make you specify.

*Fine. Okay, I started with that college student.*

Quinn Forsythe. Sophomore journalism major.

*I didn't know her name.*

Why did you choose her?

*Next was that private gumshoe. Is that what they're still called? Gumshoes? He had a name fitting for the job.*

Larry McGinness. Former beat cop turned blogger PI.

*That's the one. The next five varied in age, but I'm sure you saw a pattern.*

A pattern?

*Again, that's why I love young, local print journalists. Always trying to prove something.*

What are.. what would we try to...

*Prove? Maybe that you could crack the case. Maybe that this would be your big break.*

Alright fine. You've intrigued me, Terry. You're saying there are 8 victims -

*Will be.*

\- sure, fine. There will be 8 victims. If that's the case, if you really are the Remember Killer, how do you lure your victims in the first place?

Guide Me;77;4;"When I started to have nightmares, it wasn’t a surprise

&#x200B;

I was small, the house was big, and dad had gone away

&#x200B;

My mama tried to help but she was always just so tired

She worked real hard to give me everything I needed

A Guiltless Hunger;148;6;"The movies got it wrong of course -- those standard images of what a zombie outbreak would look like. When it started we didn't see the classic, slowly shambling corpses walking the streets moaning for brains. We didn't see those more modern ones either, with their screams of rage and sprinting hordes of approaching death.

There were no hordes at all actually. No mindless beasts, rotting flesh, or reanimated dead. 

No. The zombie virus wasn't the apocalyptic event of movie and television fame. It was slow, and secret. The virus was no science fiction plot device capable of some dark necromancy, it was exactly what it says on the label. A viral infection. It's well documented now of course, the creeping destruction of the anterior insular cortex and the altering of the hypothalamus. A slow process leaving behind something still quite human, alive, and intelligent, just lacking in empathy and with a taste for human flesh. 

Researchers think that it may have been around for decades before the recent spread. After all, even a sociopath with a taste for cannibalism knows that going out and biting people is a recipe for getting caught. They were smart generally, killing first before eating their fill. Serial killers both known and unknown. 

It was the ones that tried, you know. Tried not to give in. Tried to hold back the hunger past the point where they didn't care anymore -- out of memory of the times when they did. Those were the ones that spread it, taking bites out of the living when the urges got too strong.

The terror of the zombie outbreak wasn't watching the dead breaking down your doors. It was seeing your neighbor greet you with a friendly wave and wondering if their husband you hadn't seen in a week was chopped up in the freezer. It was watching the news as another black market butcher was taken down, cooler racks filled with meat that was very much not beef. It was wondering how far it had spread when the homeless populations across the country started dropping. It was covert looks at bosses and leaders that showed a few too many teeth when they smiled.

Now as you watch the live stream of the congressional debate you contemplate how many of those in charge have been affected. As they argue that the infected are still humans and still deserve rights you consider if those same infected might have decided there were better ways to feed their hunger than in secrecy, if only they had support from the right people. As the votes come in and the laws pass you know that this is only the beginning. 

That is the terror of the zombie virus. And as you absently rub your arm, you realize you just don't really care anymore.";16170841760
Better alternatives?;4;0;"I finally got the call that I was eligible for a COVID vaccine, and I cannot say how relieved I was. I don’t really want to go into it, but I have some health problems and this whole pandemic thing has scared the shit out of me, making me one of those “quarantine crazies.” So I put on my gloves, mask, face-shield and take a bottle of hand sanitizer and a long pause to catch my breath before getting into my car. Fifty minutes of driving later, I arrive.

The clinic is the next town over, out in the middle of nowhere. A friend of mine told me these small-town clinics are the best way to get a vaccine, because they run out of locals who are willing to take them. I fumble with my phone to call the number to let the clinic people know I have arrived, and a few minutes later I get a text letting me know I should enter via the front door. 

I take a breath to steady myself, as this is the first place, I have gone in in… months? It’s been so long, and it feels wrong to be afraid, but there in the pit of my stomach is a deep-seated fear of people.

I go to the front door and wince when an elderly woman comes out and holds the door open for me, while I take a step backwards. I feel terrible as she holds it open, keeping my 6 feet from her, but this has been my life for a year now. She leaves and I cautiously enter, to find a small waiting room with 4 chairs, and a crudely erected plexiglass barrier between me and the front desk lady. I check in and she gestures to one of the chairs, which smells of sanitizer and I sit and wait.

A bit later a nurse comes out with a tray, placing it on the table between us. “Okay u/DoctorNsara , as you know, we are testing a new vaccine here, and we thank you for your participation. This vaccine has a 99% efficacy rate in current trials of those who successfully complete the regimen.

She moves a few things around on the tray, but I see no needle. “I apologize though, as some are a bit squeamish with the methodology…” She says and uncaps a petri dish. Within are two small wriggling forms. “A single dose is all that is necessary to fully vaccinate you after a 96-hour period.” She says slowly, noting that my body recoils from the sight. “But if you do not take the live dose, you have to take a double dosage of the deceased medium.”

On the tray is a large glass of water and inside the dish are two shiny reddish earwigs, wriggling about. 

“It is 100% medically safe.” The Nurse says reassuringly as one snaps it’s pincers. Suddenly, I cannot swallow or even breathe, but is a vaccine worth it?";16171494400
The girl who wore many faces;174;9;"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, all right through until the end of the week, she'd have a different face for every day. She had a face to suit every mood and special occasion.


She didn't buy them or anything; she simply borrowed them, swiping a face here and there from unsuspecting people. But she never took the faces for long. She always brought them back to their owners. That was always promised. All she wanted was to try the face on for a little while.


She'd plaster the face on like a mask then enjoy the *feeling* of the borrowed skin, truly relishing the experience. She'd squish the cushy lips, grope the cheeks, caress the skin. Then she'd skip over to her bedroom mirror to admire the facial features, poring over each freckle, mole, wrinkle, or dimple, in awe. 


She'd test out different expressions and silly faces. But her favorite was tugging the ends of the lips upwards in a beaming smile. Each face had a unique, signature smile. That was something the faces helped with; getting her to smile.


Then she'd leave her home and take a walk outside, lifting her head up high and proudly, the same sweet smile plastered onto the new face. 


By the time it grew dark, she'd return home, then stand in front of her mirror and admire the face one more time before reluctantly peeling it off. Deep down she knew the face didn't truly belong to her and that she had to take it off.


Sometimes she'd glance for just a second into the mirror and the memories would come crashing down like relentless waves, invading her mind like a virulent disease. In that moment she'd remember her past, rapidly flitting across her vision as vivid images she could touch, see, and worst of all *feel* come to life. She'd once again feel the searing heat of flames ravage her body, she'd smell the dense cloud of black smoke choking her lungs, she'd hear the *sizzling* of skin being cooked.


After the accident a faery had taken pity upon her, the poor girl, and gifted unto her the ability to steal a face from any person of her choosing. But it was never enough.


As she gazed into the mirror at the blistered, scarred, charred lump of flesh sitting atop her neck, she longed to have her own face back. 


No stolen possession could replace what she'd lost, and every day she wished to trade all of the world's faces just to get her own back. ";16170743750
Clawfoot tub;55;5;"Offering my body to middle-aged men had become such an easy cash flow stream. They were all the same, slightly nervous and out of breath when they brought me to their place. Forming more than a few complete sentences was a difficult task as they drooled over me and prayed that I wasn’t an undercover cop. I had a nice gig going for a woman in her thirties, but then I met Tanner. 

Tanner surprised me. He was confident, clearly not his first time paying for the goods. But more interesting was his fascination with his clawfoot tub, a tub originally built by his great-great-grandfather. I’ll admit it, the tub was pristine enough to fool someone as being brand new. The cast iron feet with flower designs were beautiful and the white tub itself, didn’t have a chip in it. 

“Now, why don’t you go ahead and wash up and join me in the bedroom when you are done.  And try not to fall asleep. This tub has a way of relaxing you. It’s hard to resist.” Tanner left me with my glass of wine and headed to the room.

After about ten minutes in the tub, I nodded off. When I opened my eyes, I was in the tub, but not in the bathroom. I was outside near an old farmhouse. An older gentleman dragged a woman by her hair towards the tub. He plunged her head in the water and kept it submerged. 

“You are not pure! I must free you from your sickness, so you can no longer carry on with your lustful ways,” the man preached.

I sat there shivering, as I got a face full of death right before my eyes. I felt an arm tapping my shoulder. I jolted back awake in the bathroom. Tanner was sitting in a chair next to me. The tub, no longer white, flashed all around me like sparklers. 

“Cindy with an S, I must wash you of your sins. You didn’t think I would let you spread your disease to me, did you? You are not pure.” Tanner reached for my neck with both of his hands, shoving me under the water.

As I struggled to release his grip, I grabbed hold of the wine glass and smashed it against the wall. I took the shard and thrust it into his neck. He fell over and tended to his wound while I climbed out and ran out of the house. 

A neighbor gave me some clothes and called the cops. Tanner was arrested. The cops found several bodies buried in his backyard. All the deceased were former escorts. I don’t know what I experienced in that haunted tub when I was transported to a different time. What I do know is, that experience shook me enough to have me reconsider the line of work that I was in. And as for tubs, I’m sticking with showers from now on.";16170905960
It Wasn’t My Fault—the Ghost Possessed Me Twice;14;1;"Mom’s vase was lying in pieces at the bottom of the stairs.

I’d pushed it but I wasn’t to blame.

The ghost was the real culprit.

“Mom, listen to me! I pushed the vase only because there’s a ghost inside me…He made me do it!”

Before Mom said anything, the ghost suddenly jumped out of me and protested, “I’m not gonna take the blame! I took over his body only because someone performed that darn possession ritual in the basement last night!”

At that moment, the basement door burst open and an angry ritual full of possessions stormed out, wielding its altar, shouting, “don’t you blame it on me, filthy spook! I only summoned you under his mon’s command!”

Now it was Mom’s turn to flail her arms, “EXCUSEZ MOI?! I’m the LAST ONE anybody would blame! I did it only to protect my son; I want him to be declared mentally sick to avoid the death penalty when they come to take him away for all the WHORES he’s cleansed God’s Earth of!”

“Wait, what?!” I didn’t see this coming, but before an answer came, the front door crashed open and two cops rushed in guns-drawn.

Mom was still ranting against whores, the ghost was screeching like he was possessed, and the ritual was rapping about how “everybody’s gangsta until cops bust their door”.

Dumbfounded by the pandemonium, I stood still.

The cops pointed their guns at me and shouted “freeze”.

I heard one of them report to his walky-talky the suspect was in a daze mumbling gibberish, probably hallucinating.

He further reported there was a desiccated corpse lying on the bottom of the stairs, female judging from the clothing, possibly dropped there by the suspect.

I then looked there but only saw Mom running her tirade.

*There was no corpse, what the hell?*

Then the cops climbed up to me, handcuffed me, and started taking me outside.

They also reported the suspect looked almost identical to the witness’ sketches of the “Brookside Strangler”.

Weirdly, the words triggered memories.

I saw in sequence the faces of several young women turning purple, silent tears running down their cheeks, my reflection staring back in their imploring eyes, the tender fragrance of their bodies in my nostrils.

*Hmmm…*

*How sweet...*

*How seductive…*

*How WRONG…*

*Young women are succubae…*

*The worst of WHORES…*

*Mom told me so…*

*Talking about Mom, why isn’t she here to protect me?*

The cops were about to throw me in their cruiser.

Fortunately, the moment one of them touched my scalp, the screeching ghost shot out like an arrow and reentered my body.

A surge of inhuman strength washed over me.

I shook off the cop’s hold and tried to grab at her weapon even with my hands cuffed behind my back.

The other cop immediately aimed his weapon.

The last thing I remember is hearing a series of gunshots…";16171133520
Responding to Your Assumptions About Me;88;7;"Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel! To celebrate finally hitting the 100k subs milestone, I’m doing a long-requested livestream.

This afternoon, I’m gonna be responding to a bunch of your assumptions about myself. How much do you *really* know about Sasha411, your fave lifestyle YouTuber? I’ve already got a couple here to start, and the rest are gonna be coming in from the chat.

Let’s see…

*“You prefer vanilla ice cream to chocolate”*

False! Your girl loves kicking back with a pint of Belgian chocolate on a Friday night.

*“You were a C average kid in high school”*

Rude...kidding haha! I was actually a total bookworm in school though. Feels like ages ago.

*“You’re a completely different person off-camera than on-camera”*

Well, I wouldn’t say completely different. Maybe a little.

*“You’ve never done anything against the law before”*

Kinda putting me on the spot here, geez. Who hasn’t broken the law at least once, right?

*“You’re way stronger and more athletic than you look”*

Correct! Appearances can indeed be deceiving.

*“You’ve killed someone, that’s the illegal thing you did lol”*

...

Yes and no. Yes—in that I definitely have committed murder. No—in that it wasn’t just one person.

*“Omg! You’re just trolling us for attention right now, there’s no way you’ve killed people”*

To be fair, I guess I haven’t offered you any proof of what I’m saying. Allow me to provide some now...

*“Wtf?! You must’ve put on a monster costume, that’s gotta be special effects or something”*

Believe what you like, darling. Ignorance makes you easier prey for me.

*“You’re...some kind of demon”*

Now, we’re getting somewhere.

*“You’re immortal and can’t be killed”*

Nice guess. Many have tried and failed to slay me over the years. I’m tough to kill—but not immortal.

*“You feed off of humans somehow, consuming us makes you stronger”*

Gold star. Although, I do also relish hunting for sport.

*“Whatever. You can’t harm any of us anyway because you’re miles and miles away”*

The Darkness of the Night;6;2;"At night,

The darkness grows stronger.

It always grows bigger and disappears in the day.

It's goal is unknown to those who haven't experienced it.

But it always has the same plan.

It eventually grows bigger than you and anyone you know.

And then, it consumes you.

Dear reader,

You are it's next target.

Do not fight back.

Your doom is impending.

And your pain is eternal.

But how do I know these things?

My friend, I _am_ the darkness.

_And you're next_

_Worry not, friend_

_I will find you_

_I always do_";16171292830
THE TESTS;9;5;One day I was ordered by my renovating company to restore an old mental asylum, yeah I know Mental asylums are creepy in their own way, but I just threw my creepy thoughts aside and Went to restore the old asylum .the asylum was really old and looked like, that they were built during the 18th century. it was very old and dusty. as with any old abandoned asylum, it was very old that, the walls fell apart and everything was covered with spider webs. Even though all of this gave me the Creeps, I thought rationally and kept calm. We started the work, we first cleaned and destroyed the falling walls in the patient rooms. later the evening we decided to restore the old storage room in the basement. While we were cleaning, we found a bunch of rusty trunk boxes. we were very curious to know what was inside the box. we tried to find the keys to those boxes, but it was nowhere around. Then we decided to break the boxes. it was filled with old film rolls. On the top of the film boxes, the Names of various patients were written. we tried playing them with the film projectors we had. We knew that these tapes were hiding something bad. But to our surprise, the patient in the video was an old famous actor back in the days. Some of us even were able to recognize him . he looked like, he was out of his mind . the doctors were giving him some kind of shock therapy. his body shivered while they electrocuted him. it was really brutal to watch . the screams he made while they performed the test, still haunts me. And echos in my ears. The rest of the tapes had even further more documentation of the test that was made on him. we stopped mid-way through the tapes since it was too difficult to watch. Each and every test made on him was horrible and even getting worse as time went on. later we hit the internet and tried to find why he was admitted to the mental hospital. It was said that in his late 60s he was affected by amnesia and was starting to slowly forget, the roles he played, who he was. then his friends and family admitted him to the asylum in 1957. But the most horrifying part of the news was that there is a conspiracy that some of his friends and family wanted his money and wealth for themselves, so they planned to make him look like he had amnesia and he was mentally ill. And even paid the doctors to perform operations like shock therapy and make him really go mad.;16171155120

I did not kill a man when I was eight years old;4361;113;" My stepfather hated everything my mother loved. Not just me, or her hobbies, and hell, probably himself too, but everything that made her happy. But Apollo he hated more than anything.

 I was five when me and mom got Apollo, a skinny skittish puppy at the time. He was patient with me - toddlers aren't always nice - but he worshipped mom. The little I remember of that time was happiness.

 I was seven when that man moved in. He didn't tolerate happiness in the house. He kicked Apollo for being ""too loud"", and soon kicked me as well. After almost losing a finger, he learned not to hit us when Apollo was there. If he had known that I had noticed that he feared the dog, he would have beat me for noticing. He hated weakness, and it was always someone else's fault if he didn't like how he was feeling.

 After a while, he started ordering me to herd Apollo into another room and close the door when he wanted to beat my mother. Apollo would bark, howl and claw the door when it happened - the neighbours called animal protection three times, but never called the police.

 Some dogs can open doors. Apollo wasn't one of them.

 I did not kill a man when I was eight years old.

 All I did was open a door.";16169951030
I'm being stalked by a demon;2;5;"I’m being watched by demons

So, let me give context. When I was around 3 or 4, my mum told me that I used to “Talk to people” at midnight. They weren’t people. They were demon-like things. When I moved house, however, I only saw them every now and again. At my new school, I met a new friend. We’ll call him C. C saw the same things that I have explained. We were quite good friends, and still are today. Once, we were walking on a field past an old nursery. There was a rumour that a young girl had died when she went into a crawl space underneath the nursery. The day after, we walked past again, but thought we heard a faint cry. We looked into the crawl space, and the crying stopped. We checked again the next day, and saw what we thought to be a little girl. We had what we are going to call a flashback. We were on a train (1930s-1950s?) in formal clothing. We were with a little girl, who we have found out to be our younger sister. We were surrounded by passengers, who were just shadows. There was one girl we remember, however. She was extremely tall, and had red eyes and a pale, thin face. She had a straw hat on, and had bloodshot eyes. We looked outside. We were on a bridge. Out of nowhere, we heard an ear-shattering screech, like a banshee. All the windows smashed. A shard of glass pierced through our sister’s neck. We saw the train driver pull out a razor-sharp golden knife and a wooden handle. He ran out of the cabins, almost leaping towards our sister. He tried to stab her. As he was about to stab her, the train derailed and fell into a river below us. We saw our sister die with the glass shard in her neck, as her blood dropped into the water. The shadows were gone, and so was the woman. C was dead. The train driver had managed to stab him in the heart. I slowly began to drown, and as I nearly died, the train exploded, and we snapped back to reality. We spent the next few weeks speaking about it, and going back to the crawl space. Later that night, I saw our sister. She was in the corner of my room with a slit in her neck where the glass had entered her body. I tried to talk to her, but she just stared at me. I didn’t sleep that night. 

C told me he had a dream that he was in a dark void he saw a silhouette sprinting towards him growling and shrieking. Then an ear-splitting scream which broke him from the transe.

The next day was ok and we saw nothing weird . We were in class and the door was opening and closing by itself. All the doors and windows were closed. We asked our friend and he said he saw nothing apart from one L. She saw it and she saw a humanoid under the nursery which is very unusual. The reason I am posting this is because… the train driver is… back";16171423260
Taxi at Midnight;28;7;" Midnight. The sky is a black velvet curtain without moon or stars. The streetlamps are a halo of grainy light in the absolute darkness. Everything is blended together in one smooth mass, and my head throbs from trying to figure it out. I have been walking for what seems like hours, but I can't seem to find another living soul. At this hour, everybody's probably off to bed.

A smooth convertible melts out of the shadows and draws up besides me.

""Need a taxi?""

I nod gratefully, stepping inside. The car speeds off.

I slump into the soft leather seats, breathing a sigh of relief. It really is peaceful in here. Tall skyscrapers and rundown homes give way to beautiful open country, with great rolling fields and the occasional shadow of a cow.

Then I can see my house on the horizon, a solid white beast built of bricks, coming closer and closer. Yelling in joy, I announce that I'm home and for the driver to stop.

But the driver goes right on past. My house gradually shrinks, until it is just a dot on the horizon, then it vanishes altogether.

""Turn back!"" I shriek until my voice is hoarse but the words just bounce off his ears. Desperately, with no other choice, I feel around for the seatbelt buckle but can only feel smooth black leather. I try to slip under the seatbelts but it holds me fast; and the door is locked. Nothing seems to work.

""Do not struggle,"" comes the voice from the front. ""You will be there shortly.""

But where exactly is he taking me?

A hole opens up in the grassy pasture. The car begins its descent.

Icy fingers feel their way up my spine, and I can't help but shiver. All the beautiful open country is replaced by globs of earth. Further down are long strips of bones, some twisted at unnatural angles.

Finally, the car skids to a stop. The driver gets out, a tall figure cloaked in shadow and wearing a pair of white gloves. His face seems to distort under his cloak, twisting into a smile.

He beckons me to come out, then hands me a sheet of paper. My heart sinks further as I read every word. Memories flash through my mind. Abusing the cat, and then my brother at ten. Stealing money and killing the owner at twelve. It goes on and on. Up until that fateful night. The night when I lay on the tarmac after the crash, body twisted all over and lying in a pool of blood, wishing Death will come quick.

And now He has. He leans over me with a big smile.

""Did you enjoy the ride, my dear?"" He says cheerfully. ""Ooh, I can't wait to show you what I have in store in this special place!""";16170670070
Our kid started crying.;50;0;"I'm so... I'm so... what's the word? I can't even describe my feelings right now. Nervous, anxious, worried are all understatements. Her cries echoes through the room and inside my head. I pace back and forth as all I could do was wait.

Then the cries stop.

I walk inside and saw her smiling, tears flowing down her eyes, as she held our baby boy. I cannot contain the overflowing joy.  The only thing off about him is why isn't he crying? He looks calm. The doctors said they would need to run some tests to see if the baby's condition is good. I nod and slowly gave him the baby. 

We went out of the hospital a few days later with our baby boy. The drive back was a soft and peaceful trip, with my wife asleep and our son in her hands, looking out of the window. There's this strange feeling I feel around him, he's not crying, he's not asleep, he's just... there, looking out of the window. 

""Ka!"" he said, before a few moments later a car drove by us. 

*Weird.*

""Tra!"" he said, as we drove by a truck.

I'm surprised and astonished, he's a few days old and can speak? The weird thing about this is that he's still too small to even see what's ahead of us. It was dark outside and I can't even tell what vehicle comes next. 

Then after a few words, he cried. For the first time, as he went bawling his eyes out, kicking and punching everywhere. He woke her up and tried to calm him down. His loud noises kept me from focusing on the road.

The last thing I've seen and felt where two large headlights and a truck horn.

So this is what his cry means.";16170508850
The Entertainment;15;2;"Slap!

The pain seared through my left cheek, leaving it red and numb. I slowly woke up, boy, was I dizzy. My eyes began adapting to the pale orange light shining above my head, the light was flickering on and off as I blinked as if to tell me silently that its life was ending. The poorly lit walls softly reflected the light as water slowly dripped down onto the slightly flooded ground, plop, plop, plop; one drop after another. 

My hands were strapped behind the chair and my ankle to its legs. Something was crawling around my feet, soft, squishy, hairy, was that a tail?? And what exactly is that stench; that rotten stench puncturing my nose…is that…is that a door in the corner?? Where exactly was I?

“Here, pick one,” said a deep voice.

I was able to make out the shape of a man, around 6 foot 2, round at the belly, wearing dark sunglasses; in…a tuxedo? 

I blinked twice to conjure tears into my eyes so that I could see clearer. As my surroundings started to come into focus, I felt a presence walking around me in circles, it must be the man. I shook my head lightly to get rid of the thoughts clouding my mind and looked down upon the table at my choices: a flat rectangular piece of metal with blades on all four sides, a double sided axe connected by a plate of metal in the middle, and a needle with some type of liquid inside.

“I…*cough, cough*,” was all I could wheeze out by opening my mouth.

“Do you want a drink of water child?” he asked. 

I nodded frantically in reply. I was appalled at what he did next, he bent down, scooped the water from the ground with his hands and forced it against my mouth.

“Drink up.”

The water tasted revolting, it smelled of garbage and sewer rats. Each sip I took tasted like blended worm juice, with dregs that blocked the pathway belonging to my throat. One sip after another was torture, and for every mouthful I spit out, the man started laughing menacingly. I tried shutting my mouth, but he just kept forcing the water into me, till the very last drop.

“Now, now little princess,” the man continued to say, “You’ve had your water, anything else you desire? Oops wait you have a little thing here at the side of your mouth~” The man used his fingers to pull out a long threadlike object from my mouth, I didn’t even dare ask what it was.

“*cough* what am I doing here…” I wheezed.

“My, oh my, the wittle pwincess wants to know why she’s here~” the man said in a sing song voice. 

Next thing I knew, he violently grabbed me by my chin and said, “You’re my entertainment for tonight.”";16170721510
Bloody Souls;2;0; “My parents had left the house half an hour ago, it was Halloween and they were taking my little sister and brother to go get candy from our neighbours. I was bored so I turned on the TV. Dad was watching the news before they left so I caught a glimpse of it before I changed the channel. I saw that the top report was a murderer in our area. I was always a bit paranoid so I locked all the doors and windows before I sat down again. That’s when I heard it. A knocking sound coming from my bedroom. I have always believed in the paranormal and the knocking sounded pleading. I knew someone or something needed my help. I walked slowly up the creaky stairs and heard shuffling of feet behind me. It was my sister. She laughed and went upstairs. I followed. Upstairs I saw my brother, smiling gleefully. I asked them what was wrong, they didn’t reply. They walked to the bathroom upstairs and I saw something, my parents. The tub was dark red and they were lying face down. I looked, terrified. I wanted to stop but every time I tried my siblings would force me to keep looking. I realized that I was next. That’s why I’m warning you. You’re next. My siblings are the murderers, not some creepy old man. They know you are here, and they know I’m talking to you. They can hear and see everything. They can taste fear. They glory in other peoples’ pain. They are coming. I only hope that now you know your fate, you won’t run from it. They love playing with their food before they eat it. Give them the least satisfaction possible when they do kill you. Do you want to be someone else’s toy? They will kill you, and they will do it soon. They are climbing up the stairs. I warn you, and you must warn others when you are gone.” The teen girl’s voice drifted away as I heard a door close behind me. *She warned me, and I must warn their other victims,* was my final living thought as my soul was ripped from my body as an act of the bloody knife the siblings hadn’t even bothered to clean.;16171092220

The Train;8;2;"He woke up. In the middle of a dark, fog shrouded forest, surrounded by tall, darkness filled trees. As he started walking, he heard voices which he could not understand. Suddenly, he felt a sensation,like something kicked him. He fell hard on the ground, unbeknownst to him what had hit him. He kept on walking more and more, more voices kept whispering in his ear, some of which he could understand. ""Now!"", ""my God"", ""help him"", echoed through his head. In the distance, he saw a rail, abandoned for who knows howmany months. As he walked, the forest became darker, foggier, and one could say, sentient. He felt a kick again, but it was much harder this time. He lept from the ground and with much effort, continued his journey. As he approached the rail, a train started passing by, a train he could almost recognize. Everything around him was completely shrouded in dark now, and the voices became louder and clearer. ""We're losing him!"", ""Don't cry"", ""More blood!"", ""Keep the pressure!"". One voice became a thousand, the pain almost unbearable, and the train went on fire. In the midst of it all, the train finally passed, the pain stopped, and voices went silent. Only thing that echoed through his ears was ""Time of death, 11:09"", followed by a soft cry.";16170719660

Just trying to liven up Barry's day;10;1;"Barry use to be so happy and cheerful. I work in a residential building and Barry was a resident who always use to say hello and smiled quite a lot. The last couple of months Barry has been rather miserable and just not himself really. I am a concierge and I see many people within the building I work and every walk of life comes up to me and I do my best to help them. I use to enjoy seeing Barry coming down into the reception and now he just walks by. I wondered so many times at what must have been wrong with Barry? 

Then it hit me Barry must be experiencing ground hog day and his day just keeps on repeating. He must have said hello to me so many times and now that he is just miserable because the same thing keeps happening. No wonder he is so miserable now and even the nicest person can turn horrible if the same thing kept on happening  over and over again, it will eat your mind. So I decided to brighten Barry's ground hog day by doing random things. Like trashing the communal areas and if Barry sees something that is out of common place, the randomness might excite him a little and stimulate his mental being. 

I then allowed a thug to graffiti the residential building to make Barry's ground hog day a bit different. I was doing something new to the residential building that wasn't supposed to be, to add a bit of different and new to Barrys day that he is reliving everyday. Barry never took notice nor did he care and I felt a little hurt by that and I went up to him and I told him ""I know that you are reliving the same day everyday which has made you miserable and so I decided to do something different to make your day a bit more exciting."" I said and I listed a few things that I had done to make his ground hog day a bit better. 

He looked confused and replied ""ground hog day? Erm I just lost my job, girlfriend and my family are just greedy ass holes"" 

""No need to deny it"" I told him and I took out my gun and shot my co-worker to make his ground hog day a bit more exciting. I mean my co-worker will come back to life as the day will restart and I can do other things to him to make Barry's constant replaying day more exciting.";16170639800

""Please let me go,"" he begs with a quivering voice. ""I'll give you anything you want girl.""


""Oh but I already have what I want; a new babysitter to play with. My new toy,"" she grins.


And so, Luna and the man go at it for hours playing her favorite game. She makes him do hundreds of tricks: somersaults, flips, ballerina twirls, statue poses. 


He doesn't seem to like the game, and continuously hurls colorful insults at Luna: devil spawn, vile child, little witch. He goes so far as to spit at her feet and threaten to tattle to her parents about her behaviour.


Luna purses her lips, and knots her brows in annoyance from his protests. She then comes up with the perfect solution to get some silence. 


""Simon says shut up.""


And with those simple words his mouth clams up tightly like a shell, unable to open.


After a while, Luna finally tires of her playtime, stares blankly at the man and sighs.

""Does this mean we're done?""


""Mhm. Yup. I've had enough fun. I'm done with you.""


He smiles with relief, believing she's about to release him from her curse. 


With an ear to ear grin, Luna opens her mouth to speak.


""Simon says...stop breathing.""


As the man clutches his constricting throat, wheezing for air, and turning blue in the face, Luna casually strolls away. She stops when she gets to the bedroom doorway, then speaks over her shoulder.

“Where’d that guy come from?” Mr. Lanky asked anxiously, his spindly fingers slowly wrapping around his own throat. He used to do that when he was scared, Mr. Lanky. Choke himself to death.

“I...don’t know,” I answered, staring at the man sitting in Lovely Lara’s spot. His smooth oval face glistened in the dark, thick oozing gashes covering the parts where’d you’d expect the skull to collapse inwards. “I didn’t summon him.”

“He’s weird,” Croix murmured, shedding his/her nervous skin, bloody piles of the stuff already filling the floor. “I don’t like weird.”

I shuffled to my feet, waving my finger around threateningly. “Hey, guy,” I said. “You’re not invited. Please leave.”

;)

“Wh-where did Lovely Lara go?” Croix whispered, his/her bare flesh now crawling with tiny maggots. “Wha-what did he do to her?”

The guy just sat there, his one good eye unmoving, that freaky grin resting on his lumpy face-body without a care in the world. I swallowed deeply, and quickly found my seat again.

“Guh,” Mr. Lanky coughed hideously, spindly fingers now buried deep into his throat. “Gah, wh-what is happening?”

I felt my brain pulsating then, like a black bloated slug creeping up your wall while you’re sleeping, readying itself to drop down in your mouth and lay a million eggs in your lungs. It will die in your lungs, you know. Tear open and bleed out. That’s why you cough up all that slime and goo in the morning.

Mr. Lanky convulsed on the floor. I’d never seen him do that before. His unbelievably thin frame spasming grotesquely, blood and guts and organs squeezing out from every orifice.

“Lanky!” Croix shrieked. “Puh-please, you have to do something Patricia.”

“This is you, isn’t it?” I screamed at the man. “You’re doing this. Stop it this instant!”

Mr. Lanky shook and trembled for what felt like years, but it was probably longer. His flesh morphed and transformed, like when you make a face in your minced meat, until he was no longer Mr. Lanky. Then he suddenly got up and winked at me.

Croix tried to leave then, but he/she had no skin, so he/she slipped on his/her extended maggot family, and came apart in a slushie of melted meat-juices once he/she hit the floor. I wanted to scoop him/her up with my hands and consume him/her once more, but they wouldn’t let me.

Instead they did the thing with Croix too. Slowly his/her remains morphed and transformed, jelly-shaking tissue and sinew rapidly forming another one of them.

“W-why?” I asked. “Why did you do that to my friends?”

I don’t remember what they said, but it made sense. Perfect sense. And then I guess I fell asleep.

“Patricia!” my father’s harsh voice woke me. “Get your fucking toys sorted, you fucking useless shit, or you’ll soon have *two* black eyes.”

Under;701;30;"Have you ever felt, in the middle of doing something, that you were in the wrong place? That somehow, you’d ended up in another person’s home, or on the wrong street, even though you knew you were in the right place a second ago? The moment always passes, but just for an instant, you were in the Under.

It’s a place just like the First. All the houses are the same. The forests are a little denser but we don’t have enough time to get into that. The only major difference is that this isn’t a place for humans – except for me, and if your luck isn’t very good, you too.

You might find yourself being pulled into the Under more often as time passes. The more it happens, the longer you stay there. Then one day you’ll find that you can’t go back to the First.

When that happens, quickly find a place with multiple exits. Make sure it’s well-lit and not too spacious. When they come to you, leave the room quickly and make your way to the Inn. You’ll know which one I’m talking about because all roads in the Under lead to the same place. Don’t come through the front door, there’s a broken window that’s a safe entry point as long as you don’t cut yourself on the glass. Of course, we don’t know whether the Things even have their senses of smell anymore, but it’s worth a shot. That’s how *I* escaped.

As soon as you’re inside the Inn, you’re safe. Not always, obviously. Not when you get hungry. But you’re safe, and you’re not alone anymore. I’ll be waiting in the first room on the left.

I have so much more to tell you about the Under. I’ll teach you how to avoid the Things when we search for food and how to use the device that brought both of us down here. It’s going to be so fun having someone around after all these years.";16169618140
Do You Wanna Hear a Joke?;50;3;"I was talking with my roommate Eric, small guy, red head and big teeth, when I told him it was my birthday. So I asked him if he wanted to have a party, just me and him.

His mother always told him to stay away from strangers-  no matter what. So I knew he wouldn’t open up at first, but he’s lived with me for about 3 months now. I though it would be good to get to know him better, and since it was my birthday, maybe he would finally open up. 

He said yes, which to be honest, I didn’t expect. Hell, I had a whole speech prepared about why we should go crazy and just have fun, but he just said “sure” the second I asked him. I guess he wants to be friends after living here so long.

So later that night I buy some beer and get some weed, and we have a great time. He tells me about his love for cooking, his favorite shows and movies, and how much he loves to hear jokes, even if their bad. But eventually things get a bit more... personal. Actually, a lot more personal.

Eric tells me about the day his mother died. How his mother was choked to death with a red chain. How he was hiding under the bed when his mother was killed. And How the killer sounded like someone he knew. But he could never tell who. Actually, he said that’s why he’s rarely talked to me, because he was afraid I was the killer.

I immediately started laughing my ass off! It was the funniest shit I’d heard all year. When he asked what’s so funny, I pulled out the chain under my couch, and asked him-

Do you wanna hear a joke?";16170100960
Where Did They Go;2;0;"Me and my roommate have never been close. She shies away during the day, and only appears at night. Whenever there are other people, she always hides away.
She headed towards the stairwell door, which led to the house basement. 

One day, she peered into my room, and greeted me with a toothy smile. She whispered softly: ""I know what you're missing."" 

I shuddered:""What is it?""

She grinned wider:""come, I'll show you,""

Beckoning with a finger, she led me down the hallway. Down the stairs, the stair knob winced uncomfortably in her right hand as she pranced into a sharp turn.

Her slit-pupiled eyes still locked onto my face, grinning.
I followed suit, hands shaking. 

Down in the basement, my eyes adjusted to the darkness. I could see a glimmer of her teeth, offering a weak signal to come closer in the dark.

With every step forward, her eyes gave a mischievous glint in the dark, her smile stretched wider, cutting into a stretched shadow with the glow of her screen 

She tapped a long dirt-filled nail on her screen. 

My phone buzzed.

Fishing out my phone, I unlocked it nervously, and viewed her text.

There were a few pictures. A scroll of them, all of them set in many different places: the bar, the park, the beach... 

All of them centered on one woman, smiling. 

That smile, that woman... 

 I looked up, and saw a mirror.

Two empty eyes stared back, a thin lined nose, lips, gums... 

I tried to scream. But there was no sound.

Where did they go?";16170588800
Silver;38;6;"During my time as a journalist and writer, I found myself aboard *The Rurik* a few times.

It was an ill-fated voyage, the captain fiercely superstitious, the crew sullen and taciturn, and the ship itself trembling along the grey waves of Vladivostok's shores, creaking as if it could crumble at any second.

We left for the Sea of Japan on a dim day, heading into a scarlet sunrise that made Kapitan less than optimistic about our future. Of all the strange tales and legends Kapitan shared with me, one struck me as out of place. All his other stories have their roots in Slavic myths, no doubt influenced by the sailors of Vladivostok, yet he often spoke of a silver sea that he saw as a child - roiling waves glistening like white gems under the sun, afar in the distance where the sapphire blue fades. A myth I was never able to link an origin to.

""Last thing my grandfather ever saw."" He warned, pointing to the sea, ""The stench follows those waves, then it kills you.""

I wanted to ask if it was some kind of algae, or perhaps just the sun in his eyes, but he fervently denied these possibilities. *His father saw it too, and his grandfather*, he insisted staunchly as he smoked his bitter Turkish tobacco.

Our original path was to pass through the Northern Sea Route, go up near Kamchatka and through the Bering Strait, but Kapitan seemed hesitant: he did not want to scuffle with the towering military ships that have been loitering in those waters, and we ended up circling away farther than expected.

It was on the fifth day of the voyage that the elusive silver sea appeared. Kapitan pointed at the waves shining under the sun, reflecting off its light like scattered diamonds. I was mesmerized by its undulating shape for a second, uncertain of what I was seeing - the silver seemed to stretch on for acres.

Then the stench hit me. Foul, rotten brine that rose from the ocean and choked my breath in my lungs. Kapitan ordered the ship to speed away from the white sea, leaving it far behind.

I took one last look at the waves in the distance, and a revelation struck me.

Thousands, perhaps millions of dead sardines floated in the ocean. Their smooth silver bodies glistened in the light of the day. Their half-decomposed corpses emanated the suffocating stench.

The military has been testing nerve agents in those waters for decades, releasing toxic gas into the ocean. The silver sea that Kapitan saw was the aftermath of chemical warfare. And undoubtedly, his grandfather's last breaths were filled with the same poisonous, deadly air.";16170065610
This is the only way I can see my girlfriend;165;11;"My girlfriend (Hannah) works in a hospital as a surgeon and she is so busy and it's hard to see each other. So we do what we both can to see each other. When my girlfriend wants to see me and the same with me, I straight away get myself hurt. I broke my arm a couple of months ago and as I got sent to hospital my girlfriend stitched me all up and mended my broken bone. It was so wonderful to see each other. It's unfortunate but it's the best we can do right now. 

Then a couple of weeks later my girlfriend (Josephine) wanted to see me and being a nurse is so hard. A nurse is always so busy and hardly gets any break at all. I hadn't seen Josephine in a long time and so I got myself into a car crash and I awoke to find Josephine mending me and comforting me. It was so wonderful and better than any date I have ever had. We talked and laughed and I was so glad to be alive. Josephine is such a wonderful person and I'm glad that she is in my life. 

Then a couple of weeks later my girlfriend (sophie) wanted to see me. She is a doctor and is so busy dealing with so many patients. She was so desperate to see me and so I got myself stabbed by some crazy guy and I ended up in hospital where Sophie was checking up on me. It was so wonderful it truly was and I was so glad that we know each other. I was going to be fine and it was totally worth it to get stabbed so that I could see Sophie. 

Then a couple of weeks later all 3 of my girlfriends that I am secretly seeing in the same hospital, they all texted me that they so desperately wanted to see me. I have decided to blow myself up with a bomb, so each of them can see a bit of me. That was their suggestion not mine and I feel it would be so romantic.";16169687640
The truth;37;3;Hi, for legal reasons I am unable to reveal my identity. I am here to tell you the truth about NASA. Back in the 40’s my grandfather was one of the first members of the NMRT aka The National Marine Research Team. His rank cannot be disclosed but he had a senior role within the company. The NMRT had one goal and one goal only, to uncover every secret of the ocean. After their initial opening the corporation began sending countless submarines to the depths of the ocean, hoping to find something, anything of interest. Many things were discovered over the 4 years the company ran for but nothing of considerable interest. It wasn’t until submarine M-22 made contact with the land, that the team began to worry. Several seconds of panicked screaming could be heard through the communication device from inside the submarine. The screams abruptly stopped and were replaced by the fuzzing noise of the damaged equipment. The chief of the corporation retired to a private room where he watched the footage from submarine M-22. He never revealed what he saw on that footage but what he did do was change the corporations name to NASA in 1958 and spent every waking moment of his life looking for ways to get off of this planet. It is still unknown what was on that footage as the chief had destroyed it moments after watching, but it must have been something bad to scare a man so much into dreading being on this planet at all.;16169978610
Happy day;9;4;"Where do I even begin...

I woke one morning and found that the weather today was rather lovely. Bright shining sun, blue clear sky's and green grass. Warm but not hot. I went outside on my way to work but made a startling discovery. 

There was some kind of...voice. It was neither male or female. It was coming out of the sky. It was singing. I couldn't understand what it was saying. It was just unintelligible sounds but it was definitely singing. 

I noticed the majority if people had their jaws torn open, black ooze pouring out. Their eye sockets were empty as well. Masses of people were just...floating up into the air. Towards the voice. They would stand completely still for some time before flying off. Hundreds if not thousands of people were suspended in the air hovering above me. 

I went down to the gas station. It was full of other ""survivors"". They were just as confused as I was. We talked for hours about what could be going on but none of us had a clue. Eventually it started getting dark out and I went home just down the road. I could still see the station from my window. The other ""survivors"" remained at the station for the night. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to screaming.

I saw from window as those things broke into the gas station. They resembled tall humanoids covered in black ooze with long hair obscuring their face. They had long fingers with razor sharp claws no doubt capable of cutting through human flesh. I saw in horror as they massacred the survivors. Screaming about how they should have joined the bee hive and embraced the love. The next morning I went to the gas station and saw the aftermath. The (former) survivors were torn to pieces. Partially eaten. 

Now here I am. The singing is continuing. People keep floating away into who knows where. Night has fallen. I hear those things racing around my house, growling and roaring. I can see glowing red eyes staring at me from right outside my window.";16170235250
My Navajo grandfather's account of the Sleeping Grounds;52;2;"&nbsp;
My grandfather Winter escaped his reservation during America's first great depression when he was 15. He wandered West, working odd jobs and riding the lumber trains. Winter made friends with people we would call hobos today and was a shameless self-proclaimed hobo; he said their brotherhood of hobos looked after each other better than governments or families could. They pooled money to have small parties for the holidays, they made sure no one went hungry and they whistled like birds to discretely wake each other if one saw a railroad bull coming. Even years later, my Grandfather would snap out of a nap if a bird sung nearby. 

&nbsp;
The brotherhood got off in Washington to work a few weeks as hands at a logging camp before continuing to Canada. That is where Winter encountered the Sleeping Grounds. 

&nbsp;
It was early December and daytime temps in the mountains never rose above freezing. After hiking all day, the hobo brotherhood discovered that the logging camps they intended to work at were abandoned last Spring, and all that was left were the sleeping skeletons of a few log cabins. It was almost dark by the time they arrived, so they decided to scavenge for loose materials to build a temporary shelter for the night. My grandfather was part of the group sent to go into the woods to look for firewood. 

&nbsp;
Winter did not have much luck finding anything beyond a few twigs in the stripped woods around the camp and was forced to go deeper into the woods to take advantage of what little daylight he had left. But Winter became lost almost as soon as he went into woods; he was from New Mexico, and had no experience hiking in mountain forests. He yelled for help, but his words seemed muffled. 

&nbsp;
He saw only one thing in the darkness: a campfire. Winter went to it and discovered a clearing with an open canvas tent and a bed made of animal furs. My grandfather spared no detail describing the beautiful nude native woman lying on animal skins by the fire. She told Winter to undress and get into bed with her. My grandfather, being 18 at this time, did so before she finished speaking. 

&nbsp;
My grandfather said that those moments resting by the woman next to the roaring fire were the most serene and peaceful of his life. Then he heard a bird sing- it was the hobo's warning call, something rooted deeply in Winter's unconsciousness by now. Winter doubted that anything else could have reached him from the Sleeping Grounds, not even gunshots. 

&nbsp;
My grandfather woke up at dawn, half buried in a snow bank with frostbite over half his body. He looked around to see his friends frantically whistling, trying to wake him before he fell asleep permanently in the snow. 

&nbsp;
They found Winter in a field of animal and human bones. All of the still intact skeletons were in sleeping positions.";16169820640
The Return of Bobby Roberts;21;1;"Mrs. Hilary Roberts was watching an old Cary Grant film when the programme was interrupted. The channel zigzagged for a bit, the picture resumed and Cary turned to look at her.

""Are you there, Mrs. Roberts?"" The actor asked.

Hilary put her coffee down and looked around, expecting… well, she wasn't sure.

""Don't be frightened. I have something for you: your son, Robert.""

Bobby had disappeared thirty-five years ago. She went to pick him up from school that day but he wasn't there. The teacher couldn't explain it as her son had been in class only ten minutes previously.

The town searched. The police searched. Strangers searched. The nearby base helped search.

Suspicion fell on certain pupils. Then the teacher. Then Hilary. Then her husband, Bob. Nothing. Robert John Roberts was never found.

The image on the screen asked if Hilary had heard what he said. She nodded and then burst into tears.

""This isn't funny. Go away!"" She screamed.

""It's true, Mrs. Roberts. We took him. We gave him his wish,"" Cary smiled proudly. ""We have always looked after him. Made sure he was prepared for every adventure.""

His wish. Bobby loved space travel. He was obsessed with shows about spaceships, starships, outer space and intergalactic adventuring. She and Bob had been saving the money to take him to NASA. They were even going to take the special lunch offer, the one with the astronaut.

Cary Grant smiled. ""We have shown him amazing things. Objects that your people haven't yet discovered. Phenomenon that only comes every million years. Your son has travelled through the depths of dark matter and the highs of photonic birth channels.""

Hilary wiped her face with her hand. ""What about me? Did you think about me? You stole my son. You wasted my life.""

Mr. Grant accepted the charge. ""For that we are sorry. We regret some of our miscalculations in regards to time. This is why we have brought him home to you. He is always asking about you.""

Hilary stood up. ""Where is he? Where's Bobby?""

Cary smiled again. ""In the blue bedroom. Be quick. We need to go soon.""

Mrs. Roberts hesitantly made her way to her son's old bedroom. She could hear his voice inside calling out for her.

She tentatively pushed the door open, fearing this was some horrible joke. She had read about the cruelty of social media pranksters and other modern ways of tricking people.

""Bobby?""

When the kidnappers had informed her that they had prepared him in order to travel through space, she now understood what they meant.

On the bed sprawled her son. He was a fusion of reconfigured flesh and bone. His body had been stretched or shrunk in various directions. Body parts she didn't recognise as even being human had been adapted to fit his frame.

Hilary glared at her poor boy. He was in obvious discomfort.

""Help me, Mummy!"" Bobby pleaded in his seven year old voice. ""I don't want to go back!""";16169989570
Silver Witness;325;14;"Its 1:00 AM. I was walking down the streets of New York. No one in sight. Just me and the moon. As I walked farther down I see a man. A tall man. In a black trench coat, covering his face. He is walking in my direction. I look down, trying to walk past him without making any eye contact. As I get closer I notice a silver watch on his wrist. He starts to pull something from his pocket. All of a sudden, I’m shot. I fall to the ground. My ears are ringing. My chest starts turning red. The man starts feeling for anything valuable on me. He takes items from my pockets. The man then stands up. He runs away. As I lie on the ground bleeding, my vision goes blurry. I pass out

I wake up in a hospital. My chest hurts. And my head. A knock on the door. A doctor walks in. He introduces himself to me. He starts talking about what happened to me. I zone out. He then puts his hand out for a shake. I do the same. I then notice a silver watch on his wrist.";16169454720
Beat The Heat;17;2;"I’ve always had this itch in the back of mind that my baths were never hot enough. Each time they get a bit hotter. I test the waters so to speak. I turn the hot and cold taps on. I adjust the temperature to what I think is right. I get in and my skin turns bright red. There’s steam everywhere. But it doesn’t feel hot enough. 
The next time I turn just the hot water on. I wait and watch as the bath fills with steaming water. When I sit down my skin tingles and starts to peel. But it doesn’t feel hot enough. 
A couple days later I wake up and get a large pot. I fill it with hot water and put it on the stove. I turn the heat all the way up. It eventually starts boiling and I bring it to the bathroom. I dump it in the tub. I sit in it. It’s steaming. Singeing my skin. It blisters and pops. But it doesn’t feel hot enough. 
A week later I sit in my bed. Wishing I could find something hot enough to cure my itch. I sit up suddenly. I can think of one thing that might do it. Now that I sit in this pool of lava. My skin melting from my bones. It feels hot enough.";16169923170

&#x200B;

Exactly at noon the teacher’s black video box flashed back into life as a close-up, live-view of her face. Not that I was complaining, shit all the students loved Ms. Jones, but especially us Rad Dudes. The whole thing started when Jeremy Fink had the genius idea to create a private chat room so we could all talk together, but secretly. We named the chatroom after us rad dudes. After a while it became boring with the same stupid memes everyday, so we opened it up to the entire class. Even girls. They turned out to be pretty rad too. It was the best idea Fink’s ever had, even though I actually figured out it was possible to do. Not that it matters, or the fact that Fink has a KD ratio so small he has to use his grandpa’s glasses to find… 

&#x200B;

“Welcome back my amazingly wonderful students!” said Ms. Jones, beaming into the camera with a huge smile. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes, it felt like she was sitting right here next to me.

&#x200B;

“Thank you all for being so flexible and having an early lunch so Marky could get his very important medical scan.” 

&#x200B;

raddude10: HAHA MARKY

raddude11: marky markk

raddude11: did they find ur aimbot in there this time?

raddude12: lol stfu -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-

&#x200B;

“Let’s get started with the second part of today’s lecture. Everything you need was explained in the video we watched before lunch. And if you can’t remember the answer, don’t worry, we’re gonna work on it together like a big happy family.”

&#x200B;

raddude12: omg did anyone actually pay attention

raddude10: rip 

raddude12: damn..a

&#x200B;

 “Can anyone tell me why bird’s lungs are so special?” said Ms. Jones with an inspiring look of awe. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

  The next part of the story happened so fast it’s difficult to describe in the level of detail it deserves. The last thing I remember was seeing Ms. Jones glowing face looking at me, not at the class, or through the camera, but right at me, like she was here. And she said, “Now don’t you worry child, everything is going to be okay.” 

&#x200B;

Then everything went dark.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t see what happened next in my hospital room, but felt the presence of many caring helpers who arrived to save me. Could feel their tiredness and fear, as if already pushed to the limits of their very own beings, still fighting with everything they had to save me. 

&#x200B;

Who am I anyway? Am I even worth saving.

&#x200B;

“When was the last epi?!” 

“17 seconds until next” 

“Continue compressions”

“Does anyone have anything else to add?”

“Look on this window you can see the ventricle blowing out..” 

“Another 3 minutes now. Total code time 150 minutes.”

“Give the next epi, if nothing after this round… we’re going to call it. If anyone has objections, please speak them now.”

&#x200B;

3 minutes later. 

&#x200B;

“Anything?”

Predator of the Swamp;23;4;"There was a little boy named Stinky Steve who lived in a house in the midst of a sleepy swamp. He roamed the marshy grounds with a pointy stick, picking at the muddy undergrowth wherever he went. Looking for frogs, insects and whatever little pests he could get his hands on. 

After skewering through the swamp's little ecosystem, he made a garland of its corpses. Adorning the garland like a prized souvenir, he marched through the swamp with the march of an apex predator. He sang loud and proud, as the remaining little mammals scurried beneath their muddy homes. You see, they weren't afraid of Stinky Steve; they never were. 'Cause he wasn't the apex predator that he thought himself to be.

He marched and sang still, garland around his neck, stick in his hand. As he did, a distinct bubbling slowly arose from beneath the swamp waters.
Two sideways blinking eyes rose along with a toothy snout.
As he saw the boy thumping and singing, the croc bared his lethal grin.
The predator is finally home, and hungry.";16169712910
It should've been a nice night.;11;1;"The girl wrapped herself in a fluffy blanket and nibbled on some weed chocolate. She was a light weight so it wasn't long before the effects began to take hold. 

The chocolate made her feel warm and relaxed. She settled into the couch and scrolled through reddit admiring the cute animals that were displayed periodically. 

*tap*, *tap*, *tap*

Her body tensed and her pulse increased with alarm. She was certain that was the bathroom window. Someone was in the backyard...

She was very high and very alone. At first she stayed frozen on the couch listening intently for the slightest sound. 

A terrible screeching and scratching broke the stillness. 

Her focus was now on the back sliding door. He stood behind it with a knife down at his side. 

He pressed his face to the glass, ""I only want to talk to you"", his voice barely audible.";16169824510
Birth of the senses;13;3;"He huddled in the corner of his silent and pitch black world and suckled at the nutrition drip.

His useless, unfocused eyes gazed lazily into the darkness. His face carried no emotion, no recognition. Not a single spark of cognition.

He simply sucked at the tube and stared into the empty.

His posture was relaxed, his physique bent and his fingers and forearms curled in atrophy from years of inactivity.

In the adjacent room, they monitored his brain waves- and registered about as much neural activity as they’d charted on the lizards during a feeding.

Today was the day they’d introduce stimuli. 

The lead researcher pressed a command on the viewing console. A soft chirping sound Emirates through the isolation chamber. 

8 different viewing screens showed multiple angles of grainy infrared video: the man opened his eyes wide,  wrapped his dangling arms around his knees, and fell to the floor shaking and grunting. 

The researcher silenced the chirping and they all watched the subject- his mouth gaped but no intelligible sound came out. The neural imaging showed a cluster of activity indicating panic- even terror.

They saw tears on his face.

“Incredible.” The lead researcher stared at the monitor as he spoke to his colleagues, “truly incredible. The low decibel stimuli shocked his system so bad he’s having an anxiety attack. Let’s turn on the lights and open the shutters.”";16169782080
Run;64;0;"Every day for the last two years, he had been in this same hallway. The cold ashen walls and the blinding light that emanated from the ceiling were all too familiar. There was an elevator at the end of the corridor; its darkened doors glistened menacingly from where he stood. That menace was magnetic.

Pulling his jacket closer, Hunter began to walk down the straight path that leads to it. He knew exactly what would happen once he reached the penultimate door on the way to his objective, but he knew that he had to trigger it to stand a chance. The heavy steps that he took resonated and echoed around the narrow hallway before going quiet. 

His heart rate shot up as he stood but two steps from the brown wooden door. It looked heavy. 

Though he had died through this nearly 800 times already, there was nothing that could ready him for what was about to happen next. He took a deep breath, scanning the grey walls and touched the one that was to his left. The wall seemed to be biting at him, transferring the cold to his body. 

He took the two steps that he had to.

The door in front of him was kicked off its hinges. It was about ten feet long; Hunter knew that- he had once calculated how high the ceiling of the hallway was, and by extension that of the mysterious entity that stands in front of him. It had to walk on all fours to get into the corridor. Its eyes are hollow, set deep in the convex skull that makes up its face. You can barely distinguish between the sclera, the pupil, and the iris. Those dark and violet eyes set themselves on Hunter again.

There is barely any place to manoeuvre- each of its legs, a trunk. He did something that seldom works and tried to slide between the trunks. Surprisingly, it worked. Hunter quickly stood up and began to run down the corridor to the glistening doors that awaited him at its end. 

He knew that it could not turn around quickly in the limited space. It would take at least ten seconds to turn around and dart towards him. Without slowing his pace, Hunter removed his thick polyester jacket and threw it at the call button. The sound of the heavy zipper connecting with the single button on the metal panel is drowned by the storm approaching from behind. He dared not look back. 

The corridor warps. He is about fifty feet from the open doors now. 

Faster!

Forty. 

Thirty. 

The rumbling gets closer.

Twenty. 

Quicker!

Ten. 

He can feel the furnace and its warm, pungent breath now.

Eight. Now he feels pain. 

He flings himself forward, in the hopes of landing inside the metal box. About three feet separate him from solace still. 

His shaky fingers run along his back. Blood glistens well under bright lights.

Perhaps tomorrow, victory.

Now, death.

Wake up.";16169479750
I Wish my Parachute Failed;298;8;"When my parachute released during my freefall, I was relieved. Looking back now, I wish I plummeted to my death instead.

…

In order to help survivors, the government began to parachute them into safe zones. These safe zones were the only sanctuary against the infected. Call them whatever you liked—infected, zombies, flesh-enthusiasts—it didn’t matter once they sunk their teeth into your neck.

Since landing aircraft attracted too many of them, the government started parachuting survivors to safe zones. Survivors arrived safely, sometimes. But “sometimes” is a high rate of success in the apocalypse. As an added bonus, less infected attacked the safe zones after the parachute program began, supposedly because of how quiet parachuting was.

When it was my turn to jump, I strapped on a parachute, stepped out the plane, and prayed I was one of the survivors that sometimes arrived safely.

The air brushed against my face, painting it with fright. My speed increased and my heartbeat increased even faster. Howling in my ears, the wind drowned out my screams.

When I saw the safe zone, I pulled on my main parachute, and it released. Sighing in relief, I gently glided towards salvation. But fate be damned! Suddenly, a burst of wind pushed me off course away from the safe zone and towards the surrounding forest. I tried steering back on track, but the air current took the wheel and had a different destination in mind.

I drifted towards the forest. My parachute then became entangled on the trees and left me suspended on the branches, several meters off the ground. To an infected, I looked like a meat piñata. Soon, a hoard of them came to the party, invited by the sound of me tumbling through the thicket. When I looked around, I saw dozens of other parachutes entangled on the tree branches, some of them with a body still attached. I then realized the real reason why the safe zones stopped getting attacked.

…

It has been hours since I became entangled on these branches, and I’m starting to get hungry. However, the horde below appears even more ravenous.

I wish my parachute failed.";16169012680
Faces;116;5;"My daughter has an active imagination. She plays with fairies, goes swimming with mermaids, and rides with dragons. As most typical mothers, I tend to dismiss her curious claims as just the whims of a child. 

But then she started seeing faces. 

I didn’t really pay attention to it at first. I figured it was just magical nonsense she was creating. It wasn’t until she started struggling with sleep that I took notice.

“They make scary faces, Mommy,” she told me one night. 

She said they were nothing but floating heads. It really creeped me out, but I stayed calm and assured her that she was dreaming. I was hoping that the nights would get better. They didn’t.

My sleep cycle was thrown off. No matter what I said, her story persisted. Disembodied heads floated around her bed. Their faces were contorted in pain and agony. Seeking solace, I opened up about it with my sister. She’s a bit of a horror nerd, so I wasn’t surprised when she sent me some documents about the house’s history. 

As it turns out, a family died of smoke inhalation from a fire 50 years ago. The fire was most likely electrical, but no one ever found out for sure. The family was found all in the same room. That room is now my daughter’s room. 

Instead of being comforted, I was now even more freaked out. The following day, I informed my little girl that she could switch her bedroom if she wanted. She said that was a good idea as the faces had now started talking. 

They were telling her to light the house on fire.";16169197890
Blindness;31;1;"There are remnants of other people. The occasional creaking of floorboard. The passing scent of cheapened white musk my mother used to wear before my accident. A light, door, window left ajar. Remnants are all I have as I live this lonely life in the home I grew up in.

I'd assume two diagnoses: one being that I've suffered neurological damage preventing me from experiencing anything with anyone, a particular blindness that does not allow me to see other people. Ever. Since waking from the accident a little over a four months ago, I have not seen a single soul. I've screamed and cried and yelled, and no one's responded. If my mother was still around, she would assure me that this was a type of psychosis. But it's not. And she's not. 

The second assumed diagnosis, the one I'm actually fearful, is this is real. I'm surrounded by no one. And I'm truly and purely alone.

A few days ago, after months of silence and desperation, a remnant became something tangible. Something real. A chair appeared in the middle of my bedroom. A simple chair. I stared, but ultimately left it. I know I didn't move the chair into my room. It couldn't have been me, right?

Yesterday, a rope appeared. At first, it laid easily on the seat of the chair then, and I swear I saw it happen, it began to loop itself into a familiar knot. A knot with a dreaded history reserved for criminals, oppressed, and the lost. The rope made its way to the ceiling, firmly secure on the fixtures and tugged tightly to hang, ready for... someone.

Today, a note. A note written and laid on my chest  with the simple words: ""End it.""

Before this, before these remnants of a life now forgotten, I lived for nothing. I saw no one. And now, with this chair, with this rope, with this note, I finally have meaning. Invisible signs of a purpose. Today, after months of seeing no one, I have hope.

""The boy killed himself?""

His partner nodded. ""First attempt was carbon monoxide poisoning in the garage. His mother found him and rushed him to the hospital. Second attempt was unfortunately successful.""

""The doctor said something, right? She said a visual impairment after that first attempt?""

Nodding again, ""Something like that. Either visual impairment or hallucination started occurring after that first attempt. The boy claimed to not hear or see anyone.""

""Must have been rough on the mother.""

""She dealt with this behavior for months, doing her best to connect with a son who couldn't see her. He would yell aloud that a table or door or chair would move or appear by itself when it was really his mother just trying to arrange things out of the way for him.""

The partners walked out the room in silence. To be blind to someone's suffering was a fate, they later agreed, they wouldn't wish on anyone.";16169252260
Nope Noodles;187;11;"“Before you take me up to bed, can I tell you a scary story?”

“Can *you* tell *me* a scary story?” I asked the girl. “Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?”

“No. I should tell one. Old people are no good at telling scary stories.”

“I’m not old,” I said, more forcefully than intended.

“What age are you?”

“27.”

“Yeah, see? Old.”

I laughed. We were at the kitchen table. Our game of Monopoly was only half-finished, but it was getting late.

“So, you like scary stories?”

She nodded.

“Okay, you can tell one *as* I take you up to bed. So long as you promise not to call me old again.”

“Promise.”

We walked into the hall, which was chilly and dark.

She held my left hand as we climbed a wooden staircase. “Have you heard about the nope noodles?”

“The internet meme?”

“You know about them?”

“Not really.”

We walked through a long corridor, alternating between darkness and trapezoids of moonlight peeking through the windows on our right-hand side.

“Grown-ups don’t believe in nope noodles. But they’re 100% real.”

After rounding a corner, we continued up a second set of stairs.

“What are they?”

“Monsters that snatch kids.”

I held onto a railing, feeling my way through the dark.

“Okay, and where do the nope noodles take the kids they snatch?”

“Nowhere. I didn’t mean that kinda snatch.”

“I’m confused.”

The girl pushed the bedroom door open. “Okay, so you know crabs?”

“I know *of* them, yes.”

“Nope noodles are like crabs. And kids are like their shells.”

I lifted her onto the bed.

“And when a kid becomes a shell, they stop being…them. They’re more like a costume the nope noodles wears while its growing. The nope noodles tell the kid what to do and how to think. Grown-ups don’t notice the difference because they’re dumb grown-ups. But other kids—the ones the nope noodles haven’t snatched yet—notice. And they warn each other about them. And they even named them. But the grown-ups think it’s a meme beca—”

“Because they’re dumb grown-ups?”

She nodded. “But now the nope noodles are outgrowing the kids. And they need to find bigger shells.”

“Okay, that’s enough—”

“And when that happens,” the girl grabbed my wrist, “all the dumb grown-ups will start believing.”

She opened her mouth. What looked like a tentacle made of yellow earthworms whipped out of it and coiled around my jaw. Somewhere beneath the strands was a pair of eyes.

I struggled to breathe as the nope noodles exited her mouth and entered mine. They felt warm and moist.

I kicked and thrashed but it did no good—the nope noodles just wriggled down my throat. When the tentacle had completely left the girl’s mouth, she fell back on the bed, cold and lifeless.

Soon there was only one strand left, dangling beneath my chin like a leftover piece of spaghetti.

I puckered my lips and slurped it up. Gleefully.";16168868850
Smoking cigarettes saved my life;1009;35;"I’m a very stressful person, smoking cigarettes helps me calm things down. When I’m at work, awkward family meetings, at the park, doesn’t matter. As long as it’s outside you won’t see me without a cigarette for more than two hours.

My parents smoked, their parents smoked, so what? I know it’s bad, trust me I can’t talk to anyone without them bringing it up that I’ll “die before I’m 30”. My roommate hates when I smoke, so I avoid doing it in the apartment. I sit at my window sometimes if I really need to smoke. It always smells up my room though, so I try to avoid doing it there.

I unlocked the apartment door after a long stressful day at work. I had been smoking in the car I think, honestly When you’ve been doing it so much it becomes an unconscious practice. I threw my keys and a pack of cigarettes on the table beside the front door and walked to my room. I said goodnight to my roommate, who was lying on the couch, and fell asleep straight as I got to bed.

I awoke to a series of thuds, ‘must’ve been my upstairs neighbours’ I thought. I sighed and looked at my watch. 5:40am. I got the urge to smoke so I reached for my bedside table. I remembered it was on the table outside my front door so I reluctantly got up walked over. 

I didn’t want to smoke in my room because it would disturb my sleep so I walked down to the outside of my apartment complex. As I finished and put out my cigarette I remembered I forgot to take my phone charger out of my car. Fine. I got my charger and was finally ready to get back to bed.

I opened up my front door and started walking to my bedroom. On my way in I caught a glance of my open bedroom. In the moonlight through the window I could see a figure. It was my roommate, and she looked like she was floating, arms stretched out wide. A cool breeze brushed against my shoulder. I focused my eyes in the dark and when I finally realised what it was I felt sick to my stomach.

My roommate was nailed to the wall in a cross position. Her eyeballs were gouged out and it looked like all her teeth were pulled out too. Hollow eye sockets bled down her face, and long, sharp nails pierced into her limbs. Her stomach was cut open revealing guts and blood.

Smeared on the wall was the antichrist symbol and an array of disturbing images and words, all written in blood, my roommates blood. I threw up on the floor and called the cops. It was a break-in. It was very quick, the police said the murder was planned out beforehand. I had only been gone 20 minutes.

I am so glad I smoke cigarettes.";16168443800
Handmade Furniture Business;21;0;"Earning.

Saving.

Researching.

Spending...

Saws, jigsaws, protractors, compasses, technical illustration pens, colouring pencils, drafting triangles, a jointer, a planer, drafting tables, storage cases, drills, mallets, two-hundred cigarettes for the morning's work, a hammer, screws and screwdrivers, two bottles of whiskey for the night's work, and much more. *Receipts?* Binned.

Passionately I chopped away. Then gathered my efforts, got my tools, and loaded my truck.

I built a chair I'd sketched out. Simple stuff. Next task: a table? A bookshelf? First, I'd need more wood. *Noise complaints?* Never! My nearest neighbours were miles away.

I explored the woods.

After revving my chainsaw I sensed movement in a patch of undergrowth. Not a dog, no, too smooth, yet not the wind, either. I stared grimly, then resumed my work. I rushed to get the job done before it got dim. I started the truck.

As I eyeballed the undergrowth, I saw two strange, dirty-looking faces. I ignored them, focusing on the road.

Once home, I realised I had enough wood for a bookshelf. Excellent.

Soon I'll have many products. *Hopefully*, anyway.

\*

But I couldn't forget those strange faces.

By the woods one night I drove. The empty space I'd created. You could see far in. Tidy ground. Tame wind. The open appearance was...peaceful. I'd separated a boundary between man and nature. The trees didn't intimidate; the space invited exploration, wonder.

However, I was now reluctant to explore it myself.

""They sell you somewhere that's *perfect for you*,"" I spoke to myself, ""with *the best woodland for a man like yourself*. But what they don't tell you is what lurks inside it.""

\*

Consistency.

Four cigarettes...

Half a bottle of whiskey.

I'd rest easy.

Work ethic.

Yawning...

Eyes heavy.

Arms aching.

I stirred.

I awoke.

Raging sweat.

Tapping on the window.

Those two strange faces, lit by my bedside light. Not humans. Not anything I'd ever seen. Mud covering the cheeks, the forehead. The irises bright blue, the hair long, messy. One tapped on the glass again, fingernails longer that matchsticks. They darted away.

999.

""Coming right away.""

I waited forever. Knees up to my chin. Sometimes I heard feet racing around the side of my house. Under the front door hovered a shadow. A second joined it. The fingers probed the door, scratched its surface, then one hand slid through my letterbox. Long fingers appeared. They searched the air, before rapidly withdrawing.

Frantically redialling.

""Hi...I called earlier...Nobody's here...Need my address again?...Yes, twenty minutes ago...No, nothing. Not a single car...Yes, please. That' be appreciated...Shall I wait for your call or...OK, speak shortly.""

Two minutes later...999.

""Sir...it seems...they might've driven to *the wrong address*, I'm quite unsure...""

The letterbox rattled, fingers searching.

The hand went for the letterbox again, while the second beast circled my house.

""Hello? Anyone there?""

I squeezed my eyes shut. This couldn't be happening.

A tap on the patio doors.

I turned around.

One of those long-haired creatures, and a bloodied police officer's hat between its sharp teeth.

""...*SIR*?""";16169198620
Blockage;65;4;"It started with his anus.

As Henry advanced in years he was used to the odd issue but this felt different. He had suffered from constipation before but not this bad. Medication brought little relief.

Now Henry was an old fashioned man and like most men, would only visit the doctor when their worries become too much to handle alone. He had been blocked before and convinced himself it would pass. He would call the doctor in the morning if not.

The next morning he awoke struggling to breath. His nose was blocked and reached for a tissue. He blew but felt a crushing fogginess. Touching his nose he realised his nostrils were sealed shut, a barrier of thick skin in their place.

Henry staggered to his feet and made his way to the bathroom. Looking in the mirror he could see his nostrils gone, his mouth smaller in size and his eyelids starting to grow over his eyes.

Henry numbly pulled his pyjama bottoms down, desperate for a pee.

The pain nearly made him faint.

He looked down to see his urethra welded shut. In a panic, he went to the medicine cabinet and got a pair of scissors. Biting down onto his toothbrush, he slowly reopened the passageway.

Flushing away the blood and piss cocktail, he then needed the toilet again. Frightened, he fingered between his cheeks. His sphincter was sealed behind a wall of skin. His stomach twisted and gargled. He stared at the sanguineous scissors.

Bandaging himself after toileting, he went to the phone and called Doc Copley. He was hurting, so had taken the oramorph he had kept from when his wife was ill.

""Doctor Copley's office,"" Marjorie replied at the other end.

""Mojry?"" He garbled through his puckered mouth.

""Hello?""

""Sh Hry.""

""Sir?""

""ENY!!""

Marjorie couldn't understand. Henry, upset,  put the phone down.

Dressing quickly, he stumbled out of the door to his car. His visibility was vanishing and he couldn't hear a thing either.

Although stressed, he wasn't sweating. Even his pores were closing. He fumbled his way into the car and started to cry. No tears formed. His gut ached and his nerves were burning.

Forcing the keys into the ignition, he turned onto the hill track before his eyes closed completely.

Two days later, Tom and his sister Daphne found Henry's car at the bottom of the hill. Neither recognised the pale, swollen body. As children are, fascination replaced fear and caution.

""Is he dead?"" Daphne asked, pulling her top over her face.

Tom picked up a stick. ""Looking like that, I hope so.""

As Tom poked the body, the head turned. Tom screamed. Daphne backed away.

Then Henry, like a human balloon bloated with gases, fluids and effluent, exploded. The children were drenched.

After washing off Henry's expulsions in the river, Tom and Daphne started to run back to tell their father what they'd found.

""What are we going to say?"" Daphne asked.

Tom never replied.

He couldn't hear her.";16168938710
A Little Hagglin';71;5;"“Fine specimen, is it not?” Piedmont asked with a proud smile, beefy arms crossed over his chest.

“It is,” Carter agreed, looking close at the taxidermy job on the counter.

Mounted on a wooden plaque stood a grey-furred tabby, at least seven years old by Carter’s estimate. The left face had a closed mouth, as if content; the right face had its maw open in a yawn. Looking closer, Carter took note of the hazel color in the right and center eyes, while the left was blue. Diprosopus *and* heterochromia; a rare find indeed.

Carter nodded in approval. Piedmont saw this and leaned down with an elbow on the counter.

“Be looking good on your mantel, no?” He asked, eyes a-twinkle. “We be making deal, yes?”

Carter was quiet for a few seconds, then smiled. “Yes, I believe so. How much?”

“Ten,” Piedmont said instantly.

Carter hummed, hands in his pockets. “Five.”

Piedmont lost his smile. “Oy, what is this? You come into my shop and trying to lowball me?”

“I’m just making an honest offer,” Carter said smoothly.

“Five for this beauty? Be thinking not. Ten.”

Carter rocked on his heels, glancing closely at the feline before he spoke again. “You know Mr. Piedmont, you could stand to do some spring cleaning.”

Piedmont furrowed his brow. “Oy, now you be *insulting* me?”

“Just an observation. Couldn’t help but notice the dust build up there on the bottom edges of the plaque. Almost like it’s been sitting for a *long* time on that shelf up there. A year or two? Maybe more?”

Piedmont was silent.

“How many people have even asked to see it?”

Silence.

Carter kept smiling. “I’m making a good offer to take this baby off your hands. Or I can walk away and you can have it taking up shelf space for a few more years. What’ll it be, Piedmont?”

Silence. Then: “Eight.”

“Five.”

“Seven.”

“*Five.*”

More silence.

Finally, Piedmont exhaled loudly through his nose. “You be driving hard bargain Mr. Carter. Five it is.”

Carter nodded, satisfied. From his pocket he produced five severed human fingers, idly dropping them on the counter beside the cat. A wedding ring hit the glass with a *tink*, while another left a drop of red where it landed. A third rolled off the counter, landing in Piedmont’s outstretched palm.

“Ah, be having some fresh ones in here,” the proprietor said, eyeing the finger that was still leaking crimson.

“Yeah, got that one just this morning,” Carter said as he picked up his purchase. “Came from a real fighter, that one did.”

“Well, is going to good home,” Piedmont said as he gathered up the digits. “Pleasure to being doing business with you.”

“You too, friend.”

Carter whistled a merry tune as he walked out of the shop, taxidermied cat tucked under one arm.

Nothing to put you in a good mood like getting a five finger discount.";16168799500
Lucid dreams;35;3;"I layed in the soft sand. The same soft sand that was filling my lungs and nostrils was like a bed to me. The waves striked my legs. I opened my eyes and a beautiful night sky layed upon me. My legs, head and arms burned with excruciating agony. I got up, my legs buckled beneath me. Every step on that infinite beach seemed like a mile. The waves striked the sand so elegantly and calmy. The stars were twisted and the moon was so calm it was unsetelling.

I walked only for a moment, but that little moment lasted a few hours. My legs overcame me and i fell to the ground. I couldn't bare the pain anymore and I closed my eyes.

-What are you doing son?- a voice pierced my ears.

I opened my eyes, a figure stood upon me. His beard reached down to his bare feet, he had no eyes and a white cloth covered his frale body. He lended me his hand and i took it. He was frale but tall. We started walking, the pain in my legs seemingly vanished.

-You know this is a rare accurance, most people are long gone before i could save them.- he said calmly.

-Where am I.- I murmured.

-You're not actually here.- he chuckled a little.

- The waves and the sand save people like you,- he continued, -the moon and stars control them, i just try to save more people.-

-They don't like me much here Jim.- he said sadly.

I dared not ask him how he knew my name. We walked for a while. He seemingly held back his happiness, i didn't ask any questions, and nor did he, I simply didn't have it in me I guess.  

The walk lasted a few hours, calmness beyond explanation.

-We part our ways here son.- he turned in my direction, skin and flesh in the place his eyes should've been pierced through me.

-Wait!- i exclaimed, he just continued walking

He continued walking until he vanished off of the horizon. I knew i had missed my chance to ask more questions so i sat down and excepted my fate. I slowly closed my eyes.

I woke up in a ambulance, two nurses beside me.

-W..what happend?- i asked weakly.

- Attempted suicide.- the nurse on the left said.

I coughed, my lungs burned.

-you're real lucky you know, if someone hadn't called us you would've drowned- the other nurse said 

-who called the ambulance?- i said not exepting an exciting response.

-We don't know that.- the nurse on the left said, she stopped herself from giving any other information so she wouldn't excite me to much.

We arrived at the hospital, the injuries weren't that severe. I've cleaned up my act since then. I return to that beach every single night and close my eyes wishing to return to that calm beach again, to see the man again. Sometimes i feel the waves striking my legs and i open my eyes to the twisted stars and calm moon. Yesterday i heard that familiar voice say ""son.""";16168756150
Our youngest is going through his 5th puberty;45;1;"Oh puberty what a time for the kids and the parents. The never ending mood swings and they grow up so fast into their adulthood. My wife and I have 6 kids and before you ask we could afford each and one of them or otherwise we wouldn't have had kids. Anyhow our youngest who is now 21 is currently going through his 5th puberty and as parents we feel so blessed to see our youngest child (Eric) grow and change again. Eric was a bit of a late bloomer at 16. 

When he first went through puberty he had gained a deep voice and became taller and hairier. We couldn't believe that our youngest was now entering adulthood. As parents when you see your child going through puberty, it's kind of a relief because you got them this far. 

Then at 17 Eric went through puberty again and became more taller and gained sharp teeth and claws. His ears started to grow out like elves and he ate his older sister who is our 5th oldest child. We didn't blame Eric for eating his sister as we blamed it on puberty. Then at 18 years old Eric went through puberty again and his appearance took on more changes as he grew a tail and became hairy. His face became more defined like between a werewolf and a skin walker. He ate his older brother this time who is our 4th oldest child. We blamed it on puberty as hunger can grow so much during puberty. 

Then at 19 he went through his 3rd round of puberty! and he was able to walk on walls and see in the dark. He grew wings and was able to speak many languages through verbal and telepathic means. Oh the changes children go through. He killed his other older brother who is our 3rd oldest child. Then at 20 he went through puberty again for the 4th time. He grew more taller and his claws and teeth more defined and his tongue stretched out more. He could also move things with his mind. He ate his other older sister who is our second oldest child. 

At 21 he has gone through his 5th puberty and has become so muscular over night to the point he is like a body builder. His knees and elbows have a knife life shape. Our oldest child is frightened and is arguing with us to get rid of Eric. My wife and I both laughed telling our eldest child that Eric is just going through his 5th puberty.";16168679560
The Noise;20;1;"Click.....Click...Click

Ah my favorite lullaby

I'll admit it; It was frightening at the beginning. I would rush to the hallway with my heart racing to check where the noise came from. The damned clicking noise never seemed to stop.

Was it from that room...Nah couldn't be

I would convince myself that I am paranoid and would somehow go to sleep amidst the noise.

The noise slowly started to grow on me. It had a nice rhythm to it, I joked to myself.

&#x200B;

It did stop one day.

I was waiting for it to start so I could sleep. But there was no noise. I tried to sleep but I missed the noise so much. So I figured it's time.

Folk of the Shaded Places;17;1;"""The house I grew up in was roughly on the corner of three different reservations. Depending on where I played, the front, the drive or the wild backyard, I was on the land of a different nation. Since each time-of-day favored a different location for me, I daily traversed each. To me, as a child, they were all the same realm. The only difference is where I happened to be standing, and that was who I was. Is childhood a kind of wisdom, where we just see naturally and without prejudice? Or should we be afraid that we were just naive? My deepest fear, is to be governed by such a fear. Not Death."" The old man sitting on the bench was saying to God. Alone.

He had to make his peace. He had come here to meet the Folk of the Shaded Places. He had brought two weapons: his grandson's slingshot and an uzi.

They were listening, wondering at his strange words and tone-of-voice. Then they shrugged and silently came for him, in broad daylight. These were extremely hungry ones, they could not be sated by any amount of human flesh. As the bulldozers tore through their old paths, they had to find new ones. They took as they went, marauding.

He stood suddenly and looked directly at them. They froze, realizing he could see them there, even in the overcast darkness of the bowered shade. He squinted, their shape was far more horrifying than he had imagined. There was nothing even vaguely humanoid about them at all, more centipede-oid than human. Or spiders. 

He shrugged, not concerned with the very nasty looking creatures that were worse than anything imaginable. His heart was broken, these had taken his grandson, destroyed his family, ravaged his neighborhood.

""I'm the epilogue."" He said plainly as they advanced, even though this man could see them, somehow. ""Nobody ever came to take you, instead.""

The creatures were just coming into the light when he revealed his weapon. They didn't recognize it and were at the perfect range as they came from the shade. They glamoured themselves to look like people as they did, as their laws demanded. The illusion did not protect them.

Unlike most things, these dissolved into the ichor of nightmares when they died. As they died, flashes of light and lead tearing them apart like the animals they were. Just flesh and bone.

The police found no bodies, even though witnesses said he had shot several people. He seemed like a very nice old man who had discharged a deadly weapon in public. The judge sentenced him to a retirement home.";16168855990
Womb Tomb;937;70;"Now, I’m not saying it’s normal, or even remotely safe, but I do believe the positives *far* outweighs the negatives. 

Sure, they’ll have you think it’s illegal. Or immoral. Perverted even. And you know, maybe it’s all those things *and more,* but in the grand scheme of things, you can’t let it stop you. Progress has a price, and that price, albeit steep and uncompromising, is ultimately worth it.

Hmm? Oh, it’s your sanity. The cost is your sanity. What good is it anyway, am I right? It never did anything for *you*, ha-ha-ha. 

So, just imagine this, there you are, baby in hand. Big beautiful boy, maybe a girl, what do I know, it’s your fantasy. Doesn’t matter though, because you *know*, deep in your soul, that it’ll grow up to be a disappointment. It’s inevitable. We’re all disappointments. Can’t be helped. It’s just the human way.

So what do you do? Just toss it in the bin? No, that’s not right, is it? They don’t like that, the mindless sheep of society. Probably immoral. Illegal at the very least. So then what? Do you just give up, and let it suckle upon the rotting teat of humanity until it withers away and dies? 

No, of course not. You give it to me. I’ll handle that shit for you. Free of charge. 

So, I can tell that you’re not convinced, and I feel you. I *get* you. Let me explain though, because it’s as simple as it is ingenious. I have several of them now, monitored and preserved, don’t you worry. All about humane treatment here, let me assure you. They’re alive, *sort of*. They don’t live, or experience, or even think for the most part, but they are, biologically speaking, still alive. That’s important. Makes all the difference.

I’ll cut them open, still unconscious mind you, I’m not a monster, ha-ha-ha. Uteri (is the plural form of ‘uterus’ *uteri*?) exposed, I’ll gently tear it open, and place the future disappointment within. It won’t like it, but it’ll come to accept it. Not like it has a choice, ha-ha-ha.

Then I’ll sutur the surrogate right up, and let her and her newly entombed womb boone take a big old dirt nap. 

No, not like that, I just mean that I’ll cover the incubator with earth again. You know, like a burial chamber? That’s the name, see? Womb Tomb. The name is the game.

Oh yeah, it’ll die. They both will.

What do you mean, why? There is no reason. It just is. Science? I guess. Mostly though, I just like doing fucked up shit just *because*.

So, I’ll ask again, one last time. Will you just lie still for a moment? It ain’t gonna hurt much. Just need to get that disappointment out of you, and I’ll be on my way. You’ll live, maybe.

Or, you know, you could join me? Do you want that? Do you want to sleep forever?

Do you want to become a Womb Tomb?";16168062500
The monsters in my house;16;2;"Ugh, I can't fuckin take it anymore. These three little motherfuckers are gonna get it soon. They live in my house, steal my food, and now this? Stalking around at night, scars on their bodies, mostly inflicted by me... eesh, I'm getting the heebie-jeebies just thinking about those little bitches. I'm gonna kill them soon. Just got a gun license the other day, for this very purpose. I hate them so much. They cost too much. I'll be living out in the streets pretty soon if they don't fuck right off. This stupid piece of shit diary is the only thing keeping me on  the verge of sanity. Tonight I'm gonna end it.

Yes, finally! They're out of my life! Spent a whole round on 'em, but it was worth every last bullet. My neighbors were horrified at what they saw when they came over to see what the gunshots were all about. They'd never understand. These little creatures are gone from my life now. Y'know, maybe I'll tell the newspapers. I can already see the headline now: ""Man, 39, kills monsters in his home in brave act of self defense"". I'll be rich!



MAN, 39, KILLS CHILDREN IN HOME IN SAN ANTONIO

Yesterday, a man killed his own children at his home in San Antonio. The man, called Austin Richards, was diagnosed as clinically insane on the same day, and has been taken to an asylum for corrective measures. When interviewed, he... [cont'd on page 9]";16168830760
The Goodnight Protocol;673;24;"In 1971, right in the scorched heart of the Cold War, a group of government officials from every current Nuclear Power met in a tiny bunker outside of Guarda, Switzerland to plan the end of the world. These were all rogue agents, powerful men (and one woman) who were all ready for it to be over. The war. The fighting. The tension. So this clique of six dispirited individuals came to a resolution that night after dinner but prior to drinks: they would do everything in their power to influence their countries to begin a nuclear armageddon.

They labeled this pact the **Goodnight Protocol** and it still exists today.

Lines change on the map, countries wax and wane and, occasionally, shatter like the Soviets. But the protocol remains. The group has even grown as new powers bring weapons of mass destruction online. Always, without fail, there are some individuals rooted high in those governments that want to wipe the slate clean. They’ve come close before, so very close. Three times in the last forty years, the **Goodnight Protocol** was activated and humanity leaned over the edge. Each time, a combination of luck and the actions of a handful of brave, careful souls pulled us back from extinction. But every close call entrenches the members of the protocol a little further into the system like worms in a corpse.

One day, they will succeed. Our existence is too fragile, our safeguards too dependent on the whims of careless rulers. All it will take is one bad day. One man, or woman, who holds the Last Key will eventually turn it. The *l'appel du vide* can only be resisted for so long and always, *always*, the **Goodnight Protocol** is waiting, whispering, grinning.

Do you know what it feels like to be caught in the path of a nuclear bomb? If you’re lucky, you’ll feel nothing at all. Just a painless bright flash that paints your shadow onto the ground. A little further out, it still won’t hurt. The air will be sucked out of your lungs so fast that it will rip your insides out through your mouth, but the trauma will be severe enough that shock will cradle you gently in the moment or two it takes before your brain realizes you’re dead.

No, the ones who will suffer the most are the ones who survive. Great clouds of radiation will cover the skies. Sickness and cancer will ride pale horses. Food and water will be only memories. Sooner or later, we’ll all die shrieking.

*Goodnight*.

Cal stood up. His son, Ryan, lay shivering in bed, covers pulled close.

“Why did you tell him all of that? It’s horrible,” Cal’s wife Sinéad whispered as the man left the room.

Cal shrugged. “Little fucker asked me for a bedtime story. I’m fairly certain he won’t ask again.”";16167900290
Tao po;27;5;"I turn my head back towards the house, trying to determine if I had actually heard the knocking. It comes again and I quickly stand. I wipe the dirt off my hands as I make my way in and through the house. 

Again a knock comes.

""Tao po!"" Comes the sing-songy voice of my granddaughter. 

I open the door. 

""Tala, come..."" 

The smell of the Aswang that had used my granddaughters voice hit me before its claws and teeth. 

As I  lay there, feeling the life drain from me, I stare at the tape recorder laying where the Aswang had dropped it. 

""Tao po!... Tao po!... Tao po!.....""";16168470860
